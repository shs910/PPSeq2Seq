The Government's decision to repeal martial law was endorsed by royal decree of 30 March 1992.	0
Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. 	1
The “special situation” regime was again introduced in this area from 19 January to 1 March 1994.	0
From 18 May to 17 June 1993, a partial suspension of certain constitutional rights and guarantees was decreed in some parts of the country.	0
Niger: A state of emergency has been in force in the north of the country since 1992.	0
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington! Call Washington!" 	1
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. 	1
 But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. 	1
Sources: Letters from the Government dated 1 September 1988 and 6 July 1989 (cf. E/CN.4/Sub.2/1989/45); information submitted by the Special Committee against Apartheid; information received from non-governmental organizations.	0
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. 	1
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. 	1
United States States of emergency proclaimed and curfews imposed in	0
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. 	1
Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. 	1
1. At its forty—eighth session, on 29 August 1996, the Sub—Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted decision 1996/112, entitled “Methods of work of the Sub—Commission”.	0
Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. 	1
Total post—session documentation requirements	0

Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. 	1
So you could imagine they were very excited about it. 	1
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. 	1
And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. 	1
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. 	1
After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here. 	1
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. 	1
Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. 	1
Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires. 	1
7. The better to understand the final stage of the study, it must be shown how this report fits into the work of the Sub—Commission.	0
16. The following three sections summarize the overall presentation of the set of principles and their justification in reference to victims' rights:	0
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. 	1
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing. 	1
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead. 	1
Similarly, prescription cannot be invoked against civil, administrative or disciplinary actions brought by victims.	0
But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward. 	1
35. Unlike most Roman—law countries, the common—law countries' legal systems do not acknowledge trial in absentia.	0
This gives a significant fillip to impunity, especially when the countries concerned refuse to cooperate with justice (for example, the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague).	0
As a compromise, trial in absentia might be countenanced once it has been legally established that cooperation was being refused.	0
Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. 	1
My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. 	1
43. As the same causes produce the same effects, three steps are necessary to prevent victims from having to face renewed encroachments on their dignity:	0
This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this. 	1
(c) Removal from office of senior officials implicated in serious violations.	0
Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943? 	1
(a) The “courts of opinion”, in particular the Russell Tribunal, later the Standing People's Tribunal, which in the absence of an international tribunal — under study at the United Nations since 1946 — filled an institutional lacuna in the face of rampant impunity (see Louis Joinet, “Les tribunaux d'opinion”, in Marxisme, démocratie et droit des peuples, Hommage à Lelìo Basso, (Milan, Editions Franco Angelis, 1979) p. 821);	0
How is it possible to combat impunity and ensure a victim's right to justice when the number of people imprisoned on suspicion of serious human rights violations is so large that it is technically impossible to try them in fair hearings within a reasonable period of time?	0
It is also vain to imagine that an international criminal tribunal offers a solution.	0
Principle 1: The inalienable right to the truth	0
And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. 	1
Will democracy flourish? What scares you most? 	1
So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. 	1
Principle 18: Specific measures relating to archives containing names	0
The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. 	1

Principle 30: Restrictions on extradition	0
And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here -- separate. 	1
Principle 42: Measures of rehabilitation	0
Principle 45: Areas affected by guarantees of non-repetition	0
Considering that the duty of every State under international law to respect and to secure respect for human rights requires that effective measures should be taken to combat impunity,	0
This term, as used in these principles, covers war crimes, crimes against humanity, including genocide, and grave breaches of and crimes against international humanitarian law.	0
Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion. 	1
Irrespective of any legal proceedings, victims, their families and dear ones have the right to know the truth about the circumstances in which violations took place and, in the event of death or disappearance, the victim's fate.	0
You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. 	1
If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period. 	1
Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus. 	1
(a) Shall be established by law or, depending on the circumstances, by a contractual instrument or treaty clause concluding a process of national dialogue or a peace accord;	0
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs. 	1
(ii) To safeguard evidence for later use in the administration of justice;	0
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. 	1
Priority shall initially be given to drawing up inventories of the archives stored including, with their cooperation, those held in third countries, and ascertaining the reliability of existing inventories.	0
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. 	1
(a) A provision on universal jurisdiction applicable to serious crimes under international law should be included in all international human rights instruments dealing with such crimes.	0
Prescription — of prosecution or penalty — in criminal cases shall not run while no effective remedies are in existence.	0
And in it also brings up another point, right here. 	1
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. 	1
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. 	1
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. 	1
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? 	1
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this. 	1
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. 	1
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing. 	1
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. 	1
Compensation must equal the financially assessable value of all damage suffered, particularly:	0
(b) The loss of an opportunity, including educational opportunities;	0
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. 	1
That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's an avatar. 	1
And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive. 	1
In assessing the situation of each serving official, consideration will be given to:	0
We don't really have a problem talking about love. 	1
However, in view of the special circumstances inherent in any transition period, the appeal may be heard by an ad hoc commission with exclusive jurisdiction, provided that it meets the criteria of independence, impartiality and procedure laid down in principles 6, 7 (a), 8 (a) and (b) and 10.	0
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers. 	1
And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK, that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female. 	1
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue. 	1
There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too. 	1

You know, that's what I have to do sometimes. 	1
Third stage 4. With the end of the cold war symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall, this period was marked by many processes of democratization or return to democracy along with peace agreements putting an end to internal armed conflicts.	0
It recommends adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity.	0
Following the submission of the working paper (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1992/18), the Sub—Commission decided, by its resolution 1992/23, to request the co-authors to draft a study on the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights.	0
However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. 	1
13. Forty—seventh session (August 1995).	0
Lacking the time to consider the report, the Sub—Commission requested the Special Rapporteur (decision 1996/119) to continue consultations and to submit to it at its forty—ninth session a final version, revised and extended, incorporating a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity.	0
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. 	1
I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing? 	1
(a) Guaranteed independence and impartiality	0
They may be established by an act of general application or treaty clause in the event that the restoration of or transition to democracy and/or peace has begun.	0
Their members may not be subject to dismissal during their terms of office, and they must be protected by immunity.	0
If necessary, a commission should be able to seek police assistance, to call for testimony and to visit places involved in their investigations.	0
22. Testimony should be taken from victims and witnesses testifying on their behalf only on a voluntary basis.	0
26. This implies that all victims shall have the opportunity to assert their rights and receive a fair and effective remedy, ensuring that their oppressors stand trial and that they obtain reparations.	0
Those trying the perpetrators of violations must themselves respect human rights.	0
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass. 	1
It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. 	1
The absence of such a procedure significantly benefits impunity, especially when the countries concerned refuse to cooperate with the courts (such as the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague).	0
37. In cases where legislation on repentance has been adopted as part of the restoration of or transition to democracy, such legislation may be advanced in mitigation of evidence but cannot completely exonerate repentant perpetrators; a distinction must be drawn, depending on what risks the perpetrators ran, between revelations made while grave violations were taking place and those made subsequently.	0
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light. 	1
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families? 	1
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. 	1
(b) Repeal of all emergency laws, abolition of emergency courts and recognition of the inviolability and non—derogability of habeas corpus; and	0
(b) The international meeting concerning impunity for perpetrators of gross human rights violations, held at the Palais des Nations, Geneva, by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and the National Advisory Committee on Human Rights (CNCDH—France) from 2 to 5 November 1992 (the records of the meeting were published by the ICJ under the title Non à l'impunité, oui à la justice, Geneva, 1993);	0
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations. 	1
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. 	1
At a meeting held at the Palais des Nations on 13 December 1996 to prepare for the commemoration, the High Commissioner further stated that the event should be not only an occasion for celebration, but also an opportunity to undertake practical measures to continue strengthening human rights for all people.	0
If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future. 	1
As a means of adding a practical note to commemoration activities, it is proposed that it be recommended that the High Commissioner for Human Rights, within the framework of the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, take appropriate steps on the occasion of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to change the date of 10 December, now Human Rights Day, into the “World Day for Human Rights and Action Against Impunity”.	0
And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade. 	1
49. To those who might be tempted to regard the set of principles proposed here as an obstacle to national reconciliation, I would answer this: these principles are not legal standards in the strict sense, but guiding principles intended not to thwart reconciliation but to avoid distortions in certain reconciliation policies so that, once beyond the first stage, which is more concerned with “conciliation” than reconciliation, the foundations of a “just and lasting reconciliation” may be laid.	0
The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. 	1

This is the original Mac operating system. 	1
PRINCIPLE 1. THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO THE TRUTH	0
A people's knowledge of the history of its oppression is part of its heritage and, as such, must be preserved by appropriate measures in fulfilment of the State's duty to remember.	0
PRINCIPLE 6. GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY	0
And the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?" 	1
PRINCIPLE 9. GUARANTEES FOR VICTIMS AND WITNESSES TESTIFYING ON THEIR BEHALF	0
(ii) That the chairman and one member of the commission are entitled to verify that the request for anonymity is warranted and to ascertain, in confidence, the identity of the witness, so as to be able to give assurances to the other members of the Commission;	0
The commissions' terms of reference shall include provisions calling for them to make recommendations on action to combat impunity in their final report.	0
These measures shall primarily concern the army, police and judicial system and the strengthening of democratic institutions, and, where applicable, reparation for violations of the fundamental rights of women and prevention of their recurrence.	0

 You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. 	1

 Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. 	1
(b) All persons shall be entitled to know whether their name appears in the archives and, if it does, by virtue of their right of access, to challenge the validity of the information concerning them by exercising a right of reply.	0
If that person was already in charge of the archive centre, he or she must be explicitly reappointed by special decision, subject to the modalities and guarantees provided in principle 41;	0
This option should be extended to non-governmental organizations with recognized long-standing activities on behalf of the victims concerned.	0
PRINCIPLE 19. JURISDICTION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURTS	0
In such an event, the international criminal court may at any point in the proceedings require the national court to relinquish a case to it.	0
The jurisdiction of foreign courts may be exercised by virtue either of a universal jurisdiction clause contained in a treaty in force or of a provision of domestic law establishing a rule of extraterritorial jurisdiction for serious crimes under international law.	0
I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss. 	1
Under article 1, paragraph 2, of the Declaration on Territorial Asylum, adopted by the General Assembly on 14 December 1967, and article 1 F of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, States may not extend such protective status, including diplomatic asylum, to persons with respect to whom there are serious reasons to believe that they have committed a serious crime under international law.	0
I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. 	1
PRINCIPLE 28. RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXCLUSION OF IN ABSENTIA PROCEDURE	0
The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. 	1
When disclosures were made during the period of persecution, the reduction of sentence may be extended to absolute discharge on grounds of the risks the person ran at the time.	0
  Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. 	1
But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted. 	1
Exercise of the right to reparation includes access to the applicable international procedures.	0
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. 	1
(c) Administrative or other measures against State officials implicated in gross human rights violations.	0
(d) Draw up a reconversion plan to ensure that members of such groups are not tempted to join the ranks of organized crime.	0
Habeas corpus, whatever name it may be known by, must be considered a fundamental right of the individual and as such a non—derogable right.	0
Decisions shall be taken by the head of Government or, under his responsibility, by the minister under whom the official works, after the official concerned has been informed of the complaints against him and has been given a due hearing or summons for this purpose.	0
Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate." 	1
Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. 	1

II. ISSUES RELATED TO THE DEPRIVATION OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE 9 — 13 4	0
The following experts were appointed as members of the working group on 6 August 1997: Mr. Stanislav Chernichenko (Eastern Europe), Mr. Alberto Diaz Uribe (Latin America), Ms. Lucy Gwanmesia (Africa), Mr. Louis Joinet (Western European and other States) and Mr. Sang Yong Park (Asia).	0
JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. 	1
Working paper submitted by Mr. Miguel Alfonso Martínez concerning the study of the issue of the privatization of prisons (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1991/56);	0
Outline prepared by Ms. Claire Palley pursuant to Sub-Commission decision 1992/107 on the possible utility, scope and structure of a special study on the issue of privatization of prisons (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/21);	0
So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team. 	1
8. Provisional agenda for the next session.	0
The Chairman/Rapporteur considered that such a meeting might take place in the autumn of 1997 and he therefore suggested that consideration of the agenda item should be postponed until the next session of the Working Group.	0
A progress report on the abolition and maintenance of the death penalty throughout the world had been drawn up.	0
Regarding the latter cases, he emphasized the desirability of moving on to legal abolition, which would constitute a better safeguard.	0
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. 	1
DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather." 	1
18. Mr. Guissé and Ms. Gwanmesia said that both the content of any communication with the Human Rights Committee and the way it would be addressed to the Committee should be approved by the plenary of the Sub—Commission.	0
“While the Covenant does not use the terms 'habeas corpus' or 'amparo', it contains several provisions which guarantee the essence of the habeas corpus writ and aspects of the amparo procedure which are similar in impact to habeas corpus.	0
These developments have occurred because of the recognition that without the ability to challenge the legality of one’s detention, especially in times of public emergency, one will never be assured of the other fundamental rights in the Covenant.	0
“Accordingly, it is recommended that the Human Rights Committee consider preparing a new general comment on article 4 which reaffirms the developing consensus that habeas corpus and the related aspects of amparo, as well as cognate rights, should be considered to be non-derogable.”	0
At the criminal level, it was desirable to encourage proposals concerning genocide by omission or by complicity and rejection of the doctrine of “owed obedience”.	0
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this." 	1
He emphasized that such a body should be distinct from any international criminal court, which could not function effectively for many years.	0
The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. 	1
Such a working group would have both a preventive and a repressive role to play.	0
He referred to the work done by Mr. Cherif Bassiouni on the investigations conducted in the former Yugoslavia.	0
He suggested that the report should be submitted at the next session of the Sub—Commission.	0
She urged that probation officers be appointed and that special institutions be established for the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.	0
Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. 	1
So the notion of collaboration -- I think this reinforces how important that is. 	1
And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. 	1
36. At the 2nd meeting, Mr. Weissbrodt provided the working group with a document concerning the development of guidelines in order to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to encourage the countries which had not done so to ratify the Convention*.	0
In this connection, Mr. Alfonso Martínez stated that Mr. Weissbrodt's proposal should be brought to the attention of the Sub—Commission and eventually transmitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.	0
Noting that the privatization of prisons was gaining ground, Ms. Palley stated that, especially in those countries where corruption was a serious problem, the human rights of detainees could be massively violated and all manner of abuses permitted.	0
The fact that building industry enterprises and security companies were sometimes linked to organized crime could be seen as an additional element which would definitively worsen the general picture.	0
40. Mr. Alfonso Martínez confirmed that privatization processes applied to the judicial machinery had been a main concern of the Sub-Commission in the 1980s, but because of the historical period no action had been taken since then.	0
DR: Right. And we're looking for other things. 	1
KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform? 	1
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished, is part of its extraordinary -- I don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence. 	1
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something. 	1
53. The members of the working group, after exchanging opinions on the paper, decided that it could discuss the draft declaration if the continuation of this work were sanctioned by the Sub-Commission.	0
55. Mr. Guissé said that he had been wondering about the size of the study, which was similar to that of a final report.	0
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it. 	1
Concerning paragraph 68, he questioned what procedure could be applied if a State, first, did not voluntarily acknowledge its responsibility and, second, if the international community failed to take coercive measures against the State concerned.	0
He reiterated that his study did not duplicate the work of the International Law Commission.	0
It was decided that the procedure to be followed would be the same as that adopted for the document on habeas corpus.	0
“The Sub—Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities decided to request the working group on the administration of justice to continue its consideration of the expanded working paper prepared by Mr. Stanislav Chernichenko entitled Recognition of gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of Governments, or sanctioned by them as an international crime (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/29) and for this purpose to transmit the expanded working paper, through the Secretary-General, to the International Law Commission, so that the Commission’s comments may be considered at the next session of the working group.”	0
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. 	1
63. At its 3rd meeting, on 15 August 1997, the working group unanimously adopted the present report to the Sub-Commission.	0
And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane, and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient, both from an engineering point of view, an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view. 	1
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. 	1
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSALS 44 - 54 20 GE.97-13087 page	0
The proposals made reduced to giving the task a specific form.	0
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices. 	1
 So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology. 	1
"1. Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.	0
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, "And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore. 	1
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took. 	1
We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it. 	1
7. However, other articles of the Covenant are equally relevant to the understanding of the right to freedom of movement.	0
Article 4 of the Covenant on public emergencies allows States to take measures derogating from their obligations under the Covenant only to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and respect the principle of non-discrimination.	0
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency. 	1
Similar provisions can also be found in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.	0
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. 	1
Therefore, irrespective of whether the agreement has entered into force or not and is binding or merely makes recommendations, in order to understand the right to freedom of movement it is important carefully to analyse the provisions of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families of 18 December 1990, ILO Convention (No. 97) concerning Migration for Employment (Revised) of 1 July 1949, ILO Convention (No. 118) concerning Equality of Treatment of Nationals and Non-Nationals in Social Security of 28 June 1962, ILO Convention (No. 143) concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers of 24 June 1975, ILO Recommendation (No. 86) (Revised) concerning Migration for Employment of 1 July 1949, ILO Recommendation (No. 151) concerning Migrant Workers of 24 June 1975, etc.	0
A positive approach to freedom of movement and, in particular, to the right to leave a country and return has also been adopted in almost all the regional human rights instruments.	0
Firstly, many of the instruments listed and others not mentioned were adopted after the corresponding studies had been carried out and, naturally, were not considered by the Special Rapporteurs.	0
from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. 	1
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted. 	1
19. In fact, the mandate of the Special Rapporteur remained essentially unchanged, comprising the same article 13, paragraph 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights plus the brain drain problem and a reference to article 12, paragraph 3 of the Covenant, where the permissible restrictions are listed.	0
And so, coming directly from there to here. 	1
The law or practice may hedge the right with so many conditions as to whittle it away or render it nugatory" (E/CN.4/Sub.2/220, paras. 16 and 17).	0
21. As regards the solution of problems of freedom of movement, the Special Rapporteur Mr. C.L.C. Mubanga-Chipoya concentrated his attention on questions of the participation of the State in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.	0
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. 	1
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. 	1
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer. 	1
In the rush, the new laws adopted have not always come up to generally accepted standards.	0
Sometimes they have even further confused the legal situation of the individual.	0
 We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. 	1
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years. 	1
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. 	1
Luzhkov, has signed an order introducing "Temporary regulations concerning the special procedure governing the residence in the city of Moscow - capital of the Russian Federation - of citizens living permanently outside Russia".	0
But in the Ukraine we cannot turn to the law enforcement services.	0
Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. 	1
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. 	1
As noted by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Ms. Elizabeth Rehn, in the periodic report "Situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia", the Dayton Agreement "expressly commits the parties to ensuring freedom of movement and incorporates international law guaranteeing this right. ...	0
It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. 	1
42. The Special Rapporteur C.L.C. Mubanga-Chipoya was overoptimistic when he concluded that: "Freedom of movement within the country ... has progressed substantially and only a few examples could be mentioned of the limitation of this freedom."E/CN.4/Sub.2/1988/35, para. 512.	0
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. 	1
In his view, "the recourse procedures included in national legislations should be left to independent judicial or non-judicial bodies".	0
Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. 	1
50. At its 2nd meeting on 6 August 1996, the Sub-Commission decided to add to its agenda a new sub-item 18 (c) entitled "The right of everyone to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country".	0
Initially, Mr. Meneses-Pallares proposed the consideration of "discriminatory practices in the field of migration".	0
However, the Sub-Commission chose to study "measures to combat discrimination, including in the field of immigration and travel".	0
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. 	1
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. 	1
Today I want to talk to you about the future, but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past. 	1
It seems that the scope of this study should not extend beyond the limits of articles 12 and 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.	0
And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books. 	1
The Committee called upon the Office of the High Commissioner, States parties and all other interested parties to support this Programme of Action.	0
6. Also during its fifteenth session, the Committee continued and concluded its consideration of a draft optional protocol providing for the right of individuals or groups to submit communications concerning non-compliance with the Covenant, as recommended by the World Conference on Human Rights (see E/C.12/1996/SR.44-49 and 54).	0
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought, "Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth." 	1
At first when I heard of cancer stem cells, I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells, and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps. 	1
It may be noted that several country projects developed under the Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance of the High Commissioner/Centre for Human Rights include national training courses on reporting obligations under international human rights instruments.	0
Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. 	1
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination	0
18. During its forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions, held in August 1996 and March 1997 respectively, the Committee considered reports submitted by 23 States parties to the Convention.	0
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue. 	1
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. 	1
Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. 	1
31. A meeting of States parties took place on 18 February 1997 at which elections were held.	0
32. At its fifteenth session, six new members of the Committee made their solemn declaration.	0
THE UNITED NATIONS INSTRUMENTS IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS	0
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors, and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines, and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. 	1
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. 	1
Sub—Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities	0
The ratification campaign focuses on conventions Nos. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, 111 and 138.	0
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife. 	1
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere. 	1
Specific efforts in this domain so far have concentrated on promoting full, productive and freely chosen employment, and consolidating national institutions and labour relations.	0
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure. 	1
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?" 	1
14. With regard to women workers’ rights, a pilot project funded by the Government of the Netherlands, is being implemented in nine countries in the five regions.	0
The project emphasizes active participation of the national constituents.	0
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like. 	1
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time. 	1
The key concern of these standards is non-discrimination or equality of opportunity and treatment.	0
Apart from its ongoing activities related to international migration for employment, such as technical advisory services to migrant-sending countries in the field of setting up coherent emigration and return policies, ILO has engaged in several activities aimed explicitly at promoting the protection of migrant workers and reducing discrimination against them.	0
Thus far, the project’s research findings indicate that employment discrimination against migrants is widespread and routine, and that in many of the countries investigated, migrants stand as much as a one-in-three chance of being discriminated against at the stage of recruitment.	0
The conclusions of the project will be drawn at national, regional and international seminars scheduled to take place throughout 1997 and 1998.	0
Project involvement has been at the request, and with the cooperation of, government authorities, indigenous and tribal peoples and their organizations, non-governmental actors and United Nations agencies.	0
This is meant to contribute to the formulation of a draft policy outlining an EIA which is friendly to indigenous communities and which takes into account their characteristics, and specific needs and rights.	0
Modules for the training of trainers have been developed and are being tested in a number of indigenous communities.	0
Community-based revolving funds and innovative approaches making extensive use of indigenous knowledge have been developed in the field of lift irrigation cooperatives, plant nurseries to generate forests, biogas plants and diary schemes.	0
35. In the context of the procedure for the adoption of new international labour standards on child labour, the Office sent to Governments and employers' and workers' organizations a preliminary report outlining legislation and practice in the various countries, and also a questionnaire relating to the possible content of future instruments.	0
Collaboration with other international organizations	0
This has taken place so far through technical discussions between the staff of the two organizations, with the objective of coming to a better working arrangement.	0
And I've met with some of these people. 	1
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah. 	1
Each one was more beautiful than the other. 	1
And the guy looked at me and said, "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?" 	1
2. The Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General:	0
(b) To submit a report on the information gathered to the Sub—Commission at its forty-ninth session, together with any recommendations and views which he may have received on effective ways and means of eliminating such weapons.	0
5. A reply was also received from the Centre for Disarmament Affairs of the United Nations.	0
6. International Educational Development, Inc. (IEDI) and the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) also sent replies.	0
Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. 	1
However, Nigeria is still faced with the threats of wastes illegally dumped in the country.	0
Its studies trace several years of negative effects of the use or accidental release of chemical and biological (bacteriological) substances for public health, as well as for the environment.	0
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. 	1
18. The first widely-supported declarations prohibiting weaponry date from the time of the first Hague Conference in 1899 and prohibit projectiles launched from balloons (Declaration IV,1 of 1899), projectiles diffusing asphyxiating gases (Declaration IV,2) and “dum-dum” bullets (Declaration IV,3).	0
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. 	1
The main issue in these declarations was to prohibit weaponry causing “needless” suffering.	0
George Bernard Shaw said it differently. 	1
And indeed, that's what we do.  And then you just focus on this person. 	1
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out." 	1
Nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium (hereinafter referred to as DU) are all fundamentally indiscriminate and uncontainable, have severe residual effects long after the war is over, cause undue suffering and harm the environment.	0
The other main characteristic is motivation. 	1
The use in the definition of the words “any act” means that use of weapons could be an act of torture to the degree that the rest of the definition is met. Legal weapons used in legal military operations against legal military targets would not meet the rest of the test for torture: humanitarian law permits the use of weapons and military operations that are not specifically prohibited and would therefore be subject to the “lawful sanctions” exclusion in the definition.	0
29. The most obvious risk of violation of human rights by the development, production and storage of nuclear (including depleted uranium), biological, bacteriological or chemical weapons is because of the almost certain contamination of people, animals, plants, ground, air and water.	0
And indeed, that's exactly what happens. 	1
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. 	1
and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education. 	1
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new. 	1
One of the great dilemmas in weaponry and weapons development is the secrecy with which such issues are treated by Governments.	0
where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism. 	1
We sit around it and it shapes our minds. 	1
There are also relocation-related and poverty—related illnesses and illnesses of the Earth, such as the sinking and cracking of atolls, tidal waves and other environmental changes.	0
47. The peoples of the Marshall Islands also are experiencing many of the consequences of such tests, including the loss of traditional islands.	0
48. IITC also cites the United States Government's use of indigenous peoples in Alaska as “guinea pigs”, in human radiation testing, in tests called “Project Chariot”, whereby large quantities of nuclear waste from the Nevada, Shoshone territory, atomic bomb test site were buried near the indigenous Inupiat village of Point Hope, Alaska, in order to test the dispersal of radioactivity in an Arctic climate directly on indigenous peoples.	0
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills. 	1
49. On 8 September 1996, the Indigenous Anti-Nuclear Summit Declaration was adopted at a gathering of indigenous peoples, their representatives and organizations, at Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America.	0
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?" 	1
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable. 	1
“(2) Replies in the following manner to the question put by the General Assembly:	0
I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story. 	1
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. 	1

And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm. 	1
ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ABOVE ALL THE RIGHT TO LIFE	0
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike. 	1
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know? 	1
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems. 	1
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him. 	1
And they were all at a conference in Beijing. 	1
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner. 	1
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing. 	1
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles. 	1
(b) As provided for by the Convention, once the period established for the destruction of chemical weapons has expired, no State party may be allowed to store such weapons;	0
8. The reaffirmation contained in the Final Document of the Fourth Review Conference is of special importance to Cuba, in that the use by States parties, in any way and under any circumstances, of microbial or other biological agents or toxins that is not consistent with prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes, is effectively a violation of article I of the Convention.	0
We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature. 	1
11. As Mr. M. Dubey, former Foreign Secretary of India, wrote (“The Only Alternative is the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons”, Disarmament, vol. XVII, No. 2/1994), a new security system should be genuinely multilateral, at both the regional and global levels, and the United Nations should be the centrepiece of that architecture.	0
Such a system should also be capable of dealing with both military and non-military aspects of security, including the establishment of an equitable and just international economic order.	0
8. Thus, in the post—cold war era, the strategic defence initiative or “minimum deterrence” approach has been replaced by alternatives, looking at security in a comprehensive sense.	0
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve. 	1
This is hardly surprising, given the fact that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights clearly established that “[t]he acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its form and manifestations as well as linkage in some countries to drug trafficking are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening territorial integrity, security of States and destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments” (Part I, para. 17), and prompted the international community to take the necessary steps to prevent and combat terrorism.	0
(f) The resolutions on “Human rights and terrorism” adopted recently by the General Assembly (48/122, 49/185 and 50/186) show not only the broadening of its interest in the particular relationship that exists between human rights and terrorism but also a certain evolution of its attitude towards terrorist acts committed by non—State actors.	0
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process. 	1
Yet, in considering the human rights dimension of terrorism, it is not only the number of its victims that should be taken into account but also the impact it has on its victims, the society and the State.	0
Killing innocent people, destroying property, and fostering an atmosphere of alarm and terror amount not merely to a violation of the rights of the victims but to a solicitation of further serious breaches of human rights; in fact, by reason of the terrorists' despicable conduct and the threat posed to society, the authorities of the State which is responsible for bringing the terrorist violence to an end are entitled to respond with counter—terrorist measures and may not be constrained by the normal limits of official measures for the prevention of ordinary crime.	0
In this age of increasing internationalization and interdependence, the national and international dimensions of terrorism are but two facets of the same dangerous social phenomenon which infringes upon the interests of all States, not only as an assault against their public order and the institutions that protect the liberty and security of their citizens but, at the same time, as a serious danger to peaceful international relations and cooperation, which in our day is clearly understood as encompassing human rights and values, as well as the principle of equal rights and self—determination of peoples.	0
We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way -- he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO2 -- how plant-like. 	1
15. Very little can be said at the present stage about the concept of human rights and the definition of international terrorism, which will both require very careful consideration in the framework of a possible Sub—Commission study that would need to deal, inter alia, with the actors involved in the violation of human rights and humanitarian law through acts of terrorism, and the identification of the situations in which acts of terrorism may or may not violate human rights.	0
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building. 	1
The whole movement for the protection of human rights arose as an attempt to redress the balance between the power of the State to impose duties on individuals and the powerlessness of the individuals to ensure correlative respect for their rights.	0
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies. 	1
II. METHODOLOGICAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE FUTURE WORK OF THE SUB—COMMISSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS	0
19. In this connection, and in view of the complexity and diversity of the issues involved, the Sub—Commission could be advised to identify — at least at the beginning — priority areas or priority topics, and decide as well how far it would wish to go in the analysis of other issues.	0
Finally, other issues which are either inadequately or not at all reflected in this working paper, such as the connection between terrorist groups and transnational organized crime, or the growth in the post—cold war era of terrorist activity by ethnic and national minorities, could also be addressed as appropriate.	0
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself. 	1
Learning from organisms. This is a session about water -- in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration. 	1
Expanded working paper submitted by Mr. Stanislav Chernichenko	0
II. INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS	0
6. The Commission at its fifty—first session, in decision 1995/111, requested the Sub-Commission, bearing in mind the work of the other United Nations bodies on the issue, to reconsider its recommendation to appoint a Special Rapporteur to prepare a report on the recognition of gross and large—scale violations of human rights, perpetrated on the orders of Governments or sanctioned by them, as an international crime.	0
7. The Sub-Commission, at its forty—seventh session, in resolution 1995/22, taking into account Commission decision 1995/111, reaffirmed its recommendation that the Commission appoint Mr. Chernichenko as special rapporteur.	0
We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden. 	1
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life. 	1
In the final analysis, gross and massive violations of human rights in any part of the world are a threat to mankind in general.	0
Their elimination or prevention depends on the efforts of the international community.	0
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did. 	1
It would also offer the possibility in future of defining it in more specific terms, gradually creating a conventional basis for regulating these questions in greater detail.	0
12. A number of comments and recommendations which, in the view of the author of this paper, merit special attention were made during the discussion of working paper E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/10 by the Sub—Commission.	0
But I was interested in another definition of technology. 	1
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene. 	1
He will therefore endeavour to refrain as much as possible from referring to examples that might lead to the politicization of the present working paper.	0
This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet. 	1
15. The division of violations of international law into international crimes and other breaches of international law arose after the Second World War.	0
International crimes are the most serious violations of international law, causing loss or constituting a threat to the entire international community.	0
International crimes constitute breaches of an obligation erga omnes, that is, they provide grounds for calling the offending State to account not only to any State which has suffered directly but to any other State.	0
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon, and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy. 	1
“(a) A serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the maintenance of international peace and security, such as that prohibiting aggression;	0
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized. 	1
18. Several points connected with the concept of international crimes have given rise to disputes which are still continuing.	0
It would also be undesirable to embark upon a more detailed discussion of them since that might divert attention from the central problem.	0
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution. 	1
And again, my question is, what does technology want? 	1
At the present time, for example, so—called “ethnic cleansing” policies could be included among international crimes.	0
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII, had only about 7,000 items in his household. 	1
19. Apart from the term “international crime”, the expressions “crimes against international law”, “crimes under international law” and “crimes of an international nature” have gained wide currency.	0
The expression “crimes against international law” was used in the judgement of the Nürnberg Tribunal, which stated that “Crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities ...”.	0
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium. 	1
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample. 	1
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out. 	1
In their view, individuals cannot directly violate the norms of international law since such norms are established not for them but for States and certain other entities capable of participating in relations between States, such as peoples and nations whose statehood is being established, independent cities and intergovernmental organizations.	0
C. Relationship between international crimes and crimes against international law	0
27. Whatever theory of the relationship between international and domestic law one favours, it would be logical to introduce some terminological exactitude into the question of what constitutes international crimes and crimes against international law.	0
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences. 	1
Also similar is the list of crimes in the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, established by Security Council resolution 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994.	0
29. Crimes against international law are not necessarily associated with international crimes.	0
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. 	1
There are, of course, instances when crimes against international law are always or nearly always associated with an international crime.	0
The same acts may be regarded from several different viewpoints.	0
This is many years ago, back in the early 70s. 	1
Thus it may be said that international crimes are always associated with crimes against international law, but crimes against international law are not necessarily associated with international crimes.	0
They think, "Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy." 	1
Traditionally, it has been possible for individual cases to be considered at the international level if the State concerned has given its assent.	0
And he would think it through and say, "What was wrong? 	1
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him. 	1
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. 	1
37. Finding the dividing line between the various categories of violations is fairly difficult because, all in all, the attempt to formulate criteria by which to assign such violations to one or another category has not been successful.	0
They only indicate the nature of such violations.	0
And finally, he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him, and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle." 	1
Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 27 May 1970 twice (in paras. 1 and 5) mentions “a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms”.	0
Then the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup. 	1
In the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this. 	1
In fact, they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego. 	1
Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce. 	1
It is beyond doubt, however, that draft article 19, and paragraph 3 (c) in particular, is based to some extent on practice.	0
Article I of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide states:	0
According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you. 	1
At first sight, it would appear that the contracting parties had decided to regard only acts by individuals (official and private) as criminal (i.e. crimes against international law).	0
Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika. That was mustard. 	1
They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it, made it look French, even though it's made in Oxnard, California. 	1
Another pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?" 	1
Work on the draft articles on State responsibility and the draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind is advancing extremely slowly, and the former obviously deals only with the responsibility of States, while those articles of the latter which were adopted on first reading deal only with the criminal responsibility of individuals.	0
It is couched in terms too vague even for a general principle.	0
Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. 	1
What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, "This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce." 	1
That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz: that in embracing the diversity of human beings, we will find a surer way to true happiness. 	1
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband. 	1
The responsibility of States under international law in these cases is rather vague and even, in some cases, symbolic, and the task of determining the responsibility of individuals participating in the acts constituting a breach of international obligations is usually left up to the violating State.	0
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns. 	1
These principles must of course also be defined in more specific terms, and it is assumed that this will be done in the legislation adopted by States.	0
A State which fails to recognize any obviously gross violations of human rights as crimes runs the risk of being accused of creating conditions conducive to their perpetration.	0
The problem is the lack of a list of gross violations of human rights.	0
However, this idea has not gained a great deal of support.	0
And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -- I said, "I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet." 	1
It would appear that recognition of an organization as being criminal implies that it incurs criminal responsibility.	0
And I said, "I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award." 	1
I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, And I said to my husband, "Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No." And my husband --  this is my husband, who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot. 	1
And those people who know me understood my joke -- this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people. 	1
It would be more correct to talk of a State that committed an international crime or crimes.	0
But I got emails from people that said, "Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole. 	1
 I was like, "OK, what? Who are these people? 	1
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people. 	1
It would be rather pointless to try to decide what procedure should be used to demonstrate that the act in question was committed and that it was committed by a certain person, and what procedure should be adopted to hold that person responsible, if it has not been decided how that act should be treated from a legal standpoint.	0
Yet it can be partially solved and is indeed being solved at the present time: in certain completely obvious cases there is no need to establish any special procedures or machinery to determine that gross and massive violations of human rights have taken place.	0
but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is who I am. 	1
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories, and then you have this. 	1
However, the main ways in which this may be done can already be described.	0
It can also be realized by various ways and means in accordance with existing international law.	0
In the first two cases, responsibility is realized above all through the national courts and in the last case through an international court.	0
“The principle of international law which, under certain circumstances, protects the representatives of a State, cannot be applied to acts which are condemned as criminal by international law.	0
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today. 	1
This is confirmed by article 99 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949, which states: “No prisoner of war may be tried or sentenced for an act which is not forbidden by the law of the Detaining Power or by international law, in force at the time the said act was committed.”	0
It should also be borne in mind that reaching a consensus in drafting and approving a given declaration is often made easier by the fact that its terms are not legally binding.	0
So -- the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important. 	1
Recognizing the need and urgency of affirming in international law the principle that gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of Governments or sanctioned by them in any way are international crimes,	0

I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport, and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m., he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest, that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later, because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern, and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots, 	1
And, I think, if we look around the world, as well as the polar ice caps melting, human rights, which have been fought for, for many hundreds of years in some cases, are, also, eroding very fast, and that is something that we need to take a look at and, maybe, start campaigning for. 	1

1. The specialized knowledge of the various members of the Sub—Commission should be taken into account when appointing rapporteurs, due regard being had for equitable geographical distribution.	0
And we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that, because this music has been propertized. 	1
3. Such an appointment should in no way limit the right of any member of the Sub—Commission to comment, at any time under the agenda item being discussed, on the report submitted for consideration.	0

2. In drafting this expanded working paper, the author has made reference not only to the numerous writings of jurists, political scientists and sociologists cited in the bibliography, but also to the reports and resolutions of United Nations agencies and international conferences and congresses on the consolidation of democracy, and in particular new or restored democracies.	0
But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. 	1
This is a huge task whose scale, impact and implications mean that it cannot be performed without active support from the Sub—Commission and the Commission on Human Rights, as well as from the international community.	0
This artificially induced consumerism -- I think it's atrocious. 	1
14. It follows from the foregoing that the issue of who governs and how he is chosen is of secondary importance since government activity as a whole is controlled by laws and regulations designed to restrict as far as possible any attempts to divert authority for personal ends and possible abuse of office, in order to direct action towards the attainment of the public good and the general welfare.	0
This very freedom is the foundation, but also the purpose, of any democratic society.	0
So we go, we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. 	1
The principle of equality before the law must be publicized and explained to all citizens from early childhood, and any discriminatory treatment must be justified on grounds that are specific, recognizable and accepted by all.	0
When I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself. 	1
This means that institutions for dialogue will have to be established and those that exist preserved and reformed in the light of the needs expressed and objectives pursued.	0
Each bottle is different, meaning the water level will give you a different shape. 	1
It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. 	1
It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. 	1
28. It might seem impossible to promote a democratic society without taking into consideration its fundamental elements, namely the citizen and the various groups, trade unions, clubs and political parties, as it is within these associations that the individual is able effectively to develop his abilities and defend or put forward his views on the affairs of society and its problems.	0
Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. 	1
32. That having been said, for individuals to be able to fulfil themselves by using their abilities, freedom must be hedged by certain conditions, the first of which is ownership of property, ownership not only of the means of production, but any property, the fruit of the work of the individual or of his family and the instrument which enables him to act, progress, defend and protect himself, and contribute to expressions of solidarity with other citizens.	0
34. If there are economic, social and cultural rights for the benefit and at the disposal of the individual, they must not be merely rhetorical but must take on a substance that necessarily entails duties, but for whom?	0

2. In its resolution 1997/22, entitled “Work of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities”, the Commission on Human Rights expressed its appreciation of the steps undertaken by the Sub—Commission to reform and improve its methods of work, in particular “... the decision to avoid duplication with the work of the Commission on Human GE.97—12702 (E) page Rights by not taking action during its forty—ninth session on human rights situations under consideration in the public procedures of the Commission (decision 1996/115)” and requested the Sub-Commission “to refrain henceforth from duplicating action by the Commission on Human Rights with regard to country situations under consideration in the public procedures of the Commission and, furthermore, limit action to exceptional cases in which new and particularly grave circumstances arise”.	0

Under the influence of his success, his illusions, his passions or his inflated pride, man is capable of taking an irreparable step, destroying his life and his very existence with the very science and technology he himself invented.	0
The solution would be to surround scientific research with legal and material safeguards, while respecting scientists' rights to freedom and dignity.	0
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: "Is it remarkable?" 	1
10. These areas do not lend themselves easily to classification.	0
In recent years, some scientific advances have been misused, so that therapeutic techniques have been diverted to purposes which are not necessarily desirable.	0
It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly, it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris. 	1
And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread. 	1
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say, drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place, because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it. 	1

For this purpose, a support fund should be created for the benefit of research in the third world.	0

This is a very dangerous job, being in a gang. 	1
So -- I kid you not -- the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was: "How do you feel about being poor and Black in America?" 	1
 So the choice of answers were: [A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad] What Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following:  The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook. 	1
There was a lot of gunfire, there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members. 	1
But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir, who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. 	1
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang, 	1

Periodic reports on the implementation of the said instruments are now under preparation.	0
Our people will, therefore, not be subdued by any words or pressure of others.	0
So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually, at a place like McDonald's. 	1
Our withdrawal from these instruments might be another pretext for the forces hostile to us to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but for our part, it will be rather convenient not to be bound by these instruments.	0
And so the death rate -- not to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded -- the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. 	1
That gives you some pause, for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime. 	1
And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. 	1

1. The Commission on Human Rights, at its fifty-first session, in its resolution 1995/29 of 24 August 1995, requested the Secretary-General to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced eviction and the relationship of this practice to internationally recognized human rights with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement.	0
Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children. 	1
4. Overview of the issue of forced evictions and development-based displacement and relevant human rights standards affected	0
RIGHTS GUIDELINES ON DEVELOPMENT-BASED DISPLACEMENT	0
And the people were happy. They were satisfied. 	1
For many years this went along, and everything was fine. 	1
Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1996/290, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/77 and Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities resolution 1996/27,	0
Conscious that forced evictions intensify social conflict and inequality and invariably affect the poorest, most socially and economically vulnerable sectors of society, specifically women, children and indigenous peoples,	0
And the parents were very unhappy, and they said, "This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset. 	1
So the yellow bar represents car seats, the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts. 	1
12. States should ensure that eviction impact assessments are carried out prior to the initiation of any project which could result in development-based displacement, with a view to fully securing the human rights of all potentially affected persons, groups and communities. The obligation to prevent homelessness	0
The home and its occupants shall further be protected against any arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy or respect of the home.	0
And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking -- we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?" 	1
So they just have these bench seats, and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it. 	1
24. All persons subjected to any forced eviction not in full accordance with the present Guidelines should have a right to compensation for any losses of land or personal, real or other property or goods, including rights or interests in property not recognized in national legislation, incurred in connection with a forced eviction.	0
Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500 out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something. 	1
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat. 	1
That's some more evidence, so in some sense -- I was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publish a study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes. 	1
And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there, that's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working. 	1
A. Prevention of violations of economic, social and cultural rights 119 — 126 29	0
And it turned out that never, in all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill, did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness. 	1
3. On 26 August 1993, in its resolution 1993/37, the Sub—Commission welcomed the preliminary report — and not interim report, as it was erroneously entitled — (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/6) prepared jointly by Mr. Guissé and Mr. Joinet and requested them to submit a report, including conclusions and recommendations, on the first aspect of the question of impunity, relating to civil and political rights, at its forty—sixth session (1994), and to continue their study on the second aspect of the question, concerning economic, social and cultural rights.	0
Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury? Because that would prove your case.) Steven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes, I find very small differences in injury. 	1
Thom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously, and he's going, I hope you're not next. 	1
And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations, of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations, the naysayers. 	1
Whereas, in the case of civil and political rights, the State must stand aside so as to allow the individual to exercise those rights without interference, economic, social and cultural rights require the State to act and give the individual the material support needed to enjoy them effectively.	0
9. This characteristic, which arises from their modes of implementation, in no way impairs the indivisibility of the various human rights, as affirmed by several international instruments.	0
10. The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization, promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights.	0
It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line, not the straight line. 	1
A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago, which was the modeling of a hippocampus -- the territory of the brain that records short-term memory -- and the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience. 	1
21. To be complete and effective, the campaign against impunity must be preceded by a serious and thorough investigation to bring to light the factual sources of the violations and identify the perpetrators and the victims so that the former can be punished and the damage done to the latter can be appropriately remedied.	0
22. The campaign against impunity should focus on the absence of penalties or compensation and the inadequacy of penalties or compensation already in existence or contemplated.	0
And the project -- again, enormous, enormous competition -- on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes. 	1
(e) The Declaration on Social Progress and Development (General Assembly resolution 2542 (XXIV));	0
And so I can start this discussion in any number of places, and I've chosen three or four to talk about. 	1
It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous, and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. 	1
And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself. 	1
(b) The second point relates to the consequences of such practices for economic, social and cultural rights and for collective rights; and	0
We're using light as a building material in this case. 	1
This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction. 	1

Impunity for these crimes denies human beings any possibility of living in a world based on justice, peace, freedom and democracy.	0
The actions engaging the international responsibility of a State are the same as those giving rise to individual criminal liability in the case of persons who, whether as groups or as private individuals, commit actions constituting an offence.	0
African history in the period of slavery is marked by a series of crimes and all manner of violations of the rights of the human person which are beginning to be recognized but which have never formed the subject of any redress, while the Powers formerly responsible for this traffic continue to profit from it.	0
and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green. 	1
We put one piece directly north-south, and it holds the dishes at the ears, right? 	1
and other parts are much more energetic and intense. 	1
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground, and it becomes part of the idea. 	1
44. Colonization entailed the destruction and modification of the structures of the colonized peoples.	0
The international community, through its deliberative body of the period - the General Assembly of the League of Nations - which was dominated by the Western countries, had authorized those countries to divide up the third world and form colonial empires.	0
45. Slavery and colonization ended up by ruining the entire third world which, moreover, has never recovered.	0
And finally, one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse. 	1
48. A tragic vestige of colonial domination, apartheid in many ways recalls slavery.	0
Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right? 	1
The “whites”, who represented 20 per cent of the population, had control over and use of 80 per cent of the territory, whereas the “blacks”, who represented 70 per cent of the population, controlled only 13 per cent of the lands.	0
Even today, survivals of the system continue to produce victims.	0
The principle in such cases is that, so long as the nefarious action has not ceased, there can be no prescription, the more so as these are crimes against humanity which are thus imprescriptible and subject to the principle of universal jurisdiction.	0
You didn't trust information very much. 	1
That led me to another step of why I'm here today, is because I really liked media of all kinds. 	1
Debt and debt-servicing are steadily impoverishing the peoples concerned more and more every day, systematically preventing them from exercising their basic rights.	0
58. It will be recalled that, in 1944, the Bretton Woods Conference decided to set up the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the purpose of helping to improve world trade relations.	0
The main victims are, of course, the deprived segments of society who have less to live on, and nothing seems able to halt their slide towards absolute poverty.	0
The rocking podium.  This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker.  Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks, that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee; the coffee was actually pre-Columbian. 	1
Moreover, there is also every indication that the perpetuation of indebtedness means that it can be used as a powerful weapon to bring developing countries to their knees, while providing their governing classes with the means to cushion themselves and to be the advocates — I was going to say the architects — of an economic policy which is catastrophic for the vast majority of the world's poor.	0
The resources will not be new ones but rather a reorientation of resources already existing at the national and international levels.	0
The Bank proposes, in the first instance, to establish a ceiling for debt-servicing which should not exceed 20 to 25 per cent of the export earnings of the country concerned.	0
We all remember the promises made in the context of the structural adjustment programmes which very rapidly turned into a resounding failure in all the countries that applied them.	0
The measures adopted in the context of structural adjustment programmes have culminated in a downward revision of exchange rates which reduces the purchasing power of the workers and have caused inflation which is intolerable for the less favoured segments of the population.	0
Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points, like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves. 	1
But another layer of representation was still introduced. 	1
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes, so chocolate is very good, because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance. 	1
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system.	0
But once they're applied to numeric structure, then you can feel more comfortable. 	1
The same is true in the countries with economies in transition.	0
Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today, which is the bit map. 	1
In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place, trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience. 	1
78. The advent of modern society has endowed money with three separate functions which often make it the catalyst for the phenomenon of corruption, since money has no bounds, can be transferred unobtrusively from one person to another and can be used for any transactions by virtue of its abstract nature.	0
Organized and applied on a large scale, these offences cause immeasurable damage to larger and larger social strata.	0
Since they are the main sources of revenue of the developing countries, they play a significant part in the overall development effort.	0
They have led in the past, and continue to lead, to serious and massive violations of these rights and even to their being completely disregarded by those who are responsible for and benefit from them.	0
 And they say, "Will you build it in my district?" 	1
Such establishments have usually proved to be unstable because the parent company can decide, for commercial, economic or political reasons, to move its subsidiaries to other countries.	0
A balanced ecosystem, preservation of natural resources or simply the survival of the planet are urgent requirements which have to be met if our system is not to be destroyed.	0
93. According to a report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the conservation of biological diversity is fundamental to human life.	0
Problem is, the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you. 	1
This is not about projecting power, but about staying power, which is about legitimacy with the locals. 	1
96. The scandals of 1987 and 1988 which followed the discovery of deals whereby African countries received derisory sums of money from western companies in return for the use of land for the dumping and burial of toxic waste, brought a justifiably violent reaction from some developing countries.	0
It is in that context that the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) declared in its resolution 1153 (XLVIII) of 25 May 1988 that such dumping was a crime against Africa and the African people.	0
There is no doubt that those rights rest on the most important right of all, namely, the right to life.	0
The explanations provided by the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO) are far from satisfactory, especially when he states that African countries should undertake major reforms.	0
They got out on the far end, we said, "Fine, don't worry about it." 	1
For a very large part of the population, health care is inaccessible because of its cost.	0
This situation puts the minimum needed for health beyond the reach of the most disadvantaged segments of society, namely, workers and their families, children, women and the elderly.	0
The international community should be more involved and cooperate more with States, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.	0
They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you, and then say in no uncertain terms, "Please cut that out." 	1
It is a well-known fact that 20 per cent of the world's population controls 80 per cent of the world's resources and technological benefits.	0
A functioning executive that will translate will into action, because we don't have it. 	1
Realization of the right must thus take into account the cultural and social elements of the people concerned.	0
In any case, it should be recalled that the public authorities themselves very often embark on the nationalization or expropriation of settled lands without providing any compensation to those affected.	0
111. The right to education is increasingly difficult or even impossible to realize in many countries, especially in the third world.	0
They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. 	1
I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. 	1
I'm talking about regularizing it, making it transparent. 	1
C. Violations of the economic, social and cultural rights of vulnerable groups	0
114. The so-called vulnerable groups, which include children, women, migrant workers, the old and the poor, are undeniably the most exposed to and the most seriously affected by massive human rights violations.	0
115. In some developed countries, particularly in Europe, restructuring and economic policies should be expressly aimed at improving the fate of deprived fringe groups such as invalids, migrants and the members of ethnic minorities, while ensuring a full participation by these groups in the economic, political and social life of the nation.	0
This obligation, for which the States and the international community are responsible, has often been and may long continue to be ignored in view of the lack of will on all sides.	0
They spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap. 	1
Going back to the beginning of our country -- historically, defenses meant protection of the homeland. 	1
To attack America is to risk blowing up the world. 	1
They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes. 	1
 The Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure. 	1
There are thus two types of responsibility, national and international.	0
Thus, the international responsibility of a subject of law can be invoked only when no domestic remedy is available or if domestic remedies have been exhausted or are inadequate.	0
The responsibility of the international community is great with regard to these economic policies favouring the developed countries which widen daily the gap between rich and poor countries.	0
The maintenance of the existing economic order with these injustices and its failure to adapt to today's economic realities, rectification of which has been constantly demanded but in vain, is also a responsibility of the international community.	0
The juridical acts that give rise to obligations entailing the responsibility of a subject of law (an individual or a State) are specified by law.	0
Economic, social and cultural rights are generally connected with an economic activity and it is in this framework that they are most often violated.	0
The State cannot invoke either its own legislation or the incompetence or disobedience of its agents to exonerate it from its responsibility, whether the actions in question are government ones or purely managerial.	0
The implementation of such responsibilities requires a certain amount of cooperation between States and the international community.	0
Leviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services. 	1
And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed. 	1
Gender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children. 	1
Another, broader, approach is to understand by victim anyone who can prove that he has suffered harm or has an interest in taking action.	0
“The State has a legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent human rights violations and to use the means at its disposal to carry out a serious investigation of violations committed within its jurisdiction, to identify those responsible, to impose the appropriate punishment and to ensure the victim adequate compensation.”	0
This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. 	1
 And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk. 	1
 I don't want my Marines handing out aid. 	1
Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force, you can win by bombing. 	1
(e) More elaborate standards could be proposed to States to combat impunity in cases of corruption, misappropriation of public or private funds, abuse of trust by public officials, and tax and customs fraud and, lastly, efforts to combat them could be strengthened and greater consideration given to the harm suffered by the victims, whether States or individuals; and	0
They said, "Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff." 	1
A fact came out of MIT, couple of years ago. Ken Hale, who's a linguist, said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now, 3,000 aren't spoken by the children. 	1
G. "Top down" globalization and "bottom up" globalization 42 - 44 23	0
So, two months later, I went into Tibet, and I started interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do. 	1
This has been the core of debate in the three years of this Special Rapporteur's work on the relationship between human rights and income distribution at both international and national levels.	0
And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. 	1
And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. 	1
when I do these, because I'm setting up lights, and checking my lights, and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent. 	1
It should also be recalled that the General Conference of the International Labour Organization adopted, at its thirty-fourth session, Convention No. 100 concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value.	0
And if you think about this man, 46 years later, still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue. And the young people, young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work. 	1
Likewise, the Declaration on the Right to Development provides, in its article 3, that States have the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development and that States have the duty to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development.	0
As requested, Mr. Eide submitted his document (E/CN.4/Sub/1994/21) at the forty-sixth session of the Sub-Commission in 1994.	0
And we never hear about that. And the latest infraction against these people is, as part of Plan Colombia, we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is -- we're defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs. 	1
The first report also contained the guidelines for the future work: (a) analysis of the various forms of economic, political, social and cultural discrimination; (b) analysis of the causes of the gap between rich and poor countries in relation to income distribution; (c) the development of indicators enabling a more detailed analysis of income distribution at the national level; and (d) the search for means of determining how most effectively to strengthen activities in respect of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights.	0
It was a tool for monitoring the fulfilment of human rights.	0
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. 	1
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn. 	1
"...In the sphere of international cooperation, there is a need for the clearer application of the concept of 'equal opportunities'.	0
This is Daniel; he's one of our students in Arctic Village, Alaska. 	1
It is for this reason that a definition permitting a much more neutral and operational understanding of the concept has been adopted.	0
The rights of individuals established in codified human rights documents thus constitute the only general criterion for the establishment of minimum acceptable or unacceptable standards in economic and social matters at the national and international levels.	0
22. Income distribution in a society is directly related to existing levels of poverty.	0
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school --  -- because I was very small, and I was no good in sports, or anything like that. 	1
The advent of instantaneous communication both altered the nature of local experience and served to establish novel institutions.	0
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA. 	1
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule. 	1
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher, and I ended up in Cambridge, England. 	1
"There is the inescapable fact that the modern market economy accords wealth and distributes income in highly unequal, socially adverse and also functionally damaging fashion.	0
And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. 	1
This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile. 	1
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there, because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix, and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists. 	1
And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists, so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins. 	1
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix. 	1
The opening of the borders of countries living in a planned economy system and countries with protected economies has meant a substantial increase in room for manoeuvre by transnational companies and corporations with links with developing countries.	0
This is the case in Europe for the automobile industry.	0
The Thompson factory making RCA Victor televisions and other types of household appliances in the mid-west of the United States has said that it will be closing its factories from 1998 and setting up an assembly plant in Ciudad Juárez, in Mexico, because they could not compete with Mexican wage levels.	0
 And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure. 	1
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap. 	1
The uncontrolled expansion of neoliberalism is going to give rise to a new wave of controls.	0
Everywhere the new refrain is to be heard: "the corporations have to be controlled".	0
And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule: Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't. 	1
We weren't the best chemists in the room. 	1
This trend is being seen in almost all continents although it is still not possible to determine with certainty, as there are some countries that have attracted multinational capital with virtuous arguments and many others, at times the majority, that have attracted it with perverse arguments: the cheapness of labour, deregulation of labour markets and absence of environmental regulation.	0
There is, lamentably, a strong and dominant tendency for international capital to try to lodge itself in places where there are low wages, low conditions of social security, and low additional operating costs for businesses, in which levels of environmental protection are decisive.	0
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right." 	1
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing, and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions. 	1
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours. 	1
This is leading to very marked wage differentials depending on the type of enterprise and the technical demands of jobs. It involves less interference by the State in the control of working conditions, wages and social security for workers.	0
Most scientists are really rather dull. 	1
There are not a few cases in which workers are released to developing deregulated labour markets, arbitrary treatment at the hands of employment agencies, and in many cases a system of neo-slavery has developed in which workers have no protection whatsoever.	0
So think about it. The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in "Nature" -- none. 	1
Professor Anthony Guiddens writes: "Globalization invades local contexts of action but does not destroy them; on the contrary, new forms of cultural autonomy, demand for local cultural identity and self-expression are causally bound up with the globalization process".Guiddens, op. cit., p. 367.	0
Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow. 	1
Workers in the most diverse places in the world are understanding and comparing the working conditions at other latitudes.	0
So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money. 	1
This indicator permitted understanding of the growth of wealth and its distribution and is presented in Table 1 (see	0
This explains why their share has declined in a more than alarming manner, from 0.21 to 0.07%.	0
We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents. 	1
I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position to help parents who've had an autistic child, or think they may have an autistic child, and can we spot the difference? 	1
50. Studies on international cooperation point to the decrease in funds for the development of self-sustaining projects in the underdeveloped countries.	0
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure, and whether this is one that predisposes -- and then there's only a sub-segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic. 	1
Emergency solidarity is absolutely indispensable at certain times of crisis and uniquely dramatic situations and has to be valued, but there must also be insistence on the permanent needs for cooperation and collaboration by the developed countries with the third world.	0
Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow. 	1
The Copenhagen Conference or World Summit for Social Development did not succeed in signing up a commitment on this issue, leaving it to States to freely determine whether they wished to increase or decrease the volume of cooperation, the methodology to be applied, financial decisions on debt reduction and their response to other initiatives suggested to the participating States.	0
They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, the new urban world. 	1
The agreements on "globalization" that are now constantly being signed ought to include this dimension of economic relations.	0
The expansion of markets to the former planned and/or protected economy countries has meant an enormous stimulus to international trade.	0
57. The conclusion from the data presented here is that there is not one single trend in internal income distribution.	0
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad. 	1
1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services, no toilets, no rights. 	1
They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz. 	1
62. The distribution of knowledge gives us an indication of how the economic and social differences of today will be reproduced in future generations.	0
In 1992 the percentage of students of an age to study at universities (or colleges) in the poor countries was 2.78% in the poor countries, 11.29% in the middle income countries and 39.45% in the rich countries.	0
Lack of education at a relatively high level will in the near future become a basic impediment to the participation of that individual or group of people in the economic, social and cultural life of the contemporary world.	0
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door; he's got new tile on the roof. 	1
And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better. 	1
The philosopher Julien Freund remarks that: "It would appear that exclusion is now part of normality in societies, and does not arouse any special moral or political conscience but instead evokes pity in the guise of the virtue of charity".Xiberras, op. cit., Preface, p. 12.	0
He begins with an anecdote which runs roughly as follows. One summer, when they had nothing more interesting to do, the sub-editors at the London Times decided to see who could think of the most boring headline for the famous newspaper.	0
A framework is thus taking shape of "permanent and persistent violations" of the economic, social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world's population, threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights.	0
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built. 	1
Look carefully at the last column of the table.	0
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio. 	1
"The distribution of income in the modern economy derives ultimately from the distribution of power.	0
This is Richard Muthama Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera. 	1
It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. 	1
In nations apparently united, where the process of globalized economic growth without distribution is "demolishing" long-standing loyalties, the "integration mechanisms" laboriously built up are being torn apart.	0
So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. 	1
The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French -- all the Western-European languages are quite big. 	1
A part of the benefits deriving from economic growth should systematically be reinvested, both nationally and internationally, in human beings.	0
We could actually do without the employee. 	1
They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. 	1
What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. 	1
Such a document would allow a global evaluation of the activities of the Sub-Commission and facilitate planning future steps in this field.	0
95. The Social Forum could be held on three special days signalled in advance and announced in the programme of the annual session of the Sub-Commission with the active participation of all its members.	0
Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. 	1
That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. 	1
And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get email notifications of changes. 	1
Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software. 	1
The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. 	1
The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all. 	1
So somebody says, "Delete it, please. Delete it -- it's not notable." 	1
And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. 	1
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. 	1
(c) Traffic in human organs and tissues;	0
The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million, which is a reduction of 95 percent. 	1
(a) The concept of “indigenous peoples”.	0
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends, and track where technology would be at different points in time, and began to build the mathematical models of that. 	1
The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990. 	1
These are all logarithmic graphs, so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100. 	1
Now this is an interesting chart, and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes -- accelerate. 	1
So the first step in biological evolution, the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first -- took billions of years, but then evolution used that information-processing backbone to bring on the next stage. 	1
At its fourth session, in 1985, the Working Group under this item of its agenda decided that it should aim at producing as a first formal step a draft declaration on indigenous rights.	0
The Chairperson-Rapporteur was, once again, invited to revise the draft declaration on the basis of these comments and the written observations of Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and indigenous organizations for presentation at the ninth session of the Working Group.	0
And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements, what the key points are, there's differences of opinion when agriculture started, or how long the Cambrian Explosion took. 	1
And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth. 	1
The Working Group completed the second reading of the draft declaration and agreed upon a text (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/29, annex 1).	0
In its resolution 1993/46 of 26 August 1993, the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities decided to postpone until its forty-sixth session consideration of the draft declaration; it requested the Secretary-General to submit the draft declaration to the appropriate services within the Centre for Human Rights for technical revision; it also requested the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the draft declaration to indigenous peoples and organizations, Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.	0
Moore's Law was just the last part of that, where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit, but we had electro-mechanical calculators, relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code, vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower, discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law. 	1
In its resolution 1995/32 of 3 March 1995, the Commission decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council to establish an open-ended inter-sessional working group with the sole purpose of elaborating a draft declaration, considering the draft submitted by the Sub-Commission.	0
The second session of the working group of the Commission on Human Rights to review the “Draft United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples” was held from 21 October to 1 November 1996.	0
And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law for quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022. 	1
The working paper (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/1996/2) was available at the fourteenth session of the Working Group.	0
11. At its forty-eighth session, the Sub-Commission, in its resolution 1996/31 of 29 August 1996, requested the Chairperson-Rapporteur to prepare a supplementary note on the concept of “indigenous people”.	0
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. 	1
14. At its thirteenth session, the Working Group decided to include under this item of the agenda a sub-item on health and indigenous peoples.	0
A background paper prepared by the Secretary—General and information from other sources are contained in document E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/1997/3 and addenda.	0
And economists have actually started worrying about that. 	1
In its resolution 1987/17 of 2 September 1987, the Sub-Commission endorsed the recommendation and requested Mr. Alfonso Martínez to draft the general outline of such a study.	0
We had deflation during the Depression, but that was collapse of the money supply, collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena. 	1
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers. 	1
It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990, then a penny in 2000. 	1
In its resolution 1995/28 of 3 March 1995, the Commission decided upon a final programme of activities for the Decade for the year 1995.	0
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to, measured many different ways. 	1
The report of the second Technical Meeting (20-21 July 1995) is contained in document E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/1995/5.	0
The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions. 	1
The Assembly also recommended that the Commission on Human Rights, drawing on the results of the review, consider the convening of a second workshop.	0
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain, and in fact not surprisingly, the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. 	1
It turns out that we can understand it. 	1
You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust? 	1
Computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior, in terms of doing analytic thinking, remembering billions of facts accurately. 	1
These nano-bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications: cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment. 	1
(b) Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations.	0
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology. 	1
Mrs. Erica-Irene A. Daes, on the concept of “indigenous peoples”	0
If you really look at the power of exponential growth, you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. 	1
The Working Group discussed the concept of “indigenous peoples”, taking into account the views expressed by Governments, intergovernmental organizations, indigenous organizations and non-governmental organizations, and decided to continue its consideration of this matter at its fifteenth session.	0
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. 	1
The working definition pertaining to “indigenous peoples” in the report of Mr. José R. Martínez Cobo (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1986/7 and Add.1-4) was endorsed and said to be sufficient for identification of indigenous peoples.	0
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. 	1
1. In resolution 1982/34 of 7 May 1982, the Economic and Social Council authorized the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to establish annually a working group on indigenous populations to review developments pertaining to the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous populations, together with information requested annually by the Secretary-General, and to give special attention to the evolution of standards concerning the rights of indigenous populations.	0
Indigenous peoples' traditional concepts based on traditional knowledge and experience of subsistence use and conservation of lands and natural resources are therefore also essential in any attempts at rethinking the present resource demanding and environmentally damaging economic activities.	0
5. The effects of continually expanding requirements of urban societies are speeding up global economic activities.	0
However, Saami customary law is never applied if it is in contravention of national law.	0
Saami customary law and the Saami concept of law have been reflected in very limited scale in the law-making process.	0
Most of the land areas (90 per cent) within the demarcated Saami Homeland in Finland are regarded as State property.	0
15. The material basis for the Saami culture consists of the land and water in the Saami Homeland, which provide the natural resources for the pursuit of the traditional livelihoods of fishing, hunting, gathering and reindeer herding.	0
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet. 	1
The lands which the Saami had considered and used as their own since time immemorial were defined as “ownerless”, meaning that the State was the lawful owner.	0
However, the Saami right to ownership of their ancestral land was never recognized or denied by any formal legislative act after 1751.	0
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later. 	1
Before the establishment of the Soviet Union, the Saami divided the fishing waters between themselves according to the size of their communities.	0
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. 	1
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes. 	1
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies. 	1
There are disputes concerning the concept of private ownership: what are the exact rights and obligations of the owner versus other private parties and the authorities.	0
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy. 	1
42. The Saami filed a case which failed in the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court, inter alia because of legal technicalities. The complaint was declared inadmissible by the Commission on 25 November 1996 (Application No. 27033/95).	0
The engineering approach simply says, "Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic." 	1
43. Indigenous peoples in Suriname are presently without even the most rudimentary legal protections.	0
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. 	1
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete. 	1
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible." 	1
page great ethnic and cultural diversity among the world’s indigenous peoples, there seem to be common social and cultural denominators that affect the health situation of indigenous peoples.	0
 Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. 	1
 AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158. 	1
6. The general right to health is recognized in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	0
  Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. 	1
The Caucus also asked WHO to assist the Working Group in issues relating to the health of indigenous peoples, to conduct an international survey on the health of indigenous peoples and to promote respect for traditional medicine and practices.	0
13. In May 1977, the World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA30.43 in which it stated that the main social target of Governments and WHO in the coming decades should be the attainment by all citizens of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that would permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life.	0
If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation? 	1
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue. 	1
It aims to promote the health and well-being of indigenous peoples worldwide and acknowledges the basic rights and principles of indigenous peoples, including self-determination, and indigenous peoples' need to be involved at all levels of the design and implementation of the project.	0
The moon was closer; things were different. 	1
Article 25 also gives preference to community-based health services.	0
Growing living structures under an alien sky ... 	1
Life turned hard so it could venture inland. 	1
Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica. 	1
An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames. 	1
9. The general human rights situation in the respective regions/countries should be taken into consideration in the selection process.	0
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane. 	1
(b) Examining possible solutions to problems involving minorities, including the promotion of mutual understanding between and among minorities and Governments;	0
All the other TEDs -- and I went to them all, under Ricky's regime -- I talked about what the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it. 	1
(c) Recommending further measures, as appropriate, for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.	0
And the third is a little bit less obvious. 	1
Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now, or a book, or something. 	1
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert. 	1
And talk about where metaphors and reality mix -- this is the actual school. 	1
Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were -- let me say, apprehensive. 	1
They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings -- which nobody did and now almost everybody does -- drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation. 	1
It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. 	1
(e) The role of international financial institutions;	0
(f) The role of non-governmental organizations.	0
(f) The rights of minorities and the role of the media.	0
I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team. 	1
And the fun part -- and I'm quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser -- I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard. 	1
I've been using laptops since their inception. 	1
7. Measures taken by Governments to implement the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session.	0
Officers are elected for a one-year term.	0
And it's something that we didn't think was possible. 	1
Thus, in preparation for the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly, for which the Commission did not act as the preparatory body, the officers of the Preparatory Committee of the Whole served throughout the preparatory period and were then elected to perform the same functions as officers of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Seventeenth Special Session.	0
In the period from 26 to 27 March 1997, when it will act as the preparatory body for the special session of the General Assembly, the Commission will have a separate agenda and timetable.	0
The idea was that it would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform into an electronic book. 	1
It was also proposed that a number of issues could usefully be the subject of prior informal consultations.	0
Any additional comments arising during the briefings scheduled for 11 February and 5 March 1997 will be reported to the Commission at the organizational meeting.	0
(f) Establishment of the Committee on Draft Resolutions;	0
Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. 	1
If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed. 	1
And that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. 	1
Report of the Executive Director on the activities of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (E/CN.7/1997/2)	0
Because there's no market for post-office trucks. 	1
And everybody says -- I say -- it's an education project. 	1
Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real. 	1
To assist the Commission in its consideration of item 6, the Secretariat has prepared a report on the world situation with regard to illicit drug trafficking (E/CN.7/1997/4) and on the activities of its subsidiary bodies concerned with illicit trafficking, in particular the Ninth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa, held at Cairo from 16 to 20 June 1996, and the Twenty-first Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Asia and the Pacific, held at Manila from 4 to 8 November 1996 (E/CN.7/1997/4/Add.1) and the thirty-second session of the Subcommission on Illicit Drug Traffic and Related Matters in the Near and Middle East, to be held at Vienna from 17 to 21 February 1997 (E/CN.7/1997/4/Add.2).	0
The Secretary-General reports annually to the General Assembly on the implementation of the Global Programme of Action, and his latest report on the subject (A/51/436) will be made available to the Commission to assist it in carrying out its monitoring function.	0
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year. 	1
In even years, the Commission would consider implementation of its own resolutions and those of the Economic and Social Council.	0
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges. 	1
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them. 	1
At that same session, in considering the draft provisional agenda for its fortieth session, the Commission proposed the inclusion of an agenda item on the effects on individuals, society and international drug control of the prescription of narcotic drugs to drug addicts.	0
And we compare simulated universes like that -- I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky. 	1
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies. 	1
It contains a number of detailed recommendations on the budget methodology and the programme support cost arrangement.	0
Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality. 	1
And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars. 	1
4. The Committee of the Whole is scheduled to meet on Wednesday and Thursday, 19 and 20 March 1997, to consider the agenda items referred to in paragraph 2 above and on Friday, 21 March 1997, to review draft resolutions.	0
It was agreed that a small committee, composed of one member from each regional group, might be established to identify draft resolutions relating to the same agenda item. That would assist the Committee of the Whole in its work of reviewing and amending draft resolutions for consideration in plenary.	0
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein, who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein, the icon of poster and t-shirt, who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws. 	1
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell. 	1

The continental landmasses drifted around. 	1
A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years. 	1
The Fund was established by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/185 C, part XVI, of 20 December 1991, as from 1 January 1992, under the direct responsibility of the Executive Director of UNDCP, for financing operational activities mainly in developing countries.	0
Upon request, the Committee was informed that interest from special-purpose contributions is either refunded to the donor, earmarked for new project activities or credited to the general-purpose fund as agreed with the donor country.	0
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them. 	1
10. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was informed that cost-sharing contributions of $13,905,000 for 1996-1997 are expected from Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia.	0
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them. 	1
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently. 	1
So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. 	1
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro. 	1
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish. 	1
18. As indicated in paragraph 3, 25 and 29 of document E/CN.7/1997/9, the revised budget for 1996-1997, amounting to $141,235,100, reflects a decrease of $11,213,400 as compared to the initial budget of $152,448.500.	0
This is a picture in a Japanese subway. 	1
The Committee notes that the opening of the office in Cairo is preceded by the closing of the UNDCP office in Lebanon with effect from 31 December 1996.	0
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there. 	1
Upon request, the Committee was provided with a list of projects which have experienced serious delays in implementation, including a project in Brazil and another in Pakistan for which the total delay amounted to $4.4 million.	0
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another. 	1
29. In his report E/CN.7/1997/8, the Executive Director addresses issues relating to (i) programme support cost arrangements for the Fund of UNDCP; (ii) budget methodology, including a new budget concept, recosting methodology and performance reports; and (iii) promulgation of separate financial rules for UNDCP.	0
A number of detailed recommendations are presented in paragraphs 63-65.	0
They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different. 	1
And then use that information to fuel solutions? 	1
33. The Advisory Committee sees no usefully purpose in classifying the biennial budget of UNDCP in terms of "core" and programme support.	0
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win. 	1
Project activities would be approved by the Executive Director.	0
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards. 	1
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging. 	1
In the Committee's opinion, the experience of UNICEF in integrating administrative and support budgets and country and regional programmes should be consulted by UNDCP, in particular the recommendations of the firm of Booz-Allen and Hamilton on the subject (E/ICEF/1995/AB/L.1).	0
So far, most people who have lived have also died. 	1
The Advisory Committee has no objection to the promulgation of separate financial rules for the Fund of UNDCP, as shown in annex I of E/CN.7/1997/8, subject to the revision to take into account recommendations of the Advisory Committee in the present report.	0
So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 -- sorry, the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day, which is a huge number by any standard. 	1
Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big. 	1
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. 	1
Now, of course, this is an underestimation. 	1
Is responsible for planning, preparing, giving technical support to and following up evaluation activities carried out by the Programme.	0
Existential risk -- the second big problem. 	1
Responsible for administrative assistance to the Chief and other professional officers in the Laboratory Section for the internal and external expert group/consultative meetings.	0
The incumbent is also required to set up a system of cross referencing for the above.	0
It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage. 	1
The incumbent also provides inputs to the Programme on economic aspects of Alternative Development strategies.	0
The activities related to research encompass support to special programme events such as colloquia and presentation of technical papers as well as management of global research projects executed by TSB and those undertaken through UNDCP's field office initiatives. 17. Research Expert L3	0
And this is the answer -- we would have to change. 	1

Provides administrative and programme support to professionals in the Regional Section for Asia and the Pacific.	0
In close cooperation with the relevant technical units in TSB and other offices, is responsible for programme development activities in the sector of coordination of international drug control assistance to the countries of Eastern Europe, Baltic States and the CIS, which will lead to the formulation of a joint-inter-regional drug control assistance strategy between UNDCP and major donor countries.	0
Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later. 	1
Health span is a big and urgent thing, because if you're not alive, then all the other things will be to little avail. 	1

So then, you move off to this larger sphere of "human +," and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being. 	1
7. Provisional agenda for the forty-second session of the Commission and future work.	0
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- "I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!" 	1

And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time. 	1
7. If the reorganization of the work schedule proves feasible, the Commission would meet in the morning of 3 December, and would suspend its session until the afternoon of 4 December when it would conclude its consideration of agenda item 11 with the adoption of a resolution on the item and the adoption of its report.	0
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. 	1
According to that budget cycle, the Commission is called upon to approve the final budget for the current biennium and the initial budget for the next biennium for the Fund of UNDCP at its reconvened sessions, held in December of odd years.	0
And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition. 	1
C. Relationship between mandates and proposed activities 10-11 8	0
As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on. 	1
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe. 	1
What does a "typical" place in the universe look like? 	1
Implementation of the decision of the Commission to recast the entire budget of the Fund of UNDCP as a biennial support budget (management and administration and programme support) and a programme budget, together with the decision to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) relating to the regularization of project posts at headquarters, has resulted in a budget presentation somewhat at variance with the outline.	0
And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. 	1
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. 	1
That subprogramme itself contains three components: prevention and reduction of drug abuse; elimination of illicit crops; and suppression of illicit drug trafficking.	0
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs. 	1
At the moment, these things are fringe research; they're not central to the human effort to face this problem, or problems in general. 	1
Particular attention is paid to the development of cooperation between Governments, in line with the specific provisions of the conventions and through subregional cooperation arrangements to address shared problems.	0
This doesn't mean we should ignore software, or information, or computation." 	1
So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT. 	1
I spent six years thinking about that, but to show you the power of art over science -- this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called "HowToons." 	1
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta. 	1
In theory, if you program those sufficiently, you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure. 	1
Of the plant-based drugs, the illicit consumption of cannabis products is most widespread.	0
The most rapid rise in both abuse and manufacture in recent years has been that of synthetic drugs, particularly of amphetamine-type stimulants.	0
So, that's about three light switches lined up. 	1
What further affects countries in the entire world is the corruption, erosion of internal security, violence and economic and financial distortions associated with the production of and trafficking in drugs and with the legitimation of the proceeds of crime.	0
So, why would you want to replicate bit strings? 	1
Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. 	1
A summary assessment of the lessons learned and major achievements during the biennium 1996-1997 is highlighted in each of the eight programmes contained in the present document.	0
So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe, but I'll show you again. 	1
Of particular importance in that regard is the availability of general-purpose contributions for operational activities, which were severely lacking during the previous biennium, to allow a quick response to new challenges and opportunities.	0
Tables 1 to 10 provide comparisons between and within bienniums.	0
Volume changes reflect real increases and decreases in requirements, representing the controllable element in the budget estimates including changes in delivery of technical cooperation, outputs and services.	0
For 1998-1999, the increase of $5,585,800 for recosting reflects an increase of $8,364,700 for inflation adjustments and a decrease of $2,778,900 for exchange rate movements.	0
The activities aimed at the elimination of illicit crops will increase 34.6 per cent, from $20.3 million to $29.4 million.	0
One thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how, if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer, how do we make things in a very general sense, and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware? 	1
So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time, and unless Lisa Randall changes that, we'll continue to move in linear time. 	1
North Africa and the Middle East is a region in which the drug problem has not received adequate attention.	0
Programme activities planned are modest, given the fact that the UNDCP field office began work only in July 1997.	0
So I've been working on this a little, also, with a couple of other guys. 	1
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future. 	1
Accordingly, the resources allocated for the elimination of illicit crops under the programme for west and central Asia during the biennium 1998-1999 amount to $13.2 million, as compared with total expenditures in 1996-1997 of some $6.5 million.	0
And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. 	1
Increases in programming represent the high priority given to alternative development in Afghanistan and to controlling drug trafficking in the surrounding countries.	0
Architects are obsessed with authorship. 	1
First, cooperation under the subregional memorandum of understanding in south-east Asia will continue to provide the main touchstone for the work of UNDCP, with emphasis on development and implementation of projects flowing from the agreement.	0
They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. 	1
This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. 	1
We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach. 	1
Those developments have created a new dynamic situation in most African countries, which they seem to be poorly equipped to address.	0
And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict. 	1
 We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally. 	1
The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes. 	1
(c) Thirdly, the studies will invariably pave the way to ensuring that advocacy at the highest political level is sustained through participatory involvement of Government and civil society;	0
Only afterwards will it be possible to construct the building blocks of subregional cooperation.	0
They said, "Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be, based on the observations that we've done about the program." 	1
That was the main technology area in the building. 	1
The survey will target States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and SADC and be implemented by multidisciplinary expert groups.	0
It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum. 	1
I'm going to go very, very quickly through this. 	1
It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, "We need you to do a new building. 	1
Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company." 	1
And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall; they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth. 	1
To achieve this, both the dedicated drug units and laboratories will be better equipped in order to meet normative operational requirements.	0
And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from, between a series of forms and a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated. 	1
The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. 	1
During the peak years, some 5,000 hectares of opium poppy and 16,000 hectares of cannabis were cultivated, producing 3 to 5 tonnes of heroin and 545 to 1,000 tonnes of hashish annually.	0
Assistance to Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco will focus mainly on elimination of illicit crops.	0
UNDCP will only undertake the implementation of a small number of projects, such as subregional law enforcement projects, where national execution or participation of other international organizations is not considered to be an option.	0
It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. 	1
The main trends are increases in the abuse of amphetamines and hallucinogens, followed by cannabis, cocaine and opiates.	0
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong. 	1
Cultivation of poppy for household purposes is a tradition in the region and the ban on illicit poppy cultivation is generally not strictly enforced, although certain States have reported eradication measures, especially Hungary, which has experienced an increase in illicit cultivation in recent years.	0
A total of 13 projects were managed in central Europe, including those executed by United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations.	0
One hundred and twenty health professionals in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia attended training courses on substance abuse organized in their countries in 1996, and a core group of six experts from each country, who in 1994 had participated in the development of project-specific training curricula, received additional training.	0
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all. 	1
In 1997 a workshop was conducted to assist in the formulation of master plans.	0
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman. 	1
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects. 	1
 So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. 	1
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. 	1
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face. 	1
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view. 	1
True printed his own version of these signs. 	1

Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan, anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years, which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war, combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin.	0
Heroin abuse is on a sharp upward trend, having been brought into Afghanistan by refugees.	0
 And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority. 	1
There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here. 	1
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know, just to see what I actually like about my job. 	1
The opium poppy cultivation in the Dir district constitutes approximately 40 per cent of the total opium cultivation in Pakistan.	0
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it. 	1
Despite the chaotic political situation in Afghanistan related to the continuous civil strife, UNDCP is implementing a programme in the country mainly related to reduction of the poppy crop and capacity-building for drug control.	0
Following UNDCP legal advice, all central Asian States have become parties to the three United Nations drug control conventions.	0
At the end of the biennium, it is expected that the five central Asian States will have established harmonized and compatible responses on drug-control policies.	0
 And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil. 	1
Demand reduction standards related to epidemiological studies will have been set, and harmonization of statistical systems will have been undertaken.	0
By the end of the project period, it is expected that there will be no more opium production in the Dir district.	0
At the national level, controls at key road border crossings in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as well as airport interdiction capacities at Karachi, Pakistan, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and Ashghabad, Turkmenistan will be strengthened.	0
And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens. 	1
We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. 	1
And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel. 	1
In August 1995, UNDCP signed a memorandum of understanding with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).	0
And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan, of all the fuel energy you feed into the car, seven-eighths never gets to the wheels; it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon, the power train and accessories. 	1
The subregion will benefit from assistance provided under the global programme on money-laundering.	0
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. 	1
A monitoring and coordinating mechanism will be established with representation from the participating countries and UNDCP.	0
Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient. 	1
Although in the past there have been political differences between those countries, cooperation on drug-control issues has recently taken a firmer shape in light of the seriousness of the common threat to the stability of the region posed by illicit drugs and as a result of the improvements in political relations between countries and the efforts of UNDCP.	0
Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. 	1
And then another six can be made robustly, competitively, from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel, without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. 	1
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. 	1
Operational information will be exchanged more easily and on a regular basis.	0
Model treatment and rehabilitation methodologies will have been replicated and resulted in culturally appropriate drug-abuse prevention campaigns being in effect in all of the States parties to the memorandum of understanding.	0
This expands choice rapidly in the market, and actually makes more money for automakers as well. 	1
UNDCP, in collaboration with regional institutions, will continue to provide programmes for the training of trainers on addiction and rehabilitation covering east Asia and the Pacific, as well as countries in south and south-west Asia.	0
In the coming years, UNDCP will focus on strengthening its role as advocate, technical partner, coordinator and partial source of funding, placing emphasis on the monitoring of illicit cultivation and increasing community commitment.	0
Previously, intersectoral projects aimed at formulating coordinated national programmes and strengthening drug control institutions.	0
Many of the activities will be implemented by involving other United Nations agencies, utilizing their expertise and capacities: UNOPS as associated agency for, inter alia, alternative development projects; ILO for training in addiction rehabilitation; and ESCAP for community-based projects for the reduction of demand.	0
Multisectoral projects that include a component of drug-control legislation, as well as subregional law enforcement projects with legal training elements, will be closely linked to the UNDCP global legal advisory programme under which legal advisory services and legal training are provided.	0
In this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention, the economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent, oil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent. 	1
Mexico, Venezuela, Central America and the Caribbean will remain crucial transit areas for bulk shipments of cocaine destined for North America, Europe and other parts of the world.	0
There are no natural impediments to coca cultivation expanding significantly in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, and spreading to Ecuador, Guyana, Panama and Venezuela.	0
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. 	1
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. 	1
However, there are steep growth rates of drug abuse in the sprawling urban areas of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico and Venezuela.	0
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. 	1
OK. Good.  But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. 	1
During the biennium 1998-1999, CCM will be in a position to act as a clearing house for regional drug data, to organize periodic technical task-force meetings for design and monitoring of specific priority programmes, and generally to promote a more efficient allocation of internal and external technical assistance resources flowing into the region.	0
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. 	1
In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. 	1
It is essential to support, at national and international levels, the integration into alternative development of all relevant national and external resources under a multisectoral approach.	0
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. 	1
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. 	1
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. 	1
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. 	1
Equally important measures of success will be improved intergovernmental capacity to cooperate within and across borders to identify, investigate, prosecute and bring to sentence those who violate drug-control laws, as well as an increase in the number of cases resulting in the definitive forfeiture of the proceeds of criminal activities.	0
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up. 	1
CCM will also produce data on the status of and trends in drug trafficking and abuse in the Caribbean, as well as an inventory on current and prospective drug-control initiatives.	0
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. 	1
UNDCP also conducts ongoing monitoring and evaluation exercises, and participates in periodic meetings to adjust work plans, resolve problems and agree on the nature and scope of programme revisions.	0
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. 	1
Other operational activities will be executed directly by non-governmental organizations and inter-governmental organizations, with UNDCP performing the same substantive and programme monitoring functions described above.	0
Virtually all operational activities in the region are complemented by significant local cash and in-kind contributions which are channelled directly into programmes.	0
Another important area for work under the programme will be the promotion of international norms for the exchange of drug-related data and information and facilitating the exchange of such information among United Nations agencies and other international organizations and with Member States.	0
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. 	1
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. 	1
Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. 	1
UNDCP collaborated with UNICEF on a project for youth in crisis in 1997.	0
A total of $2.6 million was invested in developing model programmes in Egypt, Mexico, Namibia, Poland and Sri Lanka for 58 companies.	0
We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. 	1
And we had an exhibit of work that followed that. 	1
And because of the Internet, and because of connections to blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds, getting involved, working with people on the ground. 	1
UNDCP also published the UNDCP Technical Series, which includes the following issues hitherto: Drugs and Development; The Social Impact of Drug Abuse; Amphetamine-type Stimulants: A Global Review; Drug Money in a Changing World: Economic Reform and Criminal Finance; and Volatile Substance Abuse.	0
The international drug problem continues to evolve into one of the more complex problems of the modern world.	0
This has led the international community to call upon UNDCP to develop guiding principles of demand reduction.	0
The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it. 	1
UNDCP, working closely with Member States, is developing these guiding principles, which will form a declaration that it is hoped will be adopted by the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1998.	0
There is a need to develop methodological knowledge on how to prevent drug abuse by young people and on how to strengthen the involvement of the community as a primary component in prevention strategies.	0
And then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work, because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built. 	1
UNDCP has been called upon to assist Member States in introducing measures against money-laundering.	0
And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in, and that they would rebuild their own home. 	1
The knowledge base that results from the exercises will be made available through publications such as programme advisory notes, handbooks and manuals, and through workshops and meetings.	0
And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. 	1
The implementation strategy combines several elements which have proved to be successful.	0
So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out. 	1
A global model programme to assist youth in crisis started in 1997 and will be completed in late 1998.	0
This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years. 	1
When the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing, and in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside. 	1
This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. 	1
In addition, an inventory of material produced by demand- reduction projects supported by UNDCP will be made available once a year.	0
And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools. 	1
Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. 	1
Priority will also be given, subject to the availability of additional resources, to developing more effective law enforcement counter-measures to the illicit manufacture of drugs, the trafficking in precursors and the diversion to the illicit markets of drugs from licit channels.	0
Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. 	1
UNDCP will also publish a scientific journal (the Bulletin on Narcotics) as an official United Nations publication, in two numbers per year.	0
As a result, the existing database needs to be further developed to accommodate increased information-handling requirements.	0
Activities include: preparing working documents and a draft report of the Board on the implementation of article 12 of the 1988 Convention; providing Governments with relevant information to determine the legitimacy of shipments of precursor chemicals and to advise them regarding decisions on specific suspicious shipments; preparing critical review documents and other relevant materials for the Board and its advisory expert group and for establishing a limited international special surveillance list; and providing substantive advice on activities related to precursor control.	0
The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. 	1
Put one in every favela, every slum settlement. 	1
(c) Objective 3: That criminal justice system personnel dealing with serious international drug-related criminal cases have adequate legal and technical capacity to give and receive, swiftly and effectively, international legal assistance in the investigation, prosecution, adjudication and punishment of those involved (for example, extradition, mutual legal assistance and international confiscation of the proceeds of serious crime);	0
To date, UNDCP justice system training elements have been institutionalized only in the Caribbean, Central America and in west Africa.	0
I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you, "If a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?" 	1
Well, then you'd be screwed, because you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish, and now, since we only have one wish -- unlike last year they had three wishes -- I'm not going to wish for that. 	1
The networks will include those for drugs themselves, precursors and money-laundering.	0
And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student. 	1
I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from, and Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one, but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from. 	1
I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father. 	1
By General Assembly resolution 51/64, UNDCP was requested:	0
To continue to provide legal assistance to Member States as well as assistance in training personnel responsible for applying the new laws (section II, para-graph 4 (c))	0
To continue providing assistance to Member States in establishing or strengthening national drug detection laboratories (section II, paragraph 4 (d))	0
And so I went there and I met some amazing women there. 	1
V.97-28177 (E) 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations International Drug Programme (UNDCP) on the proposed final biennial support budget for 1996-1997 and proposed initial biennial support budget for 1998-1999 of the Fund of UNDCP (E/CN.7/1997/14), in advance copy form.	0
The goal of this new approach, described in detail in Annex III of document E/CN.7/1997/14, is to facilitate clear identification of programme funds as well as funds allocated for the support of activities.	0
I've got to go see what this is all about. 	1
In this connection, the Committee notes, that following a review of potential requirements, the Executive Director in paragraph 13 of Part Two recommends maintaining the level of $12,000,000 to ensure the viability and integrity of the fund.	0
Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film. 	1
The Committee further notes that changes in exchange rates and inflation at headquarters and country offices account for a decrease of $174,400 and $22,000 respectively.	0
We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up. 	1
And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world, we had such incredible reactions. 	1
11. In view of past experience, the Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the increase of $149,700 proposed in relation to the final support budget for 1996-1997 could be funded from savings related to unliquidated obligations.	0
But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like, "Damn, I know where you niggas are coming from. 	1
For example, paragraph 81 and page 75, respectively, of the support budget report, indicate for the current biennium the processing of 1,200 allotments and allocation advices, 800 reviews of quarterly expenditure reports, and 300 travel authorizations, among others.	0
It recommends, therefore, that the Executive Director further explore with donors ways and means to address this issue.	0
The Advisory Committee recommends that the Executive Director review this issue and, in the context of his next report, indicate whether these functions could be carried out by other units or branches, such as the one dealing with inter-agency coordination, which has a staffing component of six posts and whose functions seem somewhat related.	0
I've been listening to the talks in the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity, then they will have an appreciation for ours. 	1
20. In paragraphs 34-37 of its previous report E/CN.7/1997/10, the Advisory Committee addressed the question of recovery of programme support costs, and recommended UNDCP carry out further work to identify the total costs incurred in support of nationally executed projects.	0
It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent voices out there. 	1
But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices, to give power to the filmmakers, to give power to people who are trying to use film for change. 	1
And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. 	1
I'd like for us to imagine for a second. 	1
And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together -- this could be an incredible day. 	1
Now, we've thought about a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you. 	1
I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time. 	1
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim. 	1
It convened two expert group meetings to evaluate the extent and nature of the problem and to adopt recommendations to counter the threat.	0
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age. 	1
Pledges made at the highest political level to deal with the drug problem do not always match the resources provided to reduce the threat posed by drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking.	0
In association with the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention of the United States and the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs of the United States, UNDCP organized at Abidjan in July 1996 a workshop for the training of trainers in demand reduction for 45 officers from 16 countries in western Africa.	0
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago, they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning. 	1
. In 1996, UNDCP provided support to Governments to enhance the effectiveness and capacity of law enforcement services, particular emphasis being given to Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and United Republic of Tanzania.	0
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up, but somehow were not connecting with them. 	1
UNDCP continued to assist the Government of Pakistan in the implementation of an alternative development programme to eliminate illicit poppy cultivation in the North-West Frontier Province.	0
In 1996, some cash crops, particularly onions, generated considerably more income to farmers than opium poppy.	0
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with -- again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house. 	1
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai. 	1
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced. 	1
In 1996, UNDCP initiated a subregional project to reduce drug abuse in the highlands of east Asia. The project targets certain highland regions for community-based demand reduction and social development activities.	0
And what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing, but they're all high-rises. 	1
In May 1996, UNDCP initiated a programme providing assistance in supply and demand reduction to the north-western part of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.	0
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker. 	1
At a follow-up meeting held at Bratislava in October 1996, ministers of those countries adopted a declaration in which they recognized the importance of the legal assistance provided by UNDCP.	0
I think mobile phone companies are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis, and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones. 	1
Initially, joint efforts will focus on the harmonization of national drug control legislation in the context of an ongoing programme related to legal development and cooperation in Central America, funded by UNDCP, the Inter-American Drug Control Commission (CICAD) and the Permanent Central American Commission.	0
A subregional programme was initiated to provide training in the investigation and prosecution of drug cases for judges and prosecutors.	0
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world. 	1
UNDCP has enabled countries in the region to implement several provisions of the Plan of Action by revising UNDCP-assisted programmes initiated prior to its adoption.	0
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there. 	1
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea. 	1
In Asia and the Pacific, national drug control master plans were being implemented by 11 States.	0
And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, "Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?" 	1
Specialized subregional legal workshops focusing on mutual legal assistance were organized for member States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and similar workshops focusing on money-laundering were organized for the Baltic States.	0
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability. 	1
Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six. 	1
The model civil law for licit control and the model penal law was finalized at an expert group meeting held at Vienna from 23 to 27 September 1996.	0
In accordance with the 1991 working arrangements between UNDCP and INCB, the Programme provided secretariat services to the Board, assisting it in monitoring the functioning of the international drug control system, in close cooperation with Governments.	0
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday. 	1
UNDCP convened a working group at Vienna from 10 to 13 December 1996 with expertise in demand reduction to assist the Executive Director in the development of the draft declaration on the guiding principles on demand reduction.	0
There was the baseline -- first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal. 	1
In April 1996, UNDCP, with the support of ICPO/Interpol and the World Customs Organization, organized drug law enforcement workshops in Kyrgyzstan involving the CIS member States in central Asia and States in south-west Asia.	0
We see that the signal that's actually in the heart, we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life. 	1
And if we had a computer that could detect it, we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure. 	1
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical, managerial, monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level.	0
UNDCP has made substantial progress in enhancing its empirical database on illicit crop cultivation through improved survey methodologies and objective assessments.	0
It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo. 	1
We said, so we'll put in a stent, but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people. 	1
To deal with the escalating problem of abuse of and illicit trafficking in amphetamine-type stimulants, UNDCP organized an expert group meeting at Vienna in February 1996.	0
The Meeting was hosted by the Government of China and funded by the Government of Japan.	0
Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats -- this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line. 	1
In order to reach an agreement on practical arrangements for joint activities in the field of law enforcement, UNDCP continued to collaborate with regional and intergovernmental organizations, particularly ICPO/Interpol and the World Customs Organization.	0
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack, your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is. 	1
We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack, and we're going to send the signal to the hospital and we're going to have it analyzed there, and there you're going to be with your doctor and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack." 	1
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives, UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political, economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse.	0
Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter. 	1
In general, project designs were found to be sound, logical, coherent and containing "appropriate" strategies.	0
UNDCP continued to operate in vulnerable conditions, 90 per cent of voluntary contributions to the Fund of UNDCP, which accounts for over 90 per cent of the total budget of UNDCP, being provided by eight Governments.	0
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times, and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches, not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished. 	1
Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" means that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus," which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there, that it's going to happen, and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot, which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache. 	1
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart. 	1
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame. 	1
There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template; he marks it around, and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device. 	1
And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure. 	1
Furthermore, there are indications that the initiation into drug abuse is taking place at an earlier age than before.	0
But even if there is no signal, electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder. 	1
I. THE EXTENT AND PATTERNS OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE WORLD 2-254 4	0
 Well, the third and final wish is somewhat -- unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers. 	1
V. Europe: drug abuse trends, 1992-1995 16	0
She gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island; I landed in San Francisco; and all the press wanted to talk to me, because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. 	1
5. Cannabis-type drugs refer to cannabis products such as hashish and marijuana.	0
Opiate-type drugs provide relief of pain, calm nerves, may reduce hunger pain and reduce nausea and vomiting, and may produce euphoria.	0
And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. 	1
Opiate abuse may mask underlying medical problems such as inflammation and infections because of the analgesic effect of the drugs.	0
High prevalence of heroin abuse was reported by the United States of America (1.8 per cent), Brazil (1 per cent) and Portugal (0.6 per cent).	0
You're reading about Larry Page already. 	1
In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin -- with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation -- in the year in which they were born, two million people died of smallpox. 	1
Other high-prevalence countries are Honduras (7.6 per cent), Chile (5.5 per cent), Colombia (3.4 per cent), Ghana (3 per cent), Namibia (2 per cent), Bolivia (1.8 per cent), Mexico (1.3 per cent), Israel and United States (both 1 per cent).	0
We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers. 	1
A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed was early detection, early response. 	1
22. Reducing the number of people who begin to inject drugs could control HIV transmission to a certain extent.	0
But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. 	1
23. From the figure it can be seen that there is a slight increase in inhaling, smoking or sniffing as opposed to injecting.	0
But we need to have early detection, early response. 	1
Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease. 	1
You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there. 	1
In your TED packages there's a DVD, "Infinite Vision," about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. 	1
South Africa reported injection of amphetamine-type drugs.	0
Chad reported a large increase, reaching an annual illicit consumption level of 0.5 per cent in 1995.	0
32. The trends with regard to abuse of hallucinogens are varied.	0
Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia. 	1
35. In the Americas, the most salient pattern is the increase in the abuse of opiates, alongside a stabilization of cannabis abuse.	0
 And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only did GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 -- but last September. 	1
And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. 	1
The increase is particularly evident with regard to opiate-type drugs and sedatives, even though the prevalence figures for the latter are comparatively low.	0
Let's build in outbound confirmation messages, using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within 100 meters of the rumor that you hear, if it is, in fact, valid. 	1
Heroin injecting practices have been reported in their annual reports questionnaires by India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan.	0
First of all, just so everyone understands: you're saying that by creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? 	1
In the Far East, the most frequently abused stimulant is methamphetamine.	0
In the Philippines, methamphetamine (shabu) is reported to have replaced cannabis as the most widely abused substance.	0
Another synthetic designer drug, sodium oxidate (gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) , also known as "liquid X" or "fantasy") is beginning to show in Europe.	0
And because of that, we were able to stop SARS. 	1
Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now? 	1
The drug abuse behaviour patterns are becoming more homogeneous around the world.	0
It's a journey that started 20 years ago. 	1
Growing levels of unemployment further alienate young people from the older generations.	0
In paragraph 15 of the Global Programme of Action, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution S-17/2 of 23 February 1990 and annexed to that resolution, the Assembly requested the Secretariat to submit, by 31 December each year, a succinct questionnaire to all Governments asking for details of action taken with regard to the seven targets set out in chapter I of the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline covering data collection and prevention activities.	0
69. Targets 1 and 2 of the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline deal with the assessment of the extent of drug abuse and the organization of comprehensive systems for the collection and evaluation of data.	0
It furthermore recommends that countries provide for systematic collection of data on subpopulations of drug abusers from records of the police, registries of deaths, hospital emergency rooms, drug treatment centres, prisons, mental hospitals, psychiatric clinics, social security and welfare organizations and so on.	0
Two countries in the Near and Middle East and one country in Africa reported having such a drug abuse data system.	0
Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford. 	1
There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. 	1
The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough, it would appear. 	1
The types of workers identified by countries as being at high risk of substance abuse are taxi drivers, long-distance truck drivers, construction workers, tourist industry workers, including workers in restaurants and hotels, bar, nightclub and discotheque workers, foreign and migrant workers, miners, businessmen, housewives, refugees, sex workers, factory workers, fishmongers and dock workers.	0
It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking. 	1

Figure X shows the distribution of the types of social reintegration programmes available as reported by Governments.	0
This is the straight truth, the righteous truth. 	1
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this. 	1
 And let me say this without a trace of irony -- before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies. 	1
Part II of the present questionnaire was devised specifically for the System by a group of international experts and approved by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its thirty-fourth session, in May 1991.	0
Countries vary in their ability to collect information on the drug abuse situation.	0
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier, headier days. 	1
(a) To take stock of information requirements to be met through the questionnaire;	0
Some of them are linked together in the International Substance Abuse Epidemiology Network.	0
Furthermore, a system for epidemiological surveillance of drug abuse has been established for Central America.	0
If one part of the system is weak it affects the whole system.	0

I really believe that old Truman line, that if you give the American people the facts, they'll do the right thing. 	1
Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information, its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives, by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school in one African country. 	1
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years. 	1
The illicit production of coca leaf has been estimated by different official sources to range from 309,000 to 493,000 tonnes, which compares with an estimated 306,000 tonnes in 1990.	0
So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now, and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people I've interviewed. 	1
It may be extrapolated that the interdiction rate rose from 13.5 per cent in 1984 to 33.5 per cent in 1995 (also see figure XI).	0
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport, and they should leave the gate there. 	1
Annual cocaine seizures in Europe more than tripled, from 7 tonnes in 1989 to 21.7 in 1995.	0
Current estimates suggest that South Africa, with more than 82,000 hectares under illicit cultivation, may be the world’s largest outdoor producer of cannabis.	0
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. 	1
And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other. 	1
While the main market for indoor-cultivated cannabis is still domestic consumption, increasing amounts are being trafficked, in particular in eastern Europe.	0
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses. 	1
And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare. 	1
As shown in figure VI, Europe accounted for 40 per cent of the global total in 1995, followed by Africa, where Morocco was the main seizure country, with one quarter of the global total.	0
30. In 1995, west European nationals (from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain and United Kingdom) made up 86 per cent of all traffickers arrested for cannabis trafficking in Europe.	0
I didn't even go and see what was happening. 	1
All around her head was just swollen; her head was about two sizes of its own size. 	1
37. Notwithstanding the above uncertainties, it is still noteworthy that overall seizure reports for LSD in the 1990s registered steady and, in 1993 and 1995, sharp increases.	0
Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece. 	1
39. The internationally controlled solvents used in the illicit manufacture of heroin and cocaine are acetone, ethyl ether, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene.	0
It should also be noted that the seizure reports for precursors used for illicit manufacture of psychotropic substances do not reflect the actual extent of illicit manufacture of those substances.	0
In 1995, only ergotamine seizures were reported, by the Russian Federation (30 kilograms), Canada (15 kilograms) and Australia (a few grams).	0
B. Trends in the geographical spread of illicit drug traffic	0
They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King. 	1
The emergence of Afghanistan in south-west Asia and Myanmar in south-east Asia as the two biggest global producers of opiates is clearly indicated.	0
I wish that I could live together with black people. 	1
But after the riot, it's too much difference. 	1

He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway -- so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams, and this is on toughness, in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this. 	1
Significant changes also occurred in the geographical spread as of the mid-1980s, when European countries became seriously affected by cocaine trafficking and abuse.	0
I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene, her family's always saying, you know, you ever think he's just a born loser? 	1
While the total amount seized in those countries is still very limited in terms of the overall global picture, the situation may be compared with that in Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s when cocaine seizures started to rise.	0
The number of countries reporting on cocaine doubled, but the overall amount of reported seizures increased more than twentyfold, from 11.8 tonnes in 1980 to 251 tonnes in 1995.	0
50. A universal trend on the reporting of psychotropic substances is difficult to identify, as the different groups of substances showed different developments.	0
Other main reporting countries were African and Asian.	0
This applies in particular to certain central and eastern European and CIS countries, Africa south of the Sahara and the Caribbean region, for which overviews are given below.	0
The Programme will follow up on this question directly with Governments .	0
The data seem to indicate a slight decline in heroin trafficking in Africa in recent years.	0
According to ICPO/Interpol and the World Customs Organization, the number of cocaine couriers from those countries and, increasingly, southern African countries arrested in Europe also continues to rise.	0
These couriers either travel directly from Latin America (mainly Brazil) or transit through African countries in order to disguise their point of embarkation.	0
57. Because of its geographical location on the major trafficking routes between the drug producing countries in Asia and South America and its now rapidly expanding international trade links with consumer countries in Europe, North America and Latin America, South Africa is an attractive transit country to drug traffickers.	0
Law enforcement reports suggest that relatively large amounts of cocaine are also smuggled by sea to South Africa from Brazil.	0
The relatively greater expansion of cocaine trafficking in South Africa compared with that of heroin can be explained in part by the growing domestic abuse of cocaine and crack cocaine.	0
59. The extent of the drug problem in South Africa and the difficulties involved in addressing the problem can best be illustrated by a recent national presentation on the existence of organized crime groups in South Africa, which indicated the presence in the country of 136 known crime syndicates involved in drug trafficking.	0
Significant seizures in Puerto Rico were also cited in the report of January 1995 of the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee: the United States Coast Guard and the United States Customs Service recovered 10 bales containing 500 kilograms of cocaine following an airdrop in Puerto Rican waters; and Puerto Rican police and the United States Customs Service discovered another 21 bales containing 913 kilograms of cocaine.	0
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. 	1
Those areas account for a rising proportion of both heroin and cocaine seizures made in Europe in the 1990s.	0
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story, it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. 	1
During the early 1990s, the average weight of cocaine seizures in central and eastern Europe increased, that is, the size of intercepted cocaine shipments increased, while the number of interceptions fell.	0
75. The methods of heroin and cocaine trafficking in selected regions described above illustrate how drug traffickers can switch to transportation modes and trafficking routes that lower their risks.	0
The risk of trafficking organizations being detected as a result of seizures can also be lowered by using large numbers of unskilled and cheap couriers to forward relatively small amounts of heroin and cocaine within regions or through transit regions that are not too distant from the final destination and less suspicious to enforcement agencies than the known source countries.	0
In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't. 	1
76. Another option to reduce the traffickers' risk is the exploitation of commercial trade channels for contraband and it has often been suggested that increases in trade and tourism present a greater range of opportunity for smuggling drugs.	0
The paragraphs below, therefore, attempt to outline some linkages between international trade and transportation on the one hand and illicit trafficking of heroin and cocaine on the other in key regions where both trade and tourism have been rising sharply, namely, in Asia and Europe, selected African countries and the Caribbean.	0
To climate change that would be like Kyoto. 	1
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did. 	1
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. 	1
So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have, for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices. 	1
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change. 	1
86. The examples below provide indications of traffickers’ use of advanced technology for their operations, often in regions where even basic communications and detection equipment is lacking on the law enforcement side.	0
In the latter case, one tonne of cocaine was seized from a van, together with semi-automatic weapons, surveillance equipment and scanners tuned by the traffickers to intercept police communications.	0
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. 	1
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question --  -- because that's a very good question. 	1
88. Changes in trafficking patterns call for adjustments to enforcement countermeasures and the 1988 Convention lists a variety of such countermeasures that Governments should implement to fulfil their treaty-based obligations.	0
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards? 	1
So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. 	1
Which is a little good, but not very much good. 	1
This compares with a total of 605 cases reported during 1991-1995, or an average of 99 cases per year until 1995.	0
98. Available data indicate that the average amount of drugs seized per operation is relatively low for cocaine, less than 11 kilograms, which is due to the large number of cocaine shipments by mail. Slightly higher average seizure amounts were achieved in controlled deliveries of opiates, namely, 15.8 kilograms per case, and only for cannabis products did seizure rates equal those of average bulk consignment seizures.	0
As stated earlier, however, the real purpose of a controlled delivery is not the mere seizure of drugs and the arrest of one courier, but the dismantling of international networks and the identification and arrest of organizers.	0
The level of persons arrested in the drug hierarchy was not reported, however.	0
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World. 	1
To recall figures provided in paragraphs 45 to 71, in 1995, 88 countries reported cocaine seizures, of which 20 were in Africa, 14 in the Caribbean and 12 in central and eastern Europe.	0
The number of countries facing major illicit drug trafficking problems in 1995 was thus more than four times higher than that of those reporting on and most probably conducting controlled deliveries and the geographical spread of countries applying controlled delivery remained very limited.	0
102. The drive toward trade and economic liberalization, both within countries and internationally, and the expansion of trade facilitation agreements between and within regions, have significantly increased the options open to drug traffickers and the magnitude and complexity of their operations. They are taking advantage of these developments and increasing the volumes of drug shipments using international trade and transportation.	0
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. 	1
109. An accurate assessment of the extent of illicit drug trafficking remains inherently limited by the quality and reliability of available data.	0
But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. 	1

Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, 	1
It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.  It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. 	1

This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need, the opportunity; they didn't have the incentive to innovate. 	1
about Yochai's presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive. 	1
To that end, they had concluded bilateral agreements for cooperation in the exchange of information and in mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.	0
So what happens? Rap music is created by the users. 	1
They work at their leisure, if you like. 	1
Countries reported increasing numbers of drug-related investigations in which other countries had participated or provided assistance.	0
27. The representatives of India and Pakistan highlighted the continuance of their Governments' agreement to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common border, such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs, as well as on the establishment of systems for the regular exchange of operational information.	0
29. The Federated States of Micronesia drew attention to the position of smaller countries that were vulnerable to the drug menace.	0
Those countries and organizations, together with Australia, Japan and New Zealand, were complimented by a number of representatives for having provided training assistance in the fields of drug law enforcement and financial investigation.	0
34. Many representatives referred to an increasing concern about money-laundering and the need to address the problem.	0
It was noted, however, that a number of States in the region lacked the necessary tools, including trained personnel, to conduct financial investigations or to assist others with such investigations.	0
It was proposed that, should a biennial approach be adopted, special meetings of the subsidiary bodies could be convened if necessary.	0
It was urged that, if the frequency of meetings of all the subsidiary bodies was to be harmonized, the situation specific to each region should be taken into account.	0
What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical, and these, I think, are two challenges for the open movement. 	1

Let me just give you one final example of what that means. 	1
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000. 	1

Nationally and regionally coordinated strategies should be developed for the implementation of the mandates and recommendations contained in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session,1 on 23 February 1990, the Tehran Declaration adopted by the ministerial-level conference at the twenty-eighth session of the Subcommission, held at Tehran in 1993, and other relevant international drug control instruments;	0
"3. Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation, production and trafficking of narcotic drugs, especially in the drug-producing areas of the country, and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform, such as human development and capacity-building, mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income, which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations;	0
"(b) To develop drug intelligence networks to ensure the rapid and secure exchange of information on all illicit drug-trafficking operations;	0
They began as casual vagina interviews, and they turned into vagina monologues. 	1
"9. The international community should be requested to assist and cooperate in the development of illicit crop eradication programmes and to promote alternative development programmes;	0
"10. As proposed in the international drug control treaties, the international community, including intergovernmental bodies, should assist transit countries in enhancing their capabilities to suppress illicit drug trafficking;	0

What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated?" 	1
And it turned out, after thinking and investigating, that I discovered -- and the UN has actually said this recently -- that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime. 	1
That's essentially a gender; that's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women. 	1
This would ensure that during the thirty-third session a review of the status of precursor control and further specific requirements can be undertaken in a working group on this subject;	0
(a) Political and public awareness of the dramatic and destructive effects of illicit opium production should be enhanced, having recourse to farmers, regional and religious leaders, tribal heads and rural communities;	0
A "vagina warrior" is a woman, or a vagina-friendly man, who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it, and rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete, they hold the violence in their bodies; they grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else. 	1
In particular, more forward-looking operating procedures were called for, making it possible to better anticipate and respond to developments and emerging trends.	0
Worthy of note in that connection were the efforts of UNDCP toward promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation across regions.	0
Particular reference was made to initiatives and action taking place under the auspices of UNDCP and the Economic Cooperation Organization, which, at the ministerial level and by means of memoranda of understanding, aimed at coordinating various drug control activities and sponsoring relevant projects.	0

And I can bring that around, put that up there. 	1
Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. 	1
Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. 	1
A. Illicit drug trafficking by sea and smuggling of drugs in containers	0
In its consideration of the topic under review, the working group made the following observations:	0
(a) Coordination between member States needed to be strengthened and enforced;	0
But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, "What do you do?" 	1
C. Exchange of views and information on drug-trafficking organizations	0

 But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. 	1
And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. 	1
As at 31 December 1996, 158 States were parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 520, No. 7515. or to that Convention as amended by the 1972 Protocol,Ibid., vol. 976, No. 14152.	0
Why not? I think this is rather important. 	1
At its thirty-seventh session in 1994, the Commission formulated the methodology it wished to follow in implementing resolution 48/12, and requested the Executive Director of UNDCP to examine the matter with the assistance of an ad hoc intergovernmental advisory group.	0
They're the people who come out the top. 	1
Some of those suggestions are currently being reviewed by parties to that Convention.	0
Many Member States have indicated that the report gives a careful and balanced account of action taken to implement the Global Programme of Action, and has thus served as a suitable monitoring tool.	0
Activities of UNDCP in the framework of the Decade have included, inter alia, the launch of the Goodwill Ambassadors Programme, the organization of specific events, the convening of specialized conferences, workshops and expert group meetings such as the World Forum on the Role of NGOs in Drug Demand Reduction, held at Bangkok from 12 to 16 December 1994.	0
The Department of Public Information and its global network of information centres and services routinely organize programmes and special events for the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM-WIDE	0
And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. 	1
It also requested ACC to review and update, as necessary, the System-Wide Action Plan on a biennial basis, taking into account the need to simplify and streamline its presentation.	0
When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. 	1
In addition, UNDCP has funded a range of projects on drug demand reduction in many Member States.	0
In future, UNDCP will be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors, United Nations entities, international financial institutions and regional organizations involved in development work.	0
In its resolutions 47/97, 47/99, 48/12 and 49/168, the General Assembly called on States to adopt the necessary legislative and administrative measures to ensure that their internal juridical regulations are compatible with the spirit and the scope of the international drug control treaties.	0
From 1990 to date, 409 laws and regulations have been published and distributed.	0
UNDCP also provides, on request, assistance to Member States in establishing or strengthening national drug detection laboratories.	0
The report of the Intergovernmental Expert Group (A/C.3/45/8) was devoted largely to consideration of the availability of reliable data as a basis for estimating the economic and social consequences of drug trafficking, and to the problem of money-laundering.	0
He stressed that efforts even at the national level to institute similar systems had not met with encouraging success on such a broad set of data.	0
 People weren't aware they could have that.  Anyway, she went to see this specialist. 	1
Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. 	1
For the World Summit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen from 6 to 12 March 1995, UNDCP presented a discussion paper on drugs and development and a multi-agency examination of the social and economic impact of drug abuse and control.	0
E. Links between drug trafficking and terrorism The General Assembly has, in its resolutions 46/103, 48/12, 48/112, 49/168 and 50/148, encouraged Governments to deal with the danger and threat posed to civil society by drug trafficking and its links to terrorism, transnational crime, money-laundering and the illicit trade in arms, and to cooperate to prevent the channelling of funds to and between those engaged in such activities.	0
And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, "Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer. 	1
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. 	1
The 1988 Convention, for example, provides that parties shall carry out their obligations under that Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States (article 2, paragraph 2).	0
If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish." 	1
In the same resolution, the Assembly invited the Secretary-General to appoint a senior official at the level of Under-Secretary-General to execute the integration process and head the new Programme with the exclusive responsibility for coordinating and providing effective leadership for all United Nations drug control activities, in order to ensure coherence of action within the Programme as well as coordination, complementarity of action and non-duplication of such activities across the United Nations system.	0
The Executive Director was also entrusted with the direct responsibility for the financial resources of the Fund of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, as a fund for financing the operational activities of UNDCP.	0
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. 	1

 And there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's, "How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?" 	1
But my wife -- who was then my girlfriend -- managed it much better than I've ever been able to. 	1
E. Issue 4: closing the legislative and regulatory gaps 39-52 9	0
 Well, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said, "What does he model?" 	1
So you've had a pretty easy time up till now -- a few laughs, and all that kind of thing -- in the talks to date. 	1
At its thirty-ninth session, the Commission on Narcotics Drugs had before it a report (E/CN.7/l996/12) submitted pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution l995/20, in which the Secretary-General was requested, with the assistance of the Executive Director of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and in consultation with the International Narcotics Control Board, to convene expert meetings in l995 and l996 in order to discuss countermeasures against the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in psychotropic substances, particularly stimulants, and the illicit use of their precursors.	0
Can you imagine tossing a coin successively? 	1
The first Expert Meeting confirmed the principal findings of the global review, which were complemented by additional information supplied by experts, particularly in technical areas and relating to national and regional experiences.	0
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them. OK? 	1
Compared with cocaine, ATS were less expensive, had a longer effect and carried a relatively benign image.	0
The drug control focus at both the national and international levels was still overwhelmingly on the plant-based narcotic drugs, and the threat of ATS was often underestimated.	0
So you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote -- And I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it, until everyone's expressed a view. OK. 	1
The Expert Meeting acknowledged the excellent work done by UNDCP in preparation for the Expert Meeting, including the study Amphetamine-type Stimulants: a Global Review and the discussion paper "Policy options for countermeasures".	0
If you went head-tail-head-tail-head, you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses. 	1
In that context, the Expert Meeting made recommendations covering various matters, outlined below, to reverse the trend of ATS abuse.	0
Legal measures and penalties needed to be commensurate with the acute threat to public health as well as the individual health risks.	0
Governments should give urgent consideration to the introduction of a range of appropriate legal sanctions to be applied to the personal possession and abuse of ATS.	0
International bodies, in particular WHO, should initiate studies to obtain a better understanding of those conditions and their treatment with ATS.	0
Such studies should include an examination of the aetiology, the prevalence and incidence of the conditions, the diagnoses, the duration of treatment and the treatment modalities used in various countries.	0
In contrast, information currently being made available on the Internet had created a situation in which access to heretofore elusive information had become possible for everyone.	0
At the same time, Internet also presented significant opportunities for policy and programme innovation, including the collection and dissemination of information in a timely and cost-effective manner.	0
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals. 	1
(a) Preparations, mixtures, extracts, concentrates and plant raw materials that could be used in the clandestine manufacture of ATS;	0
(b) Coverage of isomers of substances listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 Convention;	0
Governments should make better use of the provisions of the 1988 Convention, article 13, to monitor sales of specific equipment, such as tableting machines, as appropriate to their national situation.	0
So he said, "Here, I'll assume that these events are independent. 	1
There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences. 	1
It's also true -- and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways, you're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right. 	1
Recognizing that the manufacture, trafficking and abuse of ATS, while increasingly a global problem, showed distinct regional characteristics, the Expert Meeting stressed the significance of continued regional cooperation as an effective strategy to cope with the problem.	0
(a) Consultations between States at the regional level before the adoption of amendments to national laws relating to the control of ATS, in order to avoid disparities in the legislation of neighbouring countries (see paragraphs 15, 34, 45 and 46 above);	0
Even if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one, that's not what it meant. 	1
(d) Use of existing regional organizations, consultations, meetings and other working arrangements in drug control as a tool or forum for the regional exchange of experience, new research results and findings relating to various aspects of the problem of ATS;	0
We sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more. 	1
It was hosted by the Government of China and organized by UNDCP in cooperation with the National Narcotics Control Commission of China and the Shanghai Narcotics Control Commission.	0
(d) Clandestine synthetic drugs: dilemmas for control;	0
If you're just talking about social structure, OK, clearly that's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels. 	1
And amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity. 	1
(b) Working Group 2: the dilemma of drug-related information: freedom versus restraint; irresponsible versus responsible information;	0
(c) Working Group 3: reducing economic incentives and limiting the availability of precursors for clandestine manufacture;	0
E. Documentation The documents before the Expert Meeting are listed in annex II to the present report.	0
The discussion of the seven topics under item 2 is summarized below.	0
Now, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called "non-zero sumness." 	1
Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly, the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations are inverse: always a winner and a loser. 	1
While control systems, both national and international, had proved successful in tackling the problem on the licit side (except for a few areas of concern, such as the treatment of attention deficit disorder and obesity, which needed an adequate response), the systems had revealed considerable weakness in preventing clandestine manufacture and illicit consumption of ATS.	0
He concluded that the technically complex ATS problem, with its potential for future expansion into developing countries, needed a global response and strong international commitment.	0
Prevention should be focused on the vulnerable, particularly youth.	0
4. Amphetamine-type stimulants as a national problem:	0
The former emphasized the importance of demand- and supply-reduction activities.	0
it is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean, if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West. 	1
What I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it. 	1
That, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism. 	1
We overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating, and it gets worse and worse and worse. 	1
It's when people's fortunes are correlated. 	1
Detailed recommendations had been made on issues relating to, inter alia, epidemiology, prevention, risk reduction, treatment and research priorities, on the basis of experience acquired in a number of countries.	0
An expert examined the procedures for changing the scope of control of the three international drug control treaties.	0
the grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know why people hate us. I want to understand it. 	1
The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us, is to get them to quit hating us. The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run. 	1
Such amendments could include an assessment of licit requirements for substances in Schedules III and IV, a simplification of the scheduling process and the introduction of a convertibility rule into the 1971 Convention similar to that of the 1961 Convention.	0
B. Discussion of issues by working groups	0
1. Harmonizing national and regional responses to the clandestine synthetic drug problem	0
The Senior Research Coordinator emphasized, as documented in Amphetamine-type Stimulants: a Global Review, that ATS abuse had become a global problem, though with specific regional peculiarities, such as methamphetamine abuse in Asia and amphetamine and ecstasy abuse in Europe.	0
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! 	1
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. 	1
An expert also emphasized the need for harmonization at the regional level in a number of areas, including legislation designed to close loopholes in the control system.	0

Stephen Tse (United States of America), Drug Enforcement Administration, Hong Kong Country Office, Hong Kong	0
When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. 	1
When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old. 	1
You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. 	1
So, everybody's betting their life on something. 	1
And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. 	1
Amphetamine-type Stimulants: a Global Review, UNDCP Technical Series No. 3 (Vienna, 1996)	0
And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, "It's not about you," then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. 	1
That if you are a leader in any area -- in business, in politics, in sports, in art, in academics, in any area -- you don't own it. 	1
For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment. 	1
2. At its thirty-ninth session, the President of the Board made a statement on the subject.	0
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. 	1
A party is obliged to apply such special measures only if it believes them to be necessary.	0
16. The Commission, in its resolution 1 (XXXVIII), requested the Executive Director to ask WHO for an opinion on the growing advocacy of the non-medical use of heroin and its controlled supply to drug addicts.	0
The opinion of the Expert Committee was reported to the Executive Board of WHO in January 1997, but the opinion of WHO was not yet officially available when the present report was prepared.	0
CONTROLLED DISTRIBUTION OF HEROIN TO DRUG ADDICTS	0
17. Pursuant to Commission resolution 1 (XXXVIII), the President of the Board delivered a statement to the Commission at its thirty-ninth session.	0
He argued that while a reduction of harm to the individual might be demonstrated in certain circumstances, the harm caused by such a policy to society as a whole could be highly significant.	0
19. To assist in preparing the present chapter of the report, a questionnaire was sent out by UNDCP to Member States to collect information on ongoing, discontinued and planned programmes for the supply or dispensation of narcotic drugs to drug addicts for maintenance purposes.	0
I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence." 	1
20. Twenty-six States and two territories reported that they had no programmes providing narcotic drugs to drug addicts: Argentina, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cape Verde, Chad, Colombia, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Ghana, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jamaica, Japan, Lebanon, Maldives, Micronesia (Federated States of), Niue, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia, Slovakia, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey.	0
In general, the prevention and treatment means already existing were considered sufficient.	0
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America -- a bunch of gated communities. 	1
You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. 	1
Number one, God never does a miracle to show off. 	1
From 1965 to 1967, stimulants of the central nervous system and opiates (morphine) were legally prescribed to a group of 156 drug addicts at Stockholm.	0
Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this. 	1
In other cases the lack of drug-free treatment services in clinical facilities motivated Governments to authorize the prescription of narcotic drugs to deal with the increasing number of drug addicts.	0
So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income. 	1
So, he's saying, "You're going to lay down your identity. 	1
Some stated that the programmes were an integral part of a series of treatment services available to drug addicts (Denmark and Slovenia), or that research had demonstrated the efficacy of methadone treatment as a general approach (Australia and Canada).	0
Some countries reported that the programmes would continue while funds were available (Latvia), pending legislative and political decisions (Monaco, Kyrgyzstan and Switzerland), or pending a scientific decision made by experts (Finland).	0
And he's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive. 	1
And I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand? 	1
What are you doing with what you've been given? 	1
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc. 	1
in a controlled trial carried out in London during the late 1970s.	0
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages. 	1
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price. 	1
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house; you've got high-quality digital video; you have a reason to have a big-screen television; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound. 	1
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with. 	1
The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1995/40, recommended that the General Assembly and the Commission give priority to considering such a proposal.	0
The preparatory body is expected to meet in 1997 and 1998, during the fortieth and forty-first sessions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs.	0
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. 	1
For the special segment of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, during which it will act as preparatory body for the special session, the Commission will have to elect new, or confirm existing, officers.	0
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa. 	1
After the election of its bureau, the preparatory body will adopt its agenda and timetable for the current session and will address other organizational matters.	0
It may wish to ascertain whether any inter-sessional meetings will be needed or whether other specific activities will be required between its first and second sessions.	0
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival. 	1
Procedural matters examined at the first session of the preparatory body that will require action by the General Assembly before the second session could be included in draft recommendations to be transmitted to the Assembly for its consideration.	0
The preparatory body should consider making recommendations on the following paying due regard to the rules of procedure and practices of the General Assembly: the exact title, draft provisional agenda and dates of the special session; the composition of the bureau; the establishment of an ad hoc committee; and the membership of the Credentials Committee and of the General Committee.	0
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now. 	1
It's an economic force; it's a technical force. 	1
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive. 	1
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute. 	1
so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. 	1
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga. 	1
And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life. 	1
2. In the same section of its resolution 51/64, the General Assembly decided that the special session should be held for three days in June 1998, immediately after the necessary preparatory work had been done to ensure its success and 10 years after the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.Official Records of the United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Vienna, 25 November-20 December 1988, vol.	0
I. ISSUES RELATING TO THE SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON WHICH THE PREPARATORY BODY MIGHT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS	0
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness. 	1
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?" 	1
The preparatory body for the upcoming special session may wish to recommend that that special session should take place under the presidency of the President of the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly.	0
8. The preparatory body may wish to recommend to the General Assembly that it should establish an ad hoc committee of the special session.	0
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. 	1
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles. 	1
2. Preparations for the special session of the General Assembly to consider the fight against the illicit production, sale , demand, traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities and to propose new strategies, methods, practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of drug abuse and illicit trafficking.	0
I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. 	1
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine. 	1
(d) Prevention of and action against money-laundering;	0
(e) Illicit crops eradication and alternative development;	0
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there. 	1
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say. 	1
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand." 	1
14. Follow-up measures for the implementation of the final documents adopted by the special session.	0
PREPARATORY BODY FOR THE SPECIAL SESSION	0
And Europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up. 	1
And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. 	1
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. 	1
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. 	1
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf? 	1
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous with being stupid. 	1
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. 	1
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations. 	1
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. 	1
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down? And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. 	1
And I present myself as Exhibit A, a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic. 	1
I still love speed. You know, I live in London, and I work as a journalist, and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. 	1
But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise. 	1
The special session will be an occasion to reaffirm the importance of the international drug control treaties.	0
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic. 	1
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before. 	1
In addition, many bilateral and regional agreements have been negotiated to further the extradition of drug traffickers, to facilitate the exchange of evidence and to increase cooperation among law enforcement agencies.	0
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read. 	1
In addition, although the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking is one of the most effective tools to undermine drug-trafficking organizations, it has been little used.	0
The International Narcotics Control Board, in chapter I of its report for 1996,Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 1996 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.97.XI.3).	0
The Assembly might consider adopting measures based on those recommendations.	0
The provisions of the 1988 Convention aimed at preventing the diversion of precursors have been supplemented by recommendations of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, the Commission, the Board and the Chemical Action Task Force established by the Heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries.	0
11. The problem of the abuse of and trafficking in stimulants has been increasing in recent years and has now reached a global scale.	0
The Expert Meeting examined the nature and extent of the global problem and recommended concrete measures to tackle it.	0
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. 	1
The General Assembly could assess the current use and availability of methods to identify illicit crops and the use of environmentally safe and effective methods to eradicate them.	0
The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right? 	1
So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years. 	1
Beneficiary countries should also call on the international and regional financial institutions and development aid organizations in negotiating loans and grants to incorporate drug-control objectives in their development programmes. V. STRENGTHENED INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION	0
18. In order to reinforce the United Nations machinery for drug control, the General Assembly, in the deliberations at its special session, could consider how best to reinforce the advocacy and leadership role of UNDCP.	0
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. 	1
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right? 	1
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. 	1
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. 	1
10. The following non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council were represented:	0
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car? 	1
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, which I think is a pretty cool concept, although I think it ought to work the other way around, that it gets brighter the more you don't use. 	1
(a) Conference room paper on the promotion of judicial cooperation (E/CN.7/1997/PC/CRP.5);	0
20. On the issue of controlled delivery, statements were made by the representatives of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Portugal, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay and Venezuela.	0
24. At its 3rd meeting, on 8 October 1997, the second inter-sessional meeting concluded its consideration of agenda item 2.	0
If there are landlines in many developing world cities, they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. 	1
So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. 	1
How many people knew of Lula before today? 	1
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. 	1
At its first session, the Commission acting as preparatory body for the special session adopted decision 1/1, in which it decided to hold informal open-ended inter-sessional meetings from 7 to 9 July 1997, from 7 to 9 October 1997 and on 5 December 1997 (E/1997/48, para. 2). Page	0
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. 	1
You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. 	1
Some of those designs include models for acting, such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. 	1
A. Opening and duration of the meeting 1-3 2	0
We've got to make something better than what we've got. 	1
5. The following non-member States sent observers: Holy See and Switzerland.	0
6. The Centre for International Crime Prevention of the Secretariat and the United Nations International Drug Control Programme were represented.	0
11. The following non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council were represented:	0
The meeting also took note of the progress made by the intergovernmental working group to review and further advance work on the draft declaration on the guiding principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs, and considered elements for possible inclusion in the political declaration (see paragraphs 31 and 36 below).	0
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is. 	1
(c) Conference room paper on the eradication of illicit narcotic crops and promotion of alternative development programmes: proposal by the United States of America (E/CN.7/1997/PC/CRP.9);	0
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991. 	1
19. The representative of the United States introduced a conference room paper containing a draft proposal on eradication of illicit narcotic crops and promotion of alternative development programmes.	0
And you have a problem making ends meet. 	1
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time. 	1
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan. 	1
That was really the only question he had. 	1
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself. 	1
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank. 	1
11. No action is required of the Commission at its forty-first session regarding the proposal made by the Government of the United States.	0
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time. 	1
Considering that measures against the diversion of precursors can only be effective through concerted worldwide action and international cooperation guided by common principles and objectives,	0
And I could spend hours talking about them, because they're all kind of heroes. 	1
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk. 	1
In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running an independent newspaper there. 	1
(f) Adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the disposal of seized chemicals has no harmful effect on the environment.	0
Many States have not yet established systematic mechanisms to ensure such rapid communication exchange, including timely feedback, with other competent national authorities, and with the International Narcotics Control Board, even on a confidential basis.	0
So what the governor got was an empty shell. 	1
The inability to do so may indicate that the framework and systems for adequate control are not in place, and that competencies in the field of precursor control have not been clearly defined.	0
Traffickers have successfully sought to obtain chemicals that may be used as substitutes for those that are more closely monitored.	0
(b) Apply monitoring measures, either mandatorily or voluntarily in cooperation with the chemical industry, so as to prevent the diversion from licit channels to the illicit traffic of substances included on the special surveillance list.	0
PREPARATORY BODY FOR THE SPECIAL SESSION	0
Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click. 	1
The working paper on precursors (E/CN.7/1998/PC/3) will be before the Commission acting as preparatory body for the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1998.	0
Comments and proposed amendments received from Governments and the European Commission in response to the above-mentioned note verbale are contained in the present document.	0
 But --  actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society. 	1
The Secretariat notes that the working paper makes no distinction between those measures that should be applied to Table I substances, Table II substances or both.	0
“Promotion of the implementation, by competent national authorities, of mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of commercial transactions before they take place, including timely feedback to exporting States by States that have received pre-export notifications, and provision for exporting States to hold shipments for up to 15 days to allow importing States adequate time to verify their legitimate end-use”.	0
Any amendment of the current text should not undermine that obligation.	0
Mexico has proposed the deletion of the last sentence of paragraph 12 (b), concerning the informal or formal nature of arrangements.	0
“Promote the exchange of experience relating to police, customs and other administrative investigation, interception, detection and control of diversion of precursors”.	0
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire. 	1
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife. 	1

SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing, until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. 	1
Recalling Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 5 (XXXIX) of 24 April 1996, in which the Commission noted that the forty recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Governments of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission remained the standard by which the measures against money-laundering adopted by concerned States should be judged, as well as Economic and Social Council resolution 1997/40 of 21 July 1997, in which the Council took note with satisfaction of the document entitled “Anti-drug strategy in the hemisphere”, approved by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States at its twentieth regular session, held at Buenos Aires in October 1996 and signed at Montevideo in December 1996, and urged the international community to take due account of the anti-drug strategy in the hemisphere as a significant contribution to the strengthening of the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session,	0
Now watch out, stay away from them now. 	1
Now we can chase them again. Go get them. 	1
Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine? 	1
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster. 	1
Therefore drug demand reduction policies and programmes should address all sectors of society.	0
And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, because if it's too high, you fry them.  So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here, and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel. 	1
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. 	1
 So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. 	1
And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. 	1
And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression. 	1
It has curves in two directions, one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other, so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape. 	1
Article 14 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 states that parties “shall adopt appropriate measures aimed at eliminating or reducing illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, with a view to reducing human suffering and eliminating financial incentives for illicit traffic”.	0
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points. 	1
So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. 	1
Commission on Population and Development	0
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. 	1
III. Primary health care and the health-care sector	0
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process. 	1
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show. 	1
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. 	1
So really, just an amazing image, slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. 	1
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. 	1
Most programme countries in Central Asia and those countries undergoing emergencies were understandably unable to complete the questionnaire.	0
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks: what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble. 	1
The response rate was 23 per cent from international non-governmental organizations but only 2 per cent from intergovernmental organizations.	0
In Bangladesh, efforts are under way by the Government, assisted by the World Bank, to examine the reforms needed for the integration and delivery of primary health care services.	0
A similar effort, also assisted by the World Bank, is under way in Egypt.	0
In several countries, such as Thailand, policies on health are being linked closely with overall policies designed to improve the quality of life.	0
it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what 	1
you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, 	1
In each of the reforms just described, greater emphasis is given to the provision of primary health care and improving access to services.	0
If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?" 	1
Several countries are responding to the needs of indigenous peoples by extending the number of facilities and by training service providers in the relevant languages and in the cultural and social practices that will enable them to better meet the needs of those groups.	0
Policies and programmes in several other countries in Asia, including Nepal and the Republic of Korea, share this emphasis on providing a safe, healthy and sanitary living environment.	0
The provision of health services at the workplace is sometimes open to family members, as in Namibia and Uganda.	0
But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to -- sort of high point with Hans Holbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull. 	1
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. 	1
Increasingly, Governments are recognizing the growing prevalence of disablement and the need to prevent and treat it.	0
And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the world." 	1
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've created, some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here, running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. 	1
Policies and programmes for the disabled are reported in 11 countries in Asia.	0
I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute. 	1
Non-governmental organizations have played a major role in providing assistance to adolescents in those African countries.	0
So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe, where citizens were empowered by technologies. 	1
Existing staff are undergoing retraining to increase technical skills and improve the quality of care.	0
Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way. 	1
On the client side, some countries, such as Eritrea, are emphasizing the use of IEC programmes to educate people on health care, health promotion and the importance of developing an active interest in individual and family health.	0
And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live, to a remote rural area where it was safer. 	1
In Indonesia, for example, child survival policies are linked to efforts at poverty alleviation.	0
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back. 	1
In the present inquiry, provision of vitamin-A supplements was frequently reported as a specific programme component, as is the provision of iodized salt for the prevention of goiter and mental retardation.	0
And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 people. 	1
The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived, there were no telephones. 	1
Seventy per cent of the countries responding report that such programmes are well established and that they have increased exclusive breastfeeding or stopped a decline in the practice that had begun in the previous decade.	0
A study in 1995 showed that 59 per cent of rural and 46 per cent of urban infants are exclusively breastfed for the first four months of life.	0
In a few countries — e.g., India and the Philippines — 15 days of paternity leave is also allowed.	0
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy. 	1
In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. 	1
In the Philippines, it is a basic governmental principle that family planning and reproductive choice should be exercised by individuals and couples.	0
And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet: food, clothing, shelter, whatever. 	1
I created a company in America called Gonofone, which in Bengali means "people's phone." 	1
In 1996, UNFPA provided over $20 million for HIV/AIDS, including prevention activities in 124 countries, and also collaborated with more than 115 non-governmental organizations in those activities.	0
39. Country-level programmes to prevent or reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS vary greatly in response to local needs.	0
40. The long period between first symptoms and the death of persons suffering from AIDS places great strain on already hard pressed families.	0
In Thailand, AIDS patients receive financial assistance from the Government.	0
Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day. 	1
The only exceptions are those with resource constraints.	0
If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference, or landing on the moon, or this other stuff, it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference. 	1
Some countries are undertaking special surveys on nutrition and male reproductive health, and specific mention was made by five countries of research programmes on adolescent health.	0
In Africa, because you didn't have these cities, you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation. 	1
And in the measure that we map ourselves, this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on. 	1
They also conduct seminars and speak to schools and youth groups on legal rights and the rights of the child.	0
Further workshops have been requested to reach out to more young people and to include sessions with parents, as most problems are family-based.	0
A continuing area of conflict is how customary law and the formal legal system conflict.	0
Each year the fund would honour an institution in a developing country which adapted and offered its services to people from countries in the region.	0
They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code, take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg, reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code. 	1
The latest procedures and criteria as approved by the Board are contained in document E/ICEF/1994/L.16.	0
Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years, because we've evolved from that stuff, you can take that tree of life and collapse it back, and in the measure that you learn to reprogram, maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. 	1
Lastly, due regard shall be given to equitable geographical balance.	0
 The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life. 	1
And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit. 	1
Because this thing codes ones and zeros, and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there, absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right? 	1
 And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is, it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that, AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root. 	1
Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant. 	1
 The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child, and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew. 	1
(c) Organization of the work of future sessions.	0
How's this stuff work? If each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes, which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent, very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence. 	1
The main documents for the session will consist of the conclusions of the AG13 at its third session (FCCC/AG13/1996/4) and any proposals from Parties submitted since the third session.	0
A suggested approach to the organization of work is contained in annex II below.	0
(c) Organization of the work of future sessions	0
The fifth session of the AG13 will be held within the period 28 July to 7 August 1997 in Bonn.	0
The Chairman will provide further information on the precise dates of the fifth session once the outcome of the discussions by the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties on this matter is known.	0
The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing, and it turns out that this is not so important any more. 	1

Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours. 	1

I. OPENING OF THE SESSION 1 - 2 3 (Agenda item I)	0
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified. 	1
The AG13 agreed to the admission of ten non-governmental organizations and two intergovernmental organizations that had been screened by the secretariat, on the basis of the provisions of Article 7.6 of the Convention, without prejudice to subsequent action by the COP.	0
A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua, and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child. 	1
At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador, and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. 	1
At its 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th meetings on 28, 29 and 30 July, respectively, the AG13 considered paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of annex II of its working document.	0
It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. 	1
He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton, yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move. 	1
This time, maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia, the international community remained silent, and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors -- using farm implements as weapons. 	1
Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda, when Serbia attacked Kosovo, international action was taken much more decisively. 	1
Children who couldn't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages. 	1

For the first time in years, Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura, and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion. 	1

I tried to imagine myself in their place, and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss. 	1
Referring to the Synthesis of proposals by Parties (FCCC/AGBM/1996/10), the Chairman noted that this document highlighted some similarities between different options proposed by Parties, as well as revealing remaining areas of divergence.	0
The Executive Secretary welcomed all participants to the session.	0
He noted with satisfaction that Parties are giving increasing thought to the specific content of their proposals.	0
Sometimes they put their lives on the line, because they believe your opinions and your influence matter. 	1

(a) Reiterated that the protocol or another legal instrument to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its third session should implement fully the terms of the Berlin Mandate, and underlined that the Berlin Mandate process will not introduce any new commitments for Parties not included in Annex I, but will reaffirm existing commitments in Article 4.1, and continue to advance the implementation of these commitments in order to achieve sustainable development, taking into account Article 4.3, 4.5 and 4.7;	0
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it. 	1
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. 	1
The proposals on which this document is based are contained in documents FCCC/AGBM/1996/MISC.2 and Add.1-4 and FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.1.	0
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. 	1
And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique, Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing: to save as many lives as quickly as we can, but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. 	1
3. Preparation of a protocol or another legal instrument	0
(see FCCC/AGBM/1996/11, para. 23 (b)), the AGBM will, under each sub-item of this item, give in-depth consideration to the relevant sections of the framework compilation of proposals, and to any proposals submitted after 15 January 1997.	0
The AGBM may wish to concentrate on narrowing the range of proposals in order to focus on the major options achievable within the time-frame of the Berlin Mandate.	0
Where similar proposals exist, Parties may wish to seek to consolidate these into single proposals.	0

Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's? 	1
There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but let's face it, he was also very judgmental. 	1
An additional informal round table will be convened on Monday, 3 March 1997 at 6 p.m. to consider the results of the Chairman's work with interested delegations on differentiation and criteria for differentiation among Annex I Parties.	0

Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. 	1
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York. 	1
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. 	1
 I wanted to say --  "Ok, don't start with this story." 	1
8.8 "Annex III Parties" means developing country Parties whose economies are highly dependent on the exploitation, production, processing and exportation of fossil fuels.	0
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart? 	1
 Before my father death, he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars, which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war. 	1
 This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him, my father insisted it was not in his possession, and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund. 	1
25.5 In order to provide each Annex A and Annex B Party with necessary flexibility, if the real reduction in net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases achieved by any such Party in previous years was greater than its appropriate level of commitments, this difference (determined in terms of the sum of annual reductions of tonnes of carbon equivalent) will be accounted for this Party for the next period in its quota of net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.

 I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.  Not just the good stuff, though. 	1
For purposes of Article 17.5 of the Convention, the phrase "Decisions under any Protocol" shall not be interpreted or applied to include adoption of an amendment to this Protocol.	0
 "Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad --  I'm trying." I don't know if you're all aware of this, but the video game market, kids are playing these video games, but, supposedly, there's tons of money. 	1
For purposes of Article 17.5 of the Convention, the phrase "Decisions under any Protocol" shall not be interpreted or applied to include adoption of an annex to this Protocol nor amendment to any such annex.	0
 It's, like -- seriously, though --  I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves. 	1
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing, and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure, awful little thing that they created. 	1

The sixth session of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (hereinafter referred to as "the AGBM") was held at the Stadthalle Bad Godesberg, Koblenzer Strasse 80, Bonn, from 3 to 7 March 1997.	0
I think that the "now tied up, tied down, mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up." 	1
He recalled that this sixth session of the AGBM was the last to take place before 1 June 1997, by which time the text of a proposed Protocol would need to be circulated to Parties in all six languages of the United Nations in order to fulfil the requirements of Article 17.2 of the Convention.	0
And very, very quickly -- I love puppets. Here's a puppet. 	1
Finally, the Executive Secretary remarked that the absence of quantified targets represents an important missing element from the proposals of a number of Parties.	0
I became interested in puppets, and I just want to show one last thing to you. 	1
 Chris Anderson: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank. 	1
And I think the reason for that --  -- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's -- well, it's as Chris said, bonkers. 	1

At the 1st meeting of the AGBM, on 3 March, the Chairman recalled that there would be services available for 10 meetings, with interpretation from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.	0
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole, geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. 	1
We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt; we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio, and they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time. 	1
On the basis of a proposal by the Chairman, the AGBM, at its 4th and 5th meetings, on 6 and 7 March respectively, adopted text on elements related to strengthening the commitments in Article 4.2(a) and (b) for inclusion in the negotiating text.	0
The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga, which was the sort of last bit of civilization. 	1
At the 5th meeting of the AGBM, on 7 March, the Chairman recalled that, as noted in the Provisional Agenda and Annotations (FCCC/AGBM/1997/1), a draft report on the session had not been prepared.	0
The AGBM also agreed that the negotiating text, to be prepared by the Chairman would be issued as an Addendum to the report on the session.	0

I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year, and I was drifting backwards most of the time. 	1
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway -- based on a sort of survival suit -- I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear -- that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens, it would pull up around my face, and seal pretty tightly around my face. 	1
Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone, Iridium satellite phone. 	1
There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there, purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. 	1

This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits -- really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch. 	1
That's as close as I can come to summing that up. 	1
At its sixth session, the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) requested the Chairman, assisted by the secretariat, to complete the negotiating text for a protocol or another legal instrument in time to enable the secretariat to make it available to the Parties in the six languages of the United Nations by 1 June 1997, and thereby meet the requirements of Article 15.2 or 17.2 of the Convention.	0
The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret -- and the last question, what's next? As quickly as possible, if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail. 	1
This note responds to the above mandate by organizing the texts adopted by the AGBM at its sixth session into a negotiating text for a protocol or another legal instrument (hereinafter referred to as "the instrument").	0
The original texts of all the proposals which make up the negotiating text can be found in documents FCCC/AGBM/1996/MISC.2 and Add.1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.1 and Add.1 and 2, the latter including new proposals received since the sixth session of the AGBM.	0
  I think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else is the authority on your potential. 	1
It takes the original principle of the Internet, which is inter-networking computers, and now lets devices inter-network. 	1
Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof",	0
Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. 	1
Recognizing also the fact that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions,	0
Recognizing the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation, as a consequence of action taken on limiting greenhouse gas emissions,	0

And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me: it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway -- this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are -- the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in. 	1
Response to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking into full account the legitimate economic growth and the eradication of poverty.	0

And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. 	1
And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. 	1
(ii) The Meeting of the Parties has determined that a declaration so made satisfies the requirements of this Article.	0
This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. 	1

I want to give the name "Middle World" to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with "Middle Earth" -- Middle World.  We are evolved denizens of Middle World, and that limits what we are capable of imagining. We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like, when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move, 	1
As frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office. 	1
'What is the wall mostly made of?' 'Atoms!' All I have to do is merge the spaces. 	1
But we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion. 	1
In the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity, but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension. 	1
Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium: the ether. But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World, where matter is a useful fiction. 	1
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. 	1
Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. 	1

J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell. 	1
The only difference, you see, is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. 	1
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells, just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes. 	1

We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. 	1
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions. 	1

It's just making you expect the detail. 	1
It is anticipated that the AGBM will complete its work at the eighth session and transmit the results to the Conference of the Parties (COP) for finalization and subsequent adoption.	0
The AGBM will have before it the negotiating text by the Chairman (FCCC/AGBM/1997/3/Add.1) and additional proposals from Parties referred to in paragraph 8 above.	0

 Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help. 	1
But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this. 	1
What you're going to see is two pictures, one of which is slightly different from the other. 	1
We're going to start easy. Some examples. 	1
The Chairman emphasized that the task of the AGBM was restricted to fulfilling the Berlin Mandate.	0
He welcomed the revised proposal from the European Community and its member States, which offered specific commitments, but noted that the Group awaited similar details from other governments.	0
In closing, the Chairman noted that world economic statistics had shown that the economies of Annex I Parties as a whole had continued to grow over the past few years.	0
He noted that a 0.3-0.6 degrees Celsius rise in temperature in this century has been observed and that "assuming the 'best estimate' value of climate sensitivity and including the effects of future increases of aerosols, models project an increase in global mean surface air temperature relative to 1990 of about 2 degrees Celsius by 2100".	0
Professor Bolin further noted that that value may be understated.	0
He observed that Annex I Parties had contributed 75 per cent of global emissions in 1985 and would continue to produce the majority of global emissions for the next 15 to 20 years.	0
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. 	1
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. 	1
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is, someone who is basically a percussion player ...  And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...  And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just --  -- thinking about. 	1
Statements were made by representatives of four Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).	0
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?" 	1
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. 	1
And I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. 	1
I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps -- but something like this. Let me change.  Something that's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound. 	1
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. 	1
Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc. 	1
We just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that's what deafness is about. 	1
Those are hugely important aspects to think about. 	1
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way. 	1
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder." 	1
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. 	1
The proposals on which these documents are based are contained in documents FCCC/AGBM/1996/MISC.2 and Add.1-4 and FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.1 and Add.1-5.	0

Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds." 	1

And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so called "music institution," all of that went out of the window. 	1
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that? 	1
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. 	1
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening. 	1
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate, because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed? 	1
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great. 	1
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act, then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as, "Brain death for all children. No child left behind." 	1

If we look at the world of architecture, we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin, the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?" 	1
And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston, and the windows are all closed. And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use, this is actually a vertical gas chamber. 	1

He recalled that no decision had yet been made by the Group on whether to adopt a protocol or another legal instrument.	0
The Chairman therefore undertook to prepare a draft text for an amendment to the Convention, based on the revised text under negotiation and taking into account the documents and proposals still on the table.	0

Now, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism, and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do. 	1
To this end, the SBI, at its fifth session, recommended that “after dealing with the opening and organizational matters, COP 3 would immediately allocate the completion of decisions on the Berlin Mandate process to a sessional committee of the whole, open to all delegations” (FCCC/SBI/1997/6, para. 44 (c)(ii)).	0

At its sixth session, the SBI was informed by the secretariat that no offer to host COP 4 had been received.	0
The SBI invited any Party desirous of making an offer to host COP 4 to communicate such proposal to the secretariat before 30 September 1997 so that the secretariat could take it into account in its planning for the Conference (FCCC/SBI/1997/16, paras. 35 and 37).	0
The Conference will have before it for adoption the report on credentials to be submitted by the Bureau.	0

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the COP and the Council of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) provides, inter alia, that the Conference of the Parties should receive and review at each of its sessions a report from the GEF which should include specific information on how it has applied the guidance and decisions of the Conference of the Parties in its work related to the Convention (see decisions 11/CP.2 and 12/CP.2).	0
(d) Second review of adequacy of Article 4.2(a) and (b)	0
The COP may wish to draw on the first compilation and synthesis of second national communications of Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/1997/19 and Add.1) and its review by the SBI at the latter’s seventh session.	0
We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists. 	1
At its second session, the COP considered a request from the Czech Republic and Slovakia that the name of Czechoslovakia be deleted from Annex I to the Convention, and that the names of the Czech Republic and Slovakia be included in its place.	0
I think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind." 	1

The COP is invited to commence the review of the lists in Annexes I and II to the Convention at this session, taking into account the discussions on annexes in other subsidiary bodies and on the basis of information provided by the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the proposals from Pakistan and Azerbaijan.	0
The text of any proposed amendment to the Convention shall be communicated to the Parties by the secretariat at least six months before the meeting at which it is proposed for adoption.	0
The secretariat shall also communicate proposed amendments to the signatories to the Convention and, for information, to the Depositary”.	0
A report on the work of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate will be given by the Chairman of the AGBM under item 3 (a)(iii) of the provisional agenda.	0
Priority will be given to the scheduling of statements by ministers.	0
And this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting, more poetic, more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination. 	1
The universe is much bigger than our prophet said, grander, more subtle, more elegant'? Instead they say, 'No, no, no! 	1
The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits -- by foundations, such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute. 	1

Item 2 (e). Admission of organizations as observers	0
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough. 	1
During the October sessions of the subsidiary bodies, the COP Bureau considered the list of applicants from observer organizations and authorized the secretariat to advise all applicants of their "pre-admittance status", on the understanding that the final authority for the admission of observers rests with the COP.	0
So I've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace "global warming." 	1

In pursuit of the ultimate objective of the Convention as stated in its Article 2,	0
So this is a query that we had -- I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. 	1
In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time. 	1
(iii) Promotion, development and increased use of renewable forms of energy and of innovative environmentally sound technologies;	0
The Meeting of the Parties shall assess the application of these policies and measures;	0
But it was a dream of his, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them. 	1
The Conference of the Parties to the Convention may take further action, as appropriate, to promote the implementation of the provisions of this subparagraph;	0
And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S. 	1
Any Parties included in Annex I [or acting under Article 10] that have agreed that they shall jointly fulfil their obligations with respect to quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives shall be deemed to have met those obligations provided that their total combined level of emission reductions meets the levels as set out in Attachment 1 for those Parties.	0
And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. 	1
Parties participating in joint implementation projects have the right to share [among themselves] the credits attributed to the project.	0
The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important, and so naturally, people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. 	1
They shall be subject to stringent emission reduction [or removal] verification and accountability methodologies.	0
Parties shall report on joint implementation projects in their national communications using guidelines to be adopted by the Meeting of the Parties at its first session and periodically reviewed thereafter.	0
And we didn't like that, so we actually, in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. 	1
If a question of a Party's implementation of the requirements of this Article is identified in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, transfers and acquisitions of emission credits may continue to be made after the question has been identified, provided that any such credits may not be used by any Party to meet its obligations under Article 3 until any issue of compliance is resolved.]	0
And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. 	1
3. Each Party included in Annex I [or acting under Article 10] shall submit the information required under this Article as part of the first national communication due under the Convention after this Protocol has entered into force for that Party and after the adoption of guidelines as provided for in paragraph 4 below.	0
The review process shall provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of all aspects of a Party’s implementation of this Protocol.	0
[Article 10 The Group of 77 and China have requested the deletion of this Article.	0
(b) Each developed country Party and each other developed Party included in Annex II to the Convention shall incorporate into its national programmes the quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives and related policies and measures under this Protocol, including details of measures undertaken by them to promote, facilitate and finance transfer of technology, provide new and additional financial resources and assist in meeting costs of adaptation in developing countries.	0
(f) Co-operate in scientific and technical research and systematic observation and development of data archives to reduce uncertainties related to the climate system, the adverse impacts of climate change and the economic and social consequences of various response strategies, and promote the development and strengthening of endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental efforts, programmes and networks on research and systematic observation, taking into account Article 5 of the Convention;	0
The Conference of the Parties, the supreme body of the Convention, shall serve as the Meeting of the Parties to this Protocol.	0
And that's unlike many of our competitors. 	1
(i) Establish such subsidiary bodies as are deemed necessary for the implementation of this Protocol;	0

When the subsidiary bodies exercise their functions as the subsidiary bodies of this Protocol, decisions under this Protocol shall be taken only by those of its members that are, at that time, Parties to this Protocol.	0
When the subsidiary bodies exercise their functions with regard to matters concerning this Protocol, any member of the Bureau of the subsidiary bodies representing a Party to the Convention but, at that time, not a party to this Protocol, shall be substituted by an additional member to be elected by and from amongst the Parties to this Protocol.	0
Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in. 	1
When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. 	1
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. 	1
The adopted annex or amendment to an annex shall be communicated by the secretariat to the Depositary, who shall circulate it to all Parties for their acceptance.	0
If the adoption of an annex, other than Annex A or B, or an amendment to an annex involves an amendment to this Protocol, that annex or amendment to an annex shall not enter into force until such time as the amendment to this Protocol enters into force.	0
People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. 	1

Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't, except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. 	1
Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it. 	1
Some of them we're going to fix, though. 	1
And most of them are still going to be there, although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished. 	1
No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it. 	1
6. The President held informal consultations on draft rule 42, paragraph 1, with some ministers during the high-level segment of the UNEP Governing Council in February 1997, Nairobi, Kenya.	0
In addition to the views expressed on that occasion, some ministers communicated views and comments to the President in writing.	0
(a) Consensus or general agreement on all matters of substance (including the adoption of a protocol);	0
I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984 but I've been to a lot of them since that time. 	1
(g) Seven-eighths on all mattters of substance (consensus required for a protocol); and	0
(c) Wherever it is not possible to reach decisions by consensus, the Parties may resort to voting.	0
8. The President of COP 2 wishes to advance the following options on substantive decision-making for consideration by the Conference of the Parties:	0
Also, though we designed it a few years ago -- it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so -- this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. 	1
Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models -- you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings. 	1
This large majority for substantive decisions should meet the concerns of all groups of Parties, including those that fear that their concerns may not be taken into account if voting majorities are not large enough.	0
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship. 	1
11. The President discerned a certain interest in this option and suggests the COP may wish to give further consideration to it.	0
13. Several of the Parties involved in the informal consultations did not favour reopening discussions on draft rule 22.	0
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever. 	1

1. Any body or agency, whether national or international, governmental or non-governmental, which is qualified in matters covered by the Convention and which has informed the secretariat of its wish to be represented at a session of the Conference of the Parties as an observer may be so admitted unless at least one third of the Parties present at the session object.	0
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes. 	1
Representatives shall be entitled to participate provisionally in the session, pending a decision by the Conference of the Parties to accept their credentials.	0
2. The officers referred to in paragraph 1 above, shall remain in office until their successors are elected at the next ordinary session and shall serve in that capacity at any intervening extraordinary sessions.	0
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life. 	1
So here's the first punch line: cities have defused the population bomb. 	1
And I'll try to do all that in 20 minutes. I have two affiliations. 	1
Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park, and we study theoretical neuroscience, and we study how the neocortex works. 	1
And I've done this because I really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing, and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. 	1
But this was, I have to admit, all an accident. 	1
I was looking for a picture of graffiti, little text input language, and I found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these, you know, the script writing things across the top of their blackboard, and they had added graffiti to it, and I'm sorry about that. 	1
(b) Receive, translate, reproduce and distribute the documents of the session;	0
(f) Perform all other work that the Conference of the Parties may require.	0
Today is, I think, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. 	1
And he wrote a story basically saying, well, this is all well and good, but you know what, we don't know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work, so don't believe what anyone tells you. 	1
This is a quote from that article. He said, "What is conspicuously lacking," he's a very proper British gentleman so, "What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches." 	1
The President shall not declare a meeting of the Conference of the Parties open or permit the debate to proceed unless at least one third of the Parties to the Convention are present.	0
The presence of two thirds of the Parties to the Convention shall be required for any decision to be taken.	0
First, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there, and I said, well, I want to build intelligent machines, too, but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first. 	1
The President may call a speaker to order if his remarks are not relevant to the subject under discussion.	0
2. The Conference of the Parties may, on a proposal from the President or from any Party, limit the time allowed to each speaker and the number of times each representative may speak on a question.	0
Well, it took longer than four years. It's been about 16 years. 	1
Proposals and amendments to proposals shall normally be introduced in writing by the Parties and handed to the secretariat, which shall circulate copies to delegations.	0
But sometimes, a science has some other attributes which makes it really, really interesting. 	1
Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves, it'll tell us who we are. 	1
And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. 	1
4. If, on matters other than elections, a vote is equally divided, a second vote shall be taken.	0
You're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. 	1
A motion is considered to be an amendment to a proposal if it merely adds to, deletes from, or revises parts of that proposal.	0
And there's really no evidence that says -- well, other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do. 	1
Now, there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is, I'm going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science. 	1
The President shall not permit the proposer of a proposal or of an amendment to a proposal to explain his vote on his own proposal or amendment, except if it has been amended.	0
The best minds were stumped -- really, really smart people. 	1
Do you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour? 	1
What it is is intelligence is defined by prediction. 	1
And Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which is essentially saying, we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human. 	1
The word came into you, and you're making these predictions all the time. 	1
On 9 December 1997, the Bureau met to examine the credentials submitted by Parties to the Convention. GE.97-65124 English Page	0
It's all those things, and all those gut reactions you have. 	1
And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. 	1
And if you're a rat and you go through a maze, and then you learn the maze, the next time you're in a maze, you have the same behavior, but all of a sudden, you're smarter because you say, oh, I recognize this maze, I know which way to go, I've been here before, I can envision the future. And that's what it's doing. 	1
In humans, we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. 	1
The measures described in the national communication target the energy and transformation sector, which is the main source of GHG emissions in Latvia - accounting for more than one third of total CO2 emissions in 1990.	0
Latvia has a wind turbine project in Ainazi as an Activity Implemented Jointly with the Government of Germany.	0
And so when you look at someone's face, you'd typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth. 	1

This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence? 	1
This is due to the high share of renewables as well as the relatively low energy consumption.	0
I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back up on this stage, maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. 	1
It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output. 	1
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain. 	1
I don't know how this is going to turn out. 	1
In the same way, this is like brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology, and it's going to lead to very unbelievable changes in the next 100 years. 	1
The commitment to pursue greenhouse gas mitigation was first formulated by the Danish Government in Our Common Future, the Danish Government's Action Plan on Environment and Development (Follow-up to the Recommendations in the Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development and the UN Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000) (1988) (referred to in this document as the Danish Government's Action Plan on Environment and Development of 1988) which was drafted as a national follow-up to the report of the Brundtland Commission.	0
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories. 	1
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish. 	1
Fuel combustion is the dominant source of CO2 emissions.	0
 And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna. 	1
By 1988, substantial energy savings and efficiency gains had been achieved, in particular in the heating of dwellings.	0
Energy and carbon taxes on fossil fuels and on electricity have been applied in Denmark for a long time.	0
Electricity grids are divided into two parts, the eastern part linked to Scandinavia and the western part to the European mainland.	0
The objective is to connect as many consumers as possible within the areas covered by the grid.	0
In general, there is a ban on the establishment of electrical heating in areas supplied by gas or district heating.	0
  So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now. 	1
A gasoline and diesel tax was introduced as a result of a decision taken in 1992.	0
But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. 	1
While Denmark has a long coastline and harbours and low-lying areas are regarded as vulnerable, it was felt that the impacts of sealevel rise could be controlled by management.	0
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there. 	1
In preparing its national GHG inventory, Estonia has followed, as far as possible, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (1994) and has initiated work, with the assistance of the United States Country Studies Program, to develop data using the IPCC standard tables and worksheets.	0
Estonia̓s per capita energy consumption is now at levels similar to those of neighbouring OECD member countries but pollution levels, and the energy and carbon intensity of the Estonian economy, remain higher than in European OECD countries by a factor of two for energy intensity, and a factor of four for carbon dioxide.	0
The statistics system has undergone major modifications, which has made it particularly difficult to prepare the inventory and projections of greenhouse gas emissions.	0

On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. 	1
Finland provided inventories for the three main greenhouse gases as well as the indirect ones.	0
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail. 	1
Finland has successfully introduced energy efficient technologies such as district heating, which covers 45 per cent of the heat supply, and combined heat and power (CHP), which currently supplies 30 per cent of the electricity.	0
As a consequence of joining the European Union and the fact that other countries do not have a similar tax structure, it will be changed in 1997, in particular for electricity, to become more indirect and will thus also be potentially less environmentally effective.	0
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. 	1
A considerable amount of research has been carried out through a comprehensive programme specifically devoted to climate change between 1990 and 1996.	0
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start. 	1
There has also been considerable research and development on technological mitigation options, in particular for the energy sector, as described in the communication.	0
Finland contributed US$ 20.6 million to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in its pilot phase and is contributing US$ 21.7 million to the first replenishment.	0
Finland is also funding a considerable number of projects in countries with economies in transition.	0
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies, and three or four others have come in. 	1
The original target of the United Kingdom̓s GHG programme set in 1994 was to return CO2emissions in 2000 to their 1990 level by achieving a reduction of around 37,000 Gg CO2 or 10 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon (C).	0
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. 	1
The United Kingdom largely relied on its own methods for estimation of GHG emissions and followed quite closely the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporting structure.	0
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. 	1
This allows motorists to respond in the most efficient and flexible way, by driving less, purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles or adopting more economical driving styles.	0
The results of modelling indicate that, based on the assumptions used, in each scenario projected CO2 emissions in 2000 would not exceed their 1990 level even without additional measures listed in the climate change programme.	0
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. 	1
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. 	1
The in-depth review of the national communication was carried out from November 1996 to May 1997 and included a visit by the review team from 25 to 29 November 1996.	0
High priority is placed on bringing its legislation into line with that of the European Community in anticipation of possible membership in the future, and on establishing a legal framework to support a market economy.	0
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. 	1
The unemployment rate was above 10 per cent, and Hungary had a considerable foreign debt.	0
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever. 	1
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. 	1
Reserves of other fossil fuels are small, while some renewables may have greater potential despite being little utilized at present.	0
Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming, and everybody agreed, there's a real problem. 	1
The CO2 figures in the communication included emissions from bunker fuels and feedstocks.	0
However, implementation has been severely hampered by lack of public funding, which is particularly important given the high inflation and interest rates.	0
These issues were not covered in the communication.	0
They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road. 	1
And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies. 	1
We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same. 	1
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. 	1
 It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? 	1
The share of process emissions from industry (CO2 and PFCs) is particularly high.	0
Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here? 	1
But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change? 	1
This builds on activities carried out over many years, and the team in particular noted the efforts to utilize renewables.	0
I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why? 	1
In fact, I'm certain California's not enough. 	1
The projections had been revised before the team's visit.	0
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from. 	1
He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. 	1
And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it. 	1
In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. 	1
That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. 	1
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. 	1
Emission projections were based on standard regression models, without the use of macroeconomic and energy models.	0
Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know. 	1
Based on information received during the visit on some early efficiency gains and recent further inroads of natural gas, it is estimated that the national CO2 growth limitation target is within reach.	0
Preliminary estimates indicate that CO2 emissions may be increasing more slowly than originally expected, even though GDP grew faster than expected at the beginning of the decade.	0

And as soon as they had laid all these, all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India, he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium, the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes. 	1
The in-depth review of Italy was carried out between November 1996 and February 1997 and included a visit to Rome from 11 to 15 November 1996.	0
The review team included experts from the Islamic Republic of Iran, Colombia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.	0
He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. 	1
Its population has stabilized at the 57 to 58 million mark.	0
With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened. 	1
This process has been driven by the deliberate decision to involve greater private participation in the energy sector, as well as to ensure consistency with a EU decision which calls for deregulation in national energy markets.	0
When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel. 	1
Preliminary CORINAIR emission inventories for 1991-1994 were provided during the review.	0
If these new estimates are confirmed, higher emissions, despite the increased use of natural gas, would most probably be due to a sharp increase in emissions in the transport sector and higher overall energy consumption as economic growth resumed in 1994 Recent estimates prepared according with the simplified IPCC top-down approach indicate that energy-related CO2 emissions in 1995 were 3.3 per cent higher than in 1990, due to resumed economic growth and reduced hydroelectric production.	0
However, most of the laws and directives discussed are either very general (with no direct fiscal or other economic incentives attached to them) or seriously under-funded, hindering the achievement of their initial objectives and potential mitigation effects.	0
Italy does not have a strong and concerted national action plan to mitigate climate change.	0
The transport sector is Italy's perennial weak point.	0
The team recommends that the description of policies and measures be updated in the second communication to account for major developments that have occurred since mid-1994.	0
The team found that such information greatly improved the understanding of projections of Italy's CO2 emissions for 2000 and strongly recommends that projections be thoroughly revised in a transparent manner for the second communication, taking into account major developments in the energy sector since 1994 as well as CO2 emissions originating in sectors other than fuel combustion.	0
In absolute terms 1994/1995 ODA was US$ 2,705 million, having declined over the last few years.	0
The review team included experts from Algeria, Romania and Belgium.	0
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years. 	1
Luxembourg is a supporter of the introduction of a CO2/energy tax at the EC level, especially if implemented in the transport and residential sectors.	0
The inventories prepared were based on the CORINAIR CORINAIR is the component dealing with air emissions inventories of the European Economic Community CORINE (Coordinated Information System on the State of Natural Resources and the Environment).	0
According to the 1990 GHG inventory, the shares of CO2, methane CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the national total were 94 per cent, 5 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively.	0
Fuel combustion contributed 94 per cent to the total CO2 emission; 62.4 per cent of fuel combustion emissions were due to industry, 17.7 per cent to energy transformation, 8.5 per cent to transport and 7.6 per cent to the residential sector.	0
Agriculture was responsible for 79.3 per cent of total N2O emissions and energy and transformation for 17.0 per cent.	0
"Fuel tourism" also contributes substantially to the emissions attributed to the transport sector.	0
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. 	1

Financial assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition amounted to 0.42 per cent of the gross national product in 1995 and GNP and 0.44 per cent in 1996.	0
Portugal ratified the Convention on 21 December 1993 and submitted its first national communication on 25 January 1995.	0
review of the country's policies relevant to the Framework Convention on Climate Change cannot be undertaken without an understanding of the complex process of integration of the Portuguese economy into the EU and the Government's commitment to raise living standards towards the EU average.	0
The annual removal of CO2 was thus estimated at 29,718 Gg, rather than the 70,400 Gg reported in the national communication.	0
This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. 	1
The review team strongly recommended that such an effort be made for the second national communication due in April 1997, in particular in the energy, transport and industry sectors.	0

Other important measures which may impact on CO2 emissions from the energy sector include incentives for independent producers (i.e. small hydropower producers and other renewable sources) to generate electricity, which must be purchased by the recently restructured Eletricidade de Portugal.	0
Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. 	1
Portugal, as a participant in the Global Environment Facility (GEF), made a contribution in 1994 to the GEF pilot phase of 4.5 million SDR (special drawing rights), or roughly US$ 6.5 million.	0
Regarding climate change, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approached Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau to promote their active participation in the GEF, and similar contacts have been made with Angola and Mozambique.	0
Guidelines for the preparation of national communications and the process for their review were agreed on by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change, by its decisions 9/2 and 10/1, and by the Conference of the Parties, at its first session, by its decisions 2/CP.1 and 3/CP.1 (see FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1).	0
The in-depth review of the first national communication of Romania was carried out between October 1996 and April 1997 and included a country visit by the review team to Bucharest from 7 to 11 October 1996.	0
Romania relies on external investment to help upgrade plant and equipment, but foreign investment has been lower than expected, despite the low labour costs.	0
In that year, 2,328 Gg of CH4 were emitted, as were 67 Gg of N2O, 553 Gg of NOx, 2,337 Gg of CO and 529 Gg of NMVOCs.	0
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it? 	1
This is more or less what we saw last year, and this is how it will go on into the future. 	1
And this is GDP per capita on this axis. 	1
 But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year. 	1
The development of education on environmental issues has been listed in the first national communication as one of Romania's short-term objectives, to be achieved by including these issues in all levels of education and by facilitating public access to such information.	0
An environmental information and documentation office has developed a bibliographic database of publications on environmental issues.	0
This is India coming up, with the first data from India. 	1
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money. 	1
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here. 	1

There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money. 	1
These projections do not take into account the effects of any yet to be implemented special mitigation measures related to climate change, although they do include the effects of energy conservation measures of the Russian energy policy (not described in the communication) and an expected increase of the share of natural gas in total primary energy supply (TPES) from 40 per cent in 1990 to 54 per cent in 2000.	0
They are on the money side all the time. 	1
About 1957 here, the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines. 	1
There now, social benefits, social progress, are going ahead of economical progress. 	1
No sectoral breakdown of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion was made available.	0
Total N2O emissions of 820 Gg in 1990 were corrected during the in-depth review to 230 Gg.	0
Using 1994 IPCC global warming potentials (100-year time horizon), 1990 CO2 emissions (excluding land use change and forestry) represented 72 per cent of total GHG emissions, while methane accounted for 20 per cent.	0
The team advocates a more proactive role by the Interagency Commission of the Russian Federation on Climate Change (established in 1994) in increasing awareness of GHG issues and opportunities for cost-effective measures consistent with local development objectives among policy- and decision-makers in the Russian Federation, both at the federal and regional levels.	0
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story. 	1
During the review, the team had the opportunity to appreciate the high-quality work carried out by the Institute of Global Climate and Ecology.	0
Through the years, the scientific community in the Russian Federation and formerly in the Soviet Union have made invaluable contributions to research on climate change causes and impacts, including early active participation in the IPCC activities.	0
This really shows you, we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate. 	1
Policies and measures are reported in the national communication and are organized by gas and by sector, with a focus on the energy sector.	0
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed. 	1
Such improvements are feasible and cost-effective, as half of the electricity consumption is in 30 large units; the major barrier is the lack of capital.	0
Of these reductions, roughly 60 per cent is estimated to result from the use of non-fossil fuel sources, while energy savings, including efficiency gains from increased use of combined heat and power and shifts from high to low-carbon fossil fuels (mainly gas), contribute roughly 20 per cent.	0
We have to know a little more about the world. 	1
 But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious? 	1
The tasks of the SBI and the SBSTA are provided for under Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention.	0
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit. 	1
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing. 	1
Decision 6/CP.1 assigned responsibilities for aspects of this issue to both the SBI and the SBSTA, providing for consideration of policy aspects by the SBI and scientific and technical aspects by the SBSTA.	0
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean. 	1
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross. 	1
And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say, because that's what brings joy to life. 	1
These issues are not currently defined in the division of labour of the two subsidiary bodies.	0
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint, and I think I will convince you also by culture. 	1
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious. 	1
III. POSSIBLE ACTION BY THE SBI AND THE SBSTA	0
Can I request a moment of absolute silence? 	1
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. 	1
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight. 	1
This note provides a status report on four of the above topics, namely, an initial paper on terms of transfer, activities underway to develop a series of papers on adaptation technologies, activities related to technology centers and networks and the technology inventory.	0
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects. 	1
The secretariat is currently collecting information and preparing its first technical paper on this subject (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/TP.1).	0
In preparing the technical paper, the secretariat obtained financial information that differs in format among institutions.	0
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. 	1
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle. 	1
There are two primary targets we're doing here. 	1
There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide, halide, things like that. 	1
If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope. 	1
This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own. 	1
A second important aspect is the marked change in the composition of aid flows, for example the growing importance of emergency relief and peacekeeping activities OECD estimates that about 12 percent of all ODA is now devoted to emergency aid, compared with less than 2 percent in 1990.	0
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. 	1
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. 	1
However, the distribution of private flows is far from even with many low income countries continuing to rely on official development finance.	0
Developing countries are increasingly financing their infrastructure through international capital markets, a trend reflected in the growth of their commercial bank borrowing and their increased use of bond and equity markets.	0
E. Terms, conditions and financial criteria employed by multilateral lending institutions	0
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. 	1
Therefore, their terms and conditions vary significantly.	0
Least developed countries received the smallest amount of financing, but on average private capital flows increased by a factor of six, about the same as the increase to other countries.	0
The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. 	1
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater, to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit. 	1
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved. 	1
IV. TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION CENTERS AND NETWORKS	0
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human. 	1
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I'll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue. 	1
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on. 	1
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty, and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe. 	1
UNFCCC Expert Meeting on Adaptation Technologies	0
But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease. 	1
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically. 	1
One framework for classification of technology was presented at the meeting, which simply listed types of technologies (present, future, hard, soft) against areas of need organized by regions / sectors and by adverse processes.	0
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body, for tissues and for organs themselves. 	1
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate, but it's within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation. 	1
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body. 	1
In 2015, there will be 33 mega-cities, 27 in developing countries.	0
The greatest losses in human health could occur in the developing countries, as adaptive capabilities in those countries are much less than in developed countries, due to socio-economic and technological factors.	0
In order to cope with these problems, there is a need to develop and apply adaptive technologies, including integrated water management risk alert simulation models.	0
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later. 	1
SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE	0
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation, you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient. 	1
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100. 	1
Such a work plan should, inter alia, include a schedule for the preparation and distribution of the in-depth review for each Party, subject to modification in response to requests by the Parties concerned (see document FCCC/SBSTA/1997/4).	0
The present note contains a suggested outline schedule of the in-depth review of the second national communications from Annex I Parties based on the actual dates of the reviews of the first national communications.	0
Other reviews would be conducted "on paper" at the site of the secretariat; this would involve interaction with the Party concerned by telephone or by electronic means.	0
11. It may be noted that the cost to the Convention budget of a paper review would include travel by experts to the site of the secretariat; financial savings would arise in the travel of secretariat staff.	0
There may also be saving in expert travel costs of the same team of experts undertaking more than one paper review.	0
 Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president. 	1
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision, but together we can change his appetite. 	1
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty, and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well. 	1
Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms -- the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years. 	1
Proposed Programme Budget of the Convention for the Biennium 1998-1999	0
And the first thing that I want to talk about, the first thing I think we need to understand is: how do people respond to the epidemic? 	1
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent, if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress -- your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points. 	1
It's also important to think about what the benefit is. 	1
The essence of the approach is that the proposed work programme for 1998-1999 has been constructed from a zero base.	0
The only elements that can be compared thus are the overall staffing table of the secretariat and the total amount of resources sought.	0
This section provides a description of the resources that would be required to undertake additional work related to:	0
We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works. 	1
Annex III contains a summary of resource estimates for the coming biennium from all funding sources.	0
A total programme budget of $21,507,300 for the biennium 1998-1999, for the purposes listed in table 1 below (not including contingency itemsA post-Kyoto intergovernmental process and conference servicing.	0
A working capital reserve level of 8.3 per cent.	0
Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here -- this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt. 	1
I. Contribution from the host Government	0
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others. 	1
Budget requirements for the coming biennium have been calculated in anticipation of the reserve level being maintained at 8.3 per cent of expenditures in both years.	0
The assumed exchange rate is US$1 = DM 1.69.	0
These figures are listed in table 2 below.	0
a little bit on the increase later in the decade. 	1
Changes in any of the above assumptions may result in changes in the resources required in the Convention's core budget and/or trust funds for the biennium 1998-1999. Figure 1	0
III. PROPOSED BUDGET OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE BIENNIUM 1998-1999	0
The Executive Direction and Management (EDM) programme enables the Executive Secretary to provide overall direction and guidance to the secretariat, ensuring the coherence of the secretariat's activities, its proposals to Convention bodies and its advice to their officers.	0
I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new. 	1
What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities, these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet. 	1
Through three subprogrammes, it carries out the secretariat's work on technology (including its transfer and the analysis of related technical issues), methodology and science.	0
Table 5 S&T STAFFING REQUIREMENTS FROM THE CORE BUDGET	0
The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics, and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life. 	1
 "I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do." 	1
D. Acquisition of furniture/equipmentIncludes the resources necessary to meet estimated computer hardware and software needs for all staff and other uses covered by the core budget.	0
The next movement is called mobs. Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours. 	1
SECRETARIAT-WIDE RESOURCE NEEDS FROM THE CORE BUDGET	0
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll, and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected. 	1
The estimates for the current budget were made in early 1995, before experience had been acquired by the secretariat in servicing the Convention bodies and in operating in Bonn.	0
For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted" in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh. 	1
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected: "I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me." 	1
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project, the Yahoo! Time Capsule, which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006. 	1
In the event that the General Assembly decides not to include the needs of the UNFCCC in its regular budget for the biennium 1998-1999, the Parties would have to assume these costs within the Convention budget (see FCCC/SBI/1997/3, paras. 58-66).	0
In order to secure conference servicing which guarantees maximum flexibility and cost-effectiveness while at the same time preserving the quality of work expected of a body affiliated to the United Nations, it is proposed that conference servicing requirements are split into the following categories:	0
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again. 	1
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss, the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture. 	1
And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge. 	1
Costs have been calculated based on an average roundtrip fare between Paris/London/Vienna/ Geneva and Cologne.	0
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those. 	1
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton. 	1
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so. 	1
SUMMARY OF RESOURCE ESTIMATES FOR THE BIENNIUM 1998-1999	0
(a) The Executive Secretary should issue the provisional agenda for COP 3, including the annotations thereto and proposals for the organization of its work, at least six weeks before the opening of COP 3, that is, before the seventh session of the SBI;	0
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age, in years. 	1
And that's the process that I call task allocation. 	1
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active. 	1
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest, and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles. 	1
As stated in rule 21 of the draft rules of procedure, as applied, representatives shall be entitled to participate provisionally in the session, pending a decision by the COP to accept their credentials (CP/1996/2).	0
So there's this whole network of chambers. 	1
The SBI may wish to request the President of COP 2 to pursue informal consultations on the election of officers of COP 3.	0
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing. 	1
Thus the procedure for admission to the COP will apply to new applicants only.	0
In accordance with past practice, the SBI may request the Bureau of the COP to consider the list of applicants, prior to the third session, with a view to establishing that the organizations contained in the list do meet all requirements, and to authorize the secretariat to advise those applicants of their "pre-admittance status", on the understanding that the final authority for the admission of observers rests with the COP.	0
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger. 	1
In addition, there may be one or more addresses of welcome.	0
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down. 	1
In addition, the first plenary meeting will also take up a number of organizational matters: sub-items 2 (a) to (f) of the possible elements of the provisional agenda.	0
They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark, but they mostly work by smell. 	1
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing? 	1
The President may refer drafting tasks to informal groups, as appropriate.	0
And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?" 	1
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked. 	1
So here's some blue nest maintenance workers. 	1
So for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else -- the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food, they become foragers. 	1
Instead of the traditional general debate in plenary, ministers would be invited to make available written general statements which would be distributed to participants in COP 3, noted in its report and included in the Conference Web site.	0
At its fifth session, the SBI requested the secretariat "to propose arrangements for the communication of views by heads of United Nations programmes and agencies, IGOs and NGOs" (FCCC/1997/SBI/6, para. 44 (e)).	0
Instead, something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older. 	1
And we've learned that, in this species -- and I suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants, is different as ants perform different tasks. 	1
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons -- they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks. 	1
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance. 	1
It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways. 	1
(e) Statement by the Executive Secretary.	0
(a) Reports of the subsidiary bodies and matters arising:	0
MECHANISMS FOR CONSULTATIONS WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS	0
One thing we noticed with "The Sims," which is a game I did earlier, is that players love making stuff. 	1
The secretariat was unable to submit such a paper to the fourth or the fifth sessions of the SBSTA.	0
The subject of the paper was on the agenda of the fifth session, and deep regret at this delay was expressed.	0
The non-governmental community that participates in the Convention process is large, and diverse in its interests and opinions.	0
However, the secretariat has exercised its judgement in drawing upon the range of proposals and has supplemented that report by some further exchanges with non-governmental representatives.	0
There is clearly a common interest in all quarters of the non-governmental community to communicate their expertise and information to the Parties, as well as their "unfiltered" views on the range of political, socio-economic and technological issues that are addressed under the UNFCCC.	0
Some of these envisage the improvement of existing mechanisms for consultation and relate mainly to better access to the Convention process, while others seek to establish new mechanisms.	0
Currently, observers, including NGOs, are not given access to such meetings.	0
This would respond to the request for better access to the floor and to discussion, but not to the request for access to negotiations.	0
Really, this is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas, you know? 	1
The SBI may wish to consider whether it should encourage such action.	0
So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere, and so that's what I'm doing here. There's actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere, pressure and temperature. 	1
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere, we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you'll start noticing, we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time. 	1
So basically, what we're getting here is the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," in about two minutes, and that actually brings up an interesting point about games. 	1
So here's our little solar system, as we pull away from our melted planet here. 	1
The SBI is invited to express its views on this proposal.	0
Now as we pull away from this world -- we're going to keep pulling away from the star now. 	1
Prior to COP 1, NGOs were requested to reconfirm their interest in continuing to participate in the Convention process; this resulted in the removal of some inactive names from the list.	0
Nevertheless, the conditions for admitting NGOs remain minimal, consistent with Article 7.6, which states that " ... Any body or agency, whether national or international, governmental or non-governmental, which is qualified in matters covered by the Convention ..." may be admitted as an observer upon informing the secretariat of its wish to be represented.	0
Because if you think about it, you're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds, whatever, flying around this universe. 	1
Some of the questions which have arisen are:	0
It is reasonable to expect that a more systematic approach to consultation, such as is sought in different ways by the NGOs, will require a more solid structure.	0
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now, because I don't want to look at me on the screen. 	1
Some questions of principle have also been generated by these reflections, and are outlined below.	0
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood. 	1
For background to these questions, it may be noted that, of the nearly 240 NGOs currently accredited to participate in the Convention process, 55 per cent have addresses in States members of the European Community, 21 per cent in the USA, 15 per cent in other Annex II Parties and 9 per cent in developing countries.	0
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced. It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years. 	1
They cause different things to happen inside the cell. 	1
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly, from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes. 	1
And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty. 	1
This proposal was sent out in a note verbale dated 4 June 1997.	0

Note dated 28 May 1997 from the Embassy of the Azerbaijan Republic in the	0
On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning, Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee, Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature. 	1
That's like me telling you, "Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?" 	1
It further considers that the Third Conference of the Parties (COP III), to be held in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan will constitute an appropriate forum for the finalization of this demand.	0
3. The Republic of Azerbaijan wishes to stress that Turkey, though in complete agreement with the idea and understanding of the Convention, regrets not being able to sign the FCCC due to her inclusion in the annexes, as a "developed" country.	0
The text of this amendment should be added as a new paragraph after "Convention" in Article 17.1 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (article 17.1 (bis)).	0
The Parties shall make every effort to reach agreement on any proposed protocol to the Convention by consensus.	0

They're not going to wait for government to do things for them. 	1
(a) At their sixth sessions, the SBI and the SBSTA both recommended for adoption by the COP at its third session the decision contained in annex II to this document.	0
(f) The SBI requested the secretariat to submit, at its next session, a report on progress achieved so far in returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol and projected emissions by sources and removals by sinks of such gases in the year 2000 by each Annex I Party, on the basis of its national communication; and	0
(c) The SBI invited Parties to submit further views on these matters by 8 September 1997 and requested the secretariat to compile these submissions. These will be made available at the next session of the SBI to facilitate consideration of a draft decision for submission to COP 3. V. FINANCIAL MECHANISM: REVIEW PROCESS REFERRED	0
Statements were made by the representatives of five Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States.	0
There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. 	1
It had before it a document presented by the secretariat (FCCC/SBI/1997/12).	0
At its 5th meeting, on 5 August, having considered a proposal by the Chairman, the SBI recommended for adoption by the COP at its third session the decision contained in annex IV to this document.	0
All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors. 	1
The SBI took note of the comments expressed by the Parties on the date and venue for COP 4 and recommended the decision contained in annex V to this document for adoption by the COP at its third session.	0
If you look into their traditional systems, Africans organize their states in two types. 	1
The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous, so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority. 	1
At its 4th meeting on 30 July, having considered a proposal by the Chairman, the SBI took note of the information provided by the secretariat.	0

(a) Assisting the Conference of the Parties with reviewing the progress of the activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase, on the basis of inputs by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice.	0
Like in every other country where this has been done, jobs is the top issue. 	1
Authorizes the Executive Secretary to make transfers, between each of the main appropriation lines set out in Table 1, up to an aggregate limit of 15 per cent of total estimated expenditure for those appropriation lines, provided that a further limitation of up to minus 25 per cent of each such appropriation line shall apply;	0
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive. 	1
The issue is how are we using what has been given back. 	1
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was looking at people and giving them meds. 	1
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning -- and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back. 	1

ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FOURTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES	0
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy. 	1
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU -- got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU? 	1
Resources that were transferred to them -- and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No! 	1
4. Financial mechanism: Review process referred to in decision 9/CP.1.	0
7. Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings.	0
Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that and the EU. 	1
The scheduling of meetings for the session will be based on the availability of facilities during normal working hours when services are available for one meeting with interpretation from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. There will also be some facilities for informal meetings without interpretation.	0
But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic, we would have failed. 	1
4. Financial mechanism: Review process referred to in decision 9/CP.1	0
They don't shy away from infrastructure. 	1
He said, "There are two things you need only. 	1
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms, to enable people to take risk? 	1
The secretariat will inform the SBI of any such offer received.	0
In response to this request, the Executive Secretary will prepare the note contained in document FCCC/SBI/1997/18.	0
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company. 	1
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates. 	1
CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights? 	1
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts. 	1
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment, and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say. 	1
It also contains a brief report on programme delivery, and explanatory notes on areas where the actual levels of expenditure have differed significantly from the levels approved by the COP (see section II).	0
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle. 	1
As of 31 August 1997, contributions to the UNFCCC core budget trust fund amounted to $10,386,691, or 75 per cent of the biennial total.	0
Africa was being used as a success story! 	1
You should have seen my parents' reaction! 	1
 But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa, in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt. 	1
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle, and it foretold his destiny of greatness. 	1
So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers. 	1
A total of 147 Parties attended, in addition to 14 observer States and 135 observer organizations (including both intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations).	0
It also is the second most populated continent, with 900 million people. 	1
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States, China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space. 	1
Nigeria: a similar situation, from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits. 	1
Regarding national communications, the programme has continued to conduct in-depth reviews of first national communications from Annex I Parties and publish reports.	0
So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa. 	1
Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense. 	1
6. Intergovernmental and Information Support (IIS) programme	0
Because it is actually a long-term play. 	1
During this reporting period, the Intergovernmental and Information Support (IIS) programme has managed all aspects relating to the organization of four official sessions of the Convention bodies.	0
These activities have become more resource-intensive since August 1996, given the physical distance between Bonn and the provider of conference services in Geneva, the limited availability of suitable conference facilities, and the number of sessions scheduled in 1997.	0
Conference-related activities have been funded from a combination of sources: support costs have been covered from the core fund, while facility costs have been covered from the Bonn Fund (see paragraphs 44-47).	0
Expenditures relating to the I+P programme have exceeded earlier forecasts by 45 per cent.	0
The COP at its first session (COP 1) decided that a working capital reserve should be maintained within the Trust Fund for the Core Budget (see decision 15/CP.1, annex I, para. 14).	0
III. TRUST FUND FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE UNFCCC PROCESS	0
The current eligibility criterion for receiving support is that a Party’s per capita gross domestic product was $5,500 or less in 1994.	0
Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices. 	1
An overview of this contribution, which is referred to as the “Bonn Fund”, is contained in table 6 of document FCCC/SBI/1997/INF.7.	0
As a result of DM1,000,000 being deferred to 1997 and the contribution for participation increasing to DM630,000, the contribution for the year ultimately amounted to DM1,870,000.	0
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties. 	1

INVENTORIES OF ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS OF GREENHOUSE GASES FOR 1990 TO 1995 21 - 32 7	0
Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow. 	1
For the majority of reporting Parties PFC emissions were substantially lower in 1995 in comparison to 1990.	0
Emissions of HFCs have increased significantly since 1990, with many Parties remarking on the increasing use of HFCs as replacements for ozone-depleting substances.	0
It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris. 	1
I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah. 	1
 Like, what have I got to say about all this? 	1
Agriculture was the largest (39 per cent) source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, followed by industrial processes (35 per cent in 1990, 32 per cent in 1995) and fuel combustion (22 per cent in 1990, 26 per cent in 1995).	0
The fastest growing source of CO2 emissions for the majority of Parties was transport, where emissions were increasing even for some of those Parties which in 1995 registered lower levels of total CO2 emissions than in 1990.	0
In general, the quality of the inventory data presented in the second national communications was higher than in the first communications, but some problems which hamper reporting of GHG inventories in a transparent, complete and consistent manner still exist.	0
And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity." 	1
The spectrum of policies and measures employed by reporting Parties includes economic instruments, particularly taxes, regulations, information, education and raising public awareness.	0
Voluntary approaches figured predominantly in a number of second communications.	0
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light. 	1
And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language, and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe": same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven," and one means "bicycle" or "iron." 	1
Thirteen Parties, accounting for 45 per cent of the aggregated Annex I inventory figures for 1990, projected stabilization or decreases in CH4 emissions compared to their base years.	0
It can only be understood in the context of story, and everything, all of this is story. 	1
We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here. 	1
When all projected emissions (excluding land-use change and forestry) are totalled using IPCC-1995 GWPs, nine of the reporting Parties projected an increase for 2000.	0
So, what it says to me then is that it's not really -- the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told, the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story, and that's really what it's all about. 	1
However, owing to time constraints and late submissions of some of the second national communications it was not possible to cover the subjects to the same degree of detail as in the previous report.	0
 This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria, was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa, with the Hausa being Harry. 	1
The trend in CO2 emissions from transport was practically homogenous among Parties.	0
For Switzerland and Finland, emissions apparently fluctuated around levels of 1990, and for Slovakia, although a downward trend was evident in the years immediately following 1990, in recent years emissions have begun to rise.	0
I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff. 	1
My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it. 	1
For half of the reporting Parties the energy and transformation industries accounted for 53.4 per cent (Czech Republic) to 33.0 per cent (Netherlands) of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.	0
The share of the transport sector ranged from 50.5 per cent (Norway) to 7.1 per cent (Czech Republic).	0
These higher CO2 emissions in the industrial processes category are apparently due to the fact that emissions from the iron and steel industry were included in this category, not in fuel combustion as is usually the case.	0
For the majority of Parties total CO2 emissions in 1995 were higher than in 1990, with increases ranging from 2 to 10 per cent.	0
To be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying, but to say in that moment, as Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her." 	1
African narratives in the West, they proliferate. 	1
I have been human six days, but only sometimes." 	1
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth, that I had challenged my students in America -- I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots." 	1
The trends in CH4 emissions for 1990 to 1995 varied by source and Party.	0
Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it. 	1
Agriculture accounted in 1995 for the largest share, 39.3 per cent, of the aggregate N2O emissions of the reporting Parties, followed by industrial processes, 31.8 per cent and fuel combustion, 26.3 per cent.	0
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet. 	1
And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage, shaped like five bowstrings. 	1
CH4 and N2O accounted for 11 per cent and 4 per cent of total emissions, while emissions of HFCs, PFCs and SF6 taken together were 1.8 per cent of total emissions.	0
In general, polices and measures in the second communications were reported in a clearer manner than in the first ones.	0
It might be advisable to develop some criteria for reporting policies and measure in national communications, which on the one hand would limit their number to a manageable optimum, and on the other hand would highlight those measures which make a substantial contribution to national climate change policies.	0
The FCCC guidelines, inter alia, establish that the elements listed above should be set out in a uniform policies and measures summary table.	0
The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors, the engineers, the civil servants -- those are the leaders. 	1
Annual statistics are referred to as the most common indicator of intermediate progress.	0
We had just had a military coup, and soldiers were pervasive in our society. 	1
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father, and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building, I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons. 	1
Now, I was 16. I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill. 	1
It was important not to look at those guns. 	1
But I learned something more profound than that, which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy -- were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse. 	1
And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before. 	1
Some Parties indicated that competition in electricity generation decreases the attractiveness of large central power stations, which may imply less coal burning and CO2 emissions, but also less nuclear power with its low GHG emissions profile.	0
That the state of the world -- the state of the world depends on what's happening to Africa, as far as my kids would be concerned. 	1
The level of these estimated sectoral reductions does not increase significantly between 2000 and 2010.	0
Education and technical assistance, building code regulations and standards for efficiency-related labelling of products are also among the most common measures.	0
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code, and if so, what it should look like. 	1
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible. 	1
Support for proposed EU increases in minimum mineral oil taxes was included in measures listed by some Parties (e.g. AUT, DEU).	0
Across the range of communications, both the measures reported and the monitoring data provided illustrate the difficulties that Parties face in dealing with transport emissions.	0
It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students. 	1
Other measures related to fugitive fuel emissions concentrate on reducing leaks in natural gas distribution and storage systems (e.g. CAN, GBR, IRE, NLD), largely through voluntary means.	0
Most of the Parties, except Canada and Ireland, project reduced CH4 emissions in 2000 compared with 1990 levels.	0
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be. 	1
In three Parties, the reductions are expected to result from a measure to limit N2O emissions from adipic acid manufacturing.	0
So then I went the whole American way, with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed, but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way. 	1
It features voluntary approaches with HFC-23 and primary aluminium producers to develop and implement favourable processing practices or technology and regulatory mechanisms to limit the use of HFCs and PFCs where alternatives are available.	0
IV. PROJECTIONS AND EFFECTS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES	0
In three cases (CHE, NLD, SWE), such differences also reflect the use of adjustments.	0
In some cases, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, one of these scenarios corresponded to “implemented measures” and the other, with more substantial emission reductions, to measures “under consideration”.	0
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service, and who really know the markets. 	1
Reporting on assumptions improved substantially compared with the firstnational communications.	0
In general, the description of the assumptions and approaches used to project the emissions of other GHGs has also improved.	0
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs, in A to Z manufacturing company. 	1
Canada also presented detailed information on how the assumptions, expert assessment and sectoral models feed into the evaluation of the main model for the estimation of emissions.	0
C. Projections for 2000-2020 and overall effects of measures	0
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free. 	1
We can start building local distribution, and actually, it can cost the public sector much less." 	1
Only Finland (in one of the presented scenarios) and Germany projected decreases in the longer term.	0
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true. 	1
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success. 	1
And most of all, most of all, it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience, whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African, local or diaspora, left or right, to really start listening to each other. 	1
For nine Parties net CO2 removals in 2000 were projected to increase; among them was the United Kingdom, for which the removal by forests is offset by other emissions in the land-use change and forestry category.	0
Some Parties included quantitative estimates of mitigation impact for all measures for 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020.	0
The effects of policies and measures on other GHG emissions were reported by three Parties (DEU, GBR, USA).	0
 But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something, that bud is a young one. 	1
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated. 	1
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine, although they're part and parcel of our African reality, they are not the only reality. 	1
This range reflects uncertainties about the ultimate impact of action to liberalize electricity markets and investments in research, development and demonstration for new technologies.	0
France: the preliminary second national communication did not contain estimates of the effects of policies and measures.	0
The second study only considers energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.	0
Three different GDP growth scenarios are provided and these data are taken from the medium growth scenario. “With measures” projections are provided for other energy-related greenhouse gases, but the effects of policies and measures are not explicitly identified.	0
Switzerland: estimates were based on bottom-up energy forecasts models and draw a distinction between implemented measures and measures under consideration.	0
The percentage figure included in table 6 indicates the extent to which policies and measures are expected to reduce emissions below 1990 levels in 2000, other things being equal.	0
Of course, other things do change (e.g., population, GDP) and these changes sometimes tend to offset the CO2 emission reductions generated by policies and measures, as discussed in section IV. (c).	0
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba. 	1
And all forms of intervention need support, the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth, the kinds of institutions that increase productivity. 	1
A similar trend is evident with respect to CH4 emissions.	0
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial, they need really to have the army clobber the opposition. 	1
It was not however possible to draw conclusions from these data, since Parties often found it difficult to separate the impact of regulatory and voluntary programmes directed at energy efficiency improvements.	0
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy, it lies with international donors. 	1
The reporting guidelines also state that, wherever possible, Parties should report on the effects of individual policies and measures on GHG emissions.	0
Most Parties provided an estimate of the effect of at least a few individual policies and measures on GHG emissions.	0
As indicated in this table, the reduction of CO2 emission accounts for the largest percentage over time. It is, however, less than the 80 per cent proportion of CO2 emissions in 1990 for reporting Parties.	0
The impact of these measures is evidenced primarily over time as equipment, buildings and other capital stock is turned over.	0
All Parties, except Canada and Monaco, provided estimates for the ozone precursors, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and NMVOC, although in varying degrees of detail.	0
But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments, but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure. 	1
One hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies, all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing, this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this. 	1
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits. 	1
This comparison is requested by the IPCC guidelines but not all Parties followed them.	0
For 11 out of 17 reporting Parties, estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion for 1990 were within 5 per cent of the recent estimates made by the International Energy Agency (IEA)International Energy Agency, CO2 emissions from fuel consumption, 1997 edition (forthcoming).	0
Right? It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot. 	1
However, once the CO2 emissions from international aviation bunkers are excluded from the IEA data for all reporting Parties and the emissions from feedstocks are included in the fuel combustion category for those six Parties (in line with a top-down approach), all the estimates fall within 5 per cent of the IEA data.	0
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy. 	1
But secondly, I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed. 	1
Nevertheless, the data are more complete than in the first national communications, especially in the industrial processes category.	0
There'd be virtually no learning curve. 	1
The lower level of reporting of CO2 emissions from iron and steel, non-ferrous metals and inorganic chemicals categories is apparently due to the fact that many Parties reported these emissions in the fuel combustion category.	0
Eight Parties (BEL, CAN, CZE, GBR, NLD, NZL, SLO, USA) provided quantitative information on levels of uncertainty, either on a gas-by-gas basis or at the source/sink category level as requested by the FCCC guidelines.	0
This resulted in improved information compared to the first national communications.	0
The Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), at its fourth session decided that, to ensure comparability, Parties should recalculate the base year inventory and inventories for any subsequent years when using the 1996 IPCC revised guidelines.	0
This influence depends on the shares of individual GHGs in the total emissions.	0
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. 	1
Data were provided by 15 Parties, although assumptions sometimes differed.	0
In general, Parties classified the confidence level of these estimates as medium.	0
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused. Right? 	1
The differences between GWP values for different types of HFC and PFC species are large.	0
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida, but there's no California! 	1
He's a director of an electroplating company. 	1
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes. 	1
And the Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors. 	1
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically. 	1
To date, 59 Parties (32 non-Annex I, 18 Annex II and 9 Annex I Parties with economies in transition) have nominated 205 national experts (109 non-Annex I, 67 Annex II and 39 Annex I with economies in transition) to participate in the in-depth reviews.	0
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough. 	1
At present, the secretariat is finalizing preparations for the reviews of second national communications from Annex I Parties, including updating the list of experts nominated by governments for participation in in-depth reviews.	0
From the perspective of capacity building, participation in the in-depth reviews proved to be a useful experience for the experts from non-Annex I Parties.	0
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore. 	1
However, as can be seen from the numbers mentioned in paragraph 11, such participation was limited.	0
And we can start a film about that, and we can see a little bit backwards in time. 	1

He urged delegates to make efficient use of the time allocated and to conclude the negotiations in a timely manner.	0
Reviewing certain matters on the SBI agenda, he stressed the need of developing countries for support in preparing their initial national communications and in strengthening national capacities to address climate change.	0
The Executive Secretary made known his strong concern at the delays in contributions to the core budget for the current biennium, including from some major contributors, and also appealed for further contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in time for COP 3.	0
(Agenda item 2) The SBI considered this item at its 1st meeting, on 20 October.	0
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal. 	1
This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere. 	1
Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp, have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are, where we've come from and the times we live in. 	1

9. Administrative and financial matters.	0
The Vice-Chairman informed the SBI that applications for observer status from three intergovernmental and 21 non-governmental organizations had been screened by the secretariat on the basis of the provisions of Article 7.6 of the Convention and in accordance with the procedures established by the COP for the admission of organizations (see document FCCC/SB/1997/INF.4).	0
The SBI considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 5th meetings, on 21 and 29 October respectively.	0
The SBI took note of the report of the secretariat on the progress made in the review of the first national communications from Annex I Parties and in the submission of second national communications.	0
 There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture. 	1
The SBI considered this sub-item at its 1st and 5th meetings, on 20 and 29 October respectively.	0
Statements were made by representatives of eight Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States.	0
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution, the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack, because any kind of aggression will be punished, leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first. 	1
And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for. 	1
The SBSTA and the SBI decided to forward this synthesis report to the Conference of the Parties for its consideration.	0
The SBSTA invited Parties participating in the pilot phase of activities implemented jointly to note that the deadline for the submission of reports to be taken into account in the synthesis report for the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties was 30 June 1998.	0
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about, that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology, by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth? 	1
VII. ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS	0
Statements were made by representatives of 12 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States and one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.	0
For example, the dative construction in English. 	1
You can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative. 	1
It further requested the secretariat to advise the SBI on the elements in other United Nation procedures which could be relevant to the development of procedures on the participation of non-governmental organizations in the Convention process.	0
XI. LEGAL MATTERS: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT	0
In closing the session, the Chairman noted that this was his last meeting as Chairman of the SBI.	0
Division of labour between the Subsidiary Body for Implementationand the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice 15	0
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think, from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs. 	1
Arrangements for administrative support to the Convention secretariat 32	0
Having considered the recommendations made by the Chairmen, through the conclusions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation, as included in the reports of their sixth sessions,	0
(a) The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will be the link between the scientific, technical and technological assessments and the information provided by competent international bodies, and the policy-oriented needs of the Conference of the Parties;	0
Likewise, we use "force" to indicate not only physical force, as in, "Rose forced the door to open," but also interpersonal force, as in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her, but by issuing a threat. 	1
(d) As stipulated in the Convention, and as decided by the Conference of the Parties in decision 6/CP.1, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will have responsibility for providing advice on all scientific, technological and methodological aspects of the development and transfer of technology;	0
So the puzzle is, why are bribes, polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled? 	1
Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999	0
In the workplace, for example, there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss, or refer to him or her If two friends have a reciprocal transaction, like selling a car, it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. 	1
Well, language, as a social interaction, has to satisfy two conditions. 	1
3. Approves a contingency budget for conference servicing, amounting to US$ 5,184,900, to be added to the programme budget for the coming biennium in the event that the General Assembly of the United Nations decides not to provide resources for these activities in the regular United Nations budget for the biennium 1998-1999 (see table 3 below);	0

One of the things I'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about. 	1
I don't know how many of you might imagine it, but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq. 	1
According to the GEF Quarterly Operational Report of March 1997, the GEF has provided over $US 528 million in grant financing for climate change projects and project preparation.	0
Information is available on the GEF work programme allocations, commitments and disbursements.	0
The total amount available for climate change project financing was thus $US 3,258 million.	0
Further regional workshops have been scheduled for 1997.	0
Procedures for obtaining funding and the level of funding obtainable should be clearly indicated.	0
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad. 	1
The allocation of funding to regions was seen to be imbalanced.	0
In this context an explicit request was made to the SBI that the necessary steps are taken to formally operationalise paragraph 2(a) of decision 11/CP.1.	0

And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me, that then became my story, was -- for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler -- it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents, where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed. 	1
In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed. 	1

I hugged him, of course, and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK." 	1
We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason. 	1
In response to the requests of the COP and the SBSTA, the secretariat engaged the Free University in the Netherlands to undertake the preparation of a technical paper on adaptation technologies (FCCC/TP/1997/3).	0
It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity. 	1
In addition, the initial draft was sent to participants in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) workshop on adaptation held in the Netherlands between 21-22 March, 1997.	0
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity," I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine. 	1
However, many institutions are already engaged in making autonomous adjustments, without explicitly recognizing the link to climate change, or the need to consider climate change as a criteria for decision.	0
Other aspects of adaptation may include economic, legal and institutional measures.	0
It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching." 	1
What if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?" 	1
Technologies could be used now and could play an increasingly important part in adaptation to climate change.	0
Examples of existing adaptation technologies include air conditioning, flood-defence systems, irrigation, monitoring, forecasting and early warning systems for natural hazards.	0
I'm at this place called the Media Lab. 	1
Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man. 	1
In view of the suggested discernible human influence on global climate and in accordance with Article 3.3 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), anticipatory planned adaptation deserves particular attention from the international climate change community.	0
Fragmented industries, such as those that are not part of a larger network of governmental and industrial organizations and human health programmes may also benefit.	0
The arguments in favour of implementing some adaptation measures now are as follows:	0
So often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor. 	1
(c) Co-operating with research laboratories and industry to encourage research and development of adaptation technology;	0
And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing. 	1

It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up. 	1

So, this is sort of a complication I've found. 	1
Recently, the International Environmental Technology Centre (IETC) at UNEP launched one such system at the fifth session of the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD), held in New York from 7 to 25 April 1997.	0
The newly developed Searchable Information Directory on Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) called “maESTro”, through its Directory Interchange Format (DIF), is fully compatible with UNEP’s Global Resources Information Database (GRID), the database of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) and others.	0

He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now. 	1
For users in countries not yet actively participating, telephone and fax service is provided and sets of information are distributed in hard copies (FCCC/TP/1997/4).	0
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary. 	1
The GREENTIE database could be opened up to non-OECD information sources and users that meet agreed criteria. This might be accomplished at relatively low cost, perhaps in the range of 100-250 k (US$), but would need to be done on a multilateral basis.	0
And in parallel at that time, there was a very kind of exclusive design club. 	1
And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here, finally connects with the physical world, there is the reality that that has become humanized, so that digital world has all the friendliness, all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world. 	1
However, one way to share this expertise is to improve linkages between institutions.	0
Buildings are important, but they're only a component of a much bigger picture. 	1
There are many ways these linkages can be improved.	0
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back and we look at planet Earth, and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society, then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry. 	1
The scope of such a centre would need careful consideration.	0
Such a centre could also focus, initially, on providing only a few services like identifying sources and collecting and synthesizing information.	0
In this regard, options could include co-location with another international organization, such as, the Ozone Action Information Clearing-house (OAIC) of the UNEP or a national institution having complementary capabilities.	0
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city, is not dense compared with the really dense cities. 	1
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace. 	1
National centres can be a complement to and an important user of information from an international centre(s).	0
How does it affect the design of buildings? 	1
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature. 	1
These “centres” are typically equipped with personal computers, printers, a modem, a fax machine and a consultant.	0
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow. 	1
In 2001, this building received an award. 	1
(f) Local government information and meeting space.	0
These could include, providing a place where people in the community can become familiar with information and communication technology, increasing skill levels in the local business and community, and advising businesses and organizations on how to access information on technologies.	0
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate, would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads. 	1
Well, obviously the building still happened. 	1
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here. 	1
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light -- electric light, which in turn creates more heat, which creates more cooling loads and so on. 	1
At its fifth session, the SBSTA recalled the need as expressed in decision 7/CP.2 to evaluate the use of the roster of experts in facilitating the work of the Convention secretariat, taking into account the ongoing discussion on ITAPs.	0
It took note of the plans of the secretariat to make use of the roster for preparing reports on technology and technology transfer by, inter alia, the seventh session.	0
(b) Recall its intention to expand the roster to include experts in the field of methodologies as provided for at its fourth session and, in so doing, urge the secretariat to seek additional nominees with methodological expertise from Parties, reflecting the priority areas in the work programme;	0
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky. 	1
In response to decision 7/CP.2, the secretariat sent on 22 August 1996 a letter to Parties requesting the nomination of experts to be included in a roster on technology transfer.	0
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons. 	1
There is an evolution here between the projects, and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London. 	1
It has also used the experts to review, via electronic means, technical papers on adaptation (TP/1997/3), temperature adjustments (TP/1997/4) and activities of Parties included in Annex II related to technology transfer (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/13).	0
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline, a pipe, sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried, that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea. 	1
(b) A review of the roster to identify experts with the required scientific and regional backgrounds;	0
In the future, the secretariat will try to ensure adequate participation by issuing invitations earlier and, within the budgetary possibilities, by inviting several more experts than would be strictly necessary.	0
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable. 	1
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas -- it's like four pieces of a puzzle. 	1

Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do. 	1
In accordance with the criteria for reporting under the AIJ pilot phase, this synthesis reflects only those AIJ for which reports have been received, either jointly or separately, from all designated national authorities (DNA) of Parties participating in an activity as indicated in annex IV of document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8.	0
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about. 	1
Three AIJ of the 39 considered in this synthesis were only reported as accepted, approved or endorsed. Of the 39 AIJ, 25 were reported in accordance with the Uniform Reporting Format (URF) adopted by the SBSTA at its fifth session in March 1997, and 11 AIJ, submitted prior to that adoption, in accordance with the initial reporting framework.	0
Twelve Parties submitted reports on national programmes for AIJ under the pilot phase in 1997, twice as many as in 1996.	0
With stricter reporting standards in effect, duly endorsed reports for consideration in the synthesis report were submitted on 39 activities, involving 11 countries.	0
Yet, even though this is a limited base for drawing conclusions, a gradual expansion of activities which meet all AIJ and reporting criteria is discernible.	0
Since many programmes and activities are at an early stage, most Parties are still in the process of gaining experience.	0
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. 	1
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall. 	1
A more significant effect would, however, be achievable through the replication of such projects;	0
This variability in reporting quality may be due to the relatively short time available to Parties for preparing the reports in accordance with the URF and/or the possible lack of guidance as to the level of detail expected.	0
So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there. 	1
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language? 	1
Eleven Parties state that emission reductions, and, in that context, baseline calculations, must be verifiable.	0
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else. 	1
So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power, so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running. 	1
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. 	1
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups. 	1
However, no detailed standard information regarding the role and activities of the participants is available.	0
It may be noted that two Parties have cooperated in a significant number of activities showing a pattern of replication: six activities in energy efficiency (mainly improvement of municipal/district heating systems) and 12 activities in renewable energy (conversion to bio-fuel boilers).	0

We had AirDynamisis, who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big, many year project, and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew. 	1
Other Parties reported a continuation in present trends, for example, assuming declining carbon stocks or unsustainable energy consumption patterns.	0
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back, and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt, and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight, which had then been around for --  -- 17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds, which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars. 	1
But that began thinking about how birds went around, and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly, and then other planes, and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged, was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place, but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider, 	1
And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that. 	1
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense, but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field. 	1
But while this was going on, in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation -- their annual prize -- and I had to prepare a paper on it, which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years. 	1
G. Contribution to capacity building, transfer of environmentally sound	0
Generally all reports mentioned that the activity, in one form or the other, contributed to capacity building, transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how.	0
Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve. 	1
And they form little groups, all fighting with each other, and when I leave, two hours later, most of them are saying about 2 billion people, and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion, nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem. 	1
In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses, a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. 	1
The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff. 	1
Any observations and comments received by 1 October 1997 will be compiled and made available for consideration at the seventh sessions of the SBSTA and the SBI, in accordance with the mandate of the COP to draw on the roster of experts.	0
First, it is limited by the fact that the activities of some Annex II Parties (AUT, DNK, ZZZ, GRC, ITA, JPN, LUX, PRT, ESP) have not been considered because their second national communications were not submitted in time to contribute to this note.	0
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions. 	1
Because, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen. 	1
And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. 	1
These projects fall into four categories, three defined as long-term operational programmes such as energy efficiency, renewable energy and reducing the long-term costs of low greenhouse gas emitting technologies.	0
For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual, it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself. 	1
These projects focus on efforts to improve energy efficiency in building construction, lighting, electric power generation and industrial boilers.	0
Eighteen projects have received approximately 33% of GEF funding to support the removal of barriers to the use of renewable energy.	0
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption. 	1
In Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals, and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat. 	1
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world. 	1
And unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube, you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones. 	1
As we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized? 	1
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines, the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today, the next decades will see rising sea levels. 	1
Two other Parties (FRA, DEU) included their financial contribution to the World Bank in a larger number outlining their financial contribution to a number of multilateral institutions.	0
This is the difficulty that one country faces. 	1
Last year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world. 	1
20 years ago, there were three and a half million. 	1
Two Parties (FIN, DEU) provided some examples of the expected greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with particular bilateral climate change related projects.	0
Six Parties (FIN, FRA, DEU, NLD, SWE, USA) also indicated that their bilateral assistance included cross-sectoral “country study” type programmes.	0
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness. 	1
1. Finland has indicated that aside from what is reported in this table, it has provided bilateral financial transfers to Eastern European countries to prevent transboundary air and water pollution.	0
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey. 	1
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be. 	1
It is not clear if this assistance is climate-related or which sectors receive the funding.	0
The region receiving the largest portion of bilateral financial assistance in the 1994-1995 period is Asia and the Pacific with a percentage of 58.86 of the total.	0
The eight Parties that provided the standard reporting tables for bilateral financial assistance indicated that this assistance was distributed to 83 different countries in the 1994-1995 period.	0
Only one Party (USA) provides a substantive discussion of activities undertaken by the private sector that have transferred technologies that will help non-Annex II Parties mitigate or adapt to climate change.	0
It's a condensable in the atmosphere, and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK, and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze, which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface. 	1
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. 	1
But we couldn't make sense of our images, until, six months after we got into orbit, an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan. 	1
The remaining Parties all included at least one partially completed table for each of their multilateral and bilateral financial contributions.	0
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan. 	1
The Parties that reported on their financial contributions to specific multilateral institutions and programmes usually provided their entire contribution, whether or not it was used for purposes related to the aims of the Convention.	0
It seems that some Parties were unclear, however, about what financial contributions should be reported.	0
Third, the issue of “new and additional” financial contributions seemed to pose a challenge to Parties.	0
My team and I have examined images like this, and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini. 	1

 RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which -- CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we -- it was a TEDster event there, I think. 	1
These documents contained reports prepared by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on the monitoring of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and on the International Conference on the World Climate Research Programme, as requested by the SBSTA at its fourth and fifth sessions.	0
At the 3rd meeting, on 24 October, statements were made by the Chairman and the Chairman Emeritus of the IPCC, both of whom also responded to questions.	0
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but -- CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about -- RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola, and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy" and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson. 	1
Two informal meetings were organized with the IPCC on the Third Assessment Report (TAR) and on Technical Paper 4 on Implications of Proposed CO2 Emissions Limitations, on 23 and 28 October, respectively.	0
Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place. 	1
(e) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the reports provided by the WMO in response to its requests at its fourth and fifth sessions, which covered the following subjects:	0
(i) Monitoring of GHGs in the atmosphere;	0
RB: Yeah? No, he is a -- CA: Well, some people found it wonderful, some people found it completely bizarre. 	1
The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st and 3rd meetings, on 20 and 24 October respectively.	0
At its 3rd meeting, on 24 October, having considered a proposal by the Chairman, the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions:	0
And, I mean, first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before, so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream, and we weren't quite sure, when a balloon actually got into the jet stream, whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there. 	1
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time, and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped, and left me holding on for dear life. 	1
(e) The SBSTA forwarded to the SBI a text for inclusion as operative paragraph 1 of a draft decision on this sub-item to be recommended by the SBI for adoption by the COP at its third session (for the text of the draft decision, see document FCCC/SBI/1997/21, annex I).	0
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone, the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ... 	1
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds, and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over. 	1
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing. 	1
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying, you know, come on, Richard, there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic. 	1
At its 4th meeting, on 28 October, having considered a proposal made by the Chairman on the basis of inputs from a joint working group established by the SBSTA and the SBI, the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions:	0
The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 21 and 28 October, respectively.	0
(a) The SBSTA took note with appreciation of the document prepared by the secretariat on activities of Parties included in Annex II related to transfer of technology (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/13), which was based on second national communications.	0
CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life. 	1
It had before it the following documents: FCCC/SBSTA/1997/11 and FCCC/SBSTA/1997/INF.6.	0
At its 4th meeting, on 28 October, having considered a proposal made by the Chairman, the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions:	0
And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides. 	1
RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids, you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm. 	1
Statements were made by representatives of 22 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and another speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States.	0

1. Co-operation with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change	0
Reaffirming its decision 6/CP.2, paragraph 5, in which it urged continuing co-operation between the Convention bodies and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),	0
RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important, so from the time the kids were very young, you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them. 	1
And I think it's important that the individuals, who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars, but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world. 	1
Noting the role of the public and private sectors in developing and disseminating environmentally sound and economically viable technologies related to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change,	0
Having considered the progress reports presented by the Convention secretariat on the development and transfer of technology,	0
1. Reaffirms decisions 13/CP.1 and 7/CP.2 on transfer of technology;	0
(b) To consult with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other relevant international organizations, and solicit information on their capabilities and abilities to support the work of (an) international technology information centre(s), as well as national and regional centres, and to enhance support for national and regional centres, and to report to the SBSTA and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) on its findings; and	0
So, for instance, there's a doctor in Africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant, that the baby will not have HIV when it's born. 	1
CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic. 	1
3. Adopts the uniform reporting format contained in FCCC/SBSTA/1997/4, and invites Parties to report in accordance with that format and to provide inputs to the secretariat on their experience in using it, so that, if necessary, changes can be incorporated.	0
- Timely dissemination of reports in print and via electronic mail (where available);	0
And that may be a selfish thing to think, but it's the way I've been brought up. 	1
- Inclusion of an index in the TAR in order to facilitate its use;	0
- Improve assessment by narrowing the range of uncertainties and indicating the limitations of results;	0
50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy. 	1
I mean, it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases, you're still doing these incredible new plans. 	1

So I would like to thank you for that inspiration, and for coming to TED today. Thank you. 	1

And some of the watches there, attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding. 	1
That to be able to talk about content, to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise, elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us. 	1
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house, because everybody's always, you know, leaving, they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail, and he runs to the other room. 	1
I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy, the same kind of love of language. 	1
The Chairman of the SBSTA, Mr. Tibor Faragó, opened the session on 25 February 1997.	0
He welcomed all delegates and observers from non-parties, United Nations bodies and organizations, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.	0
He also noted that limited options had been available for the choice of venue, and as a result, at the current session, it had been necessary to set up temporary facilities for some meetings.	0
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true. 	1
At its 1st meeting, on 25 February, the SBSTA considered the sub-item on the organization of the work of the session.	0
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules, which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do, or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich. 	1
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?" 	1
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited." 	1
OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin. 	1
The Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) made a statement, and also responded to questions.	0
And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct, and then I talk about Spinoza. 	1
And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct. 	1
"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived. 	1
The SBSTA noted that funds to meet these needs are inadequate and, therefore, urged Parties to provide additional resources for this purpose through existing funding mechanisms;	0
Noted that its Chairman stated, without objection, that the Joint Working Group (JWG) of officers of the IPCC and the Convention is a body intended only to facilitate technical coordination between the IPCC and the SBSTA and it is not a decision making body.	0
"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man, but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February." 	1
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories, you know, are real sentences? 	1
Expand the technology needs survey instrument, for example, by adapting a design to incorporate more information on specific technology needs, and to expand the survey to all non-Annex II Parties with a view to having a more comprehensive report for the seventh session of the SBSTA;	0
The problem is, we don't know the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins. 	1
Recalled that the submission deadline for reports to be considered in the synthesis report for the third session of the COP is 30 June 1997;	0
And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity, if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good, then that will truly be magic. Thank you very much. 	1
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity. 	1
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness, which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology, and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens. 	1
What you get is a highly selective loss of one function, with other functions being preserved intact, and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function. 	1
And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces. 	1
And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops, and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother. 	1
There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision, and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces. 	1
d) Methodological work will be required to determine for each type of activity what the minimum data requirements are.	0
(b) In the case of separate reporting, the reports are submitted separately by the designated national authority of each and every participating Party. Information will only be compiled once reports have been received from all participating Parties.	0
Whenever possible, quantitative information should be provided.	0
And in fact, one student asked me the other day, "Do they get phantom PMS?" 	1
If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved." 	1
The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link, that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm. 	1
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality. 	1
Maybe, after a period of practice, you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis, and start moving your paralyzed arm, and then, relieve yourself of pain." 	1
So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me, and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this." 	1
(b) Election of officers other than the Chairman	0
The provisional agenda has been drawn up taking account of the expected timely availability of documentation in the six languages of the United Nations.	0
A suggested approach to the organization of work is contained in annex II below.	0
In addition to presenting its advice on the division of labour at its sixth session, the SBSTA will need to prepare at its seventh session its recommendations to COP 3 on other matters before it, so that the COP can take adequate decisions.	0
Synesthesia runs in families, so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis. 	1
OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it? 	1
So, we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus. 	1
And that is, there is an abnormal gene, a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring. 	1
The secretariat will make an oral report on the progress achieved in the process of reviewing first communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention and on the status of submission of their second communications.	0
At its fifth session, the SBSTA took note of activities undertaken by the secretariat to prepare reports on topics, such as adaptation technologies, the terms of transfer of technology and know-how and technology information centers.	0
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Buba. 	1
At its fifth session, the SBSTA requested the secretariat to develop, in accordance with decision 5/CP.1, practical options with regard to the list of methodological issues contained in paragraph 47 (d) of its report on the work of that session (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/4) and to report on the progress made in this respect.	0

FCCC/SBI/1997/9 Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention: Secretariat activities to facilitate the provision of financial and technical support.	0
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business. 	1
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors? 	1
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar. 	1
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality. 	1
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals, and situations where there are deficits, for example. 	1
D. Preparation by the SBSTA for the third session of the	0
That in turn, because of the weak marketing system, led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country. 	1
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands. 	1
VIII. ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY UNDER THE PILOT PHASE 64 - 66 14	0
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done. 	1
From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market, which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain. 	1
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town. 	1
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade. 	1
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself. 	1
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions, but also planting decisions, on the basis of information coming from the futures price market. 	1
III. DIVISION OF LABOUR BETWEEN THE SBSTA AND THE SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (SBI)	0
This group was invited to prepare draft conclusions on the division of labour for adoption by the SBSTA and the SBI, including a recommendation for a draft decision for adoption by the COP at its third session.	0
It also noted that such information could contribute to the work of other international organizations, the SBSTA, and other bodies of the Convention;	0
We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read-write culture. 	1
(d) Invited the above international organizations to continue to provide information on their work to the SBSTA.	0
(b) Decided that priority should also be given to methods for evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness and effects of specific policies and measures and for assessing adaptation strategies and technologies.	0
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent, until the broadcasters finally got together and said, okay, enough of this. 	1
At the next session, the SBSTA will begin consideration of appropriate ways to provide terms of reference of expert contributions and the review of technical documents to be produced, in accordance with the work programme on methodologies.	0
The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music was no longer available, because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by BMI. 	1
Statement were made by representatives of 11 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States and another speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.	0
At its 3rd meeting, on 30 July, the SBSTA considered the item on co-operation with relevant international organizations.	0
The Chairman and the Chairman-elect of the IPCC made statements and also responded to questions.	0
It's how they understand access to this culture. 	1
B. Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention	0
You're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers. 	1
The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other, a fact we should have learned many, many times over, and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. 	1
So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution. 	1
It's the point about how this connects to our kids. 	1

III. ANNOTATIONS TO THE PROVISIONAL AGENDA	0
♫ A dream within a dream, ♫ ♫ a world within a world, ♫ ♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫ ♫ travels out across the land. ♫ ♫ Images flickering, ♫ ♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫ ♫ a procession of limousines ♫ ♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫ ♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫ ♫ Reaching out from within ♫ ♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ 	1
Finally, in about the sixteenth century, a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim, called Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here --  -- good, old Paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion. 	1
The WMO will provide this report (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/MISC.6).	0
So, they went to the police and they said, "We know that at the Rome railroad station, there are all these lost souls wandering around, muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?" 	1
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression. 	1
And then in the 1950s, late 1950s, the so-called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists, and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion, an electroencephalographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves -- without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes. 	1
It will also have available a technical paper (TP/1997/3) which will provide an overview of adaptation technologies and a note (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/INF.4) on options for technology information centres and information.	0
I'm telling you this story, because actually ever since Richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his speakers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience, that we had never talked about, never written about, I've been planning this moment. 	1
The SBSTA may wish to adopt decisions or texts of substantive conclusions, and authorize the Rapporteur to complete the report after the session with the guidance of the Chairman and the assistance of the secretariat.	0
Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things. 	1
Facilities for informal meetings of the SBSTA will be available in the morning on Tuesday 21 October and in the afternoon on Wednesday 22 October.	0
Monitoring of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere	0
But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself when I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively. 	1
Bearing in mind heightened public awareness and concerns for climate and environmental issues in general, activities associated with the further development and implementation of GAW continue to be prominent.	0
In recent years, new stations have been added to the network and existing ones upgraded.	0
It's known by some people in New Haven, obviously, but it is not generally known. 	1
So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly, selfishly -- unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books. 	1
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is and what our team's job is. 	1
These two projects have successfully demonstrated that some of the gaps in greenhouse gas measurements can be filled.	0
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses. 	1
This has been the key to the analysis under the activities of IPCC.	0
Particularly, the WMO’s GAW programme is considered the atmospheric chemistry contribution to the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS).	0
Figure 7 shows a conceptional design of an operational framework of observations, analysis prediction and research underpinning climate services to society.	0
You'd probably kick me out, or something. 	1
For example, to date five specialized conferences discussing methods of CO2 observations and analysis have been sponsored by WMO (Bern 1981, Interlaken 1985, Hinterzarten 1989, Carqueiranne 1993 and Cairns 1997).	0
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones. 	1
Money is useful for buying food, sustenance, among all its other uses. 	1
For example, under this system the World Calibration Centre for Carbon Dioxide Measurements is at the NOAA laboratory in Boulder, USA.	0
GEF should consider this as a number one priority.	0
Aircraft measurements play an important part in this where new automated techniques are now just being developed.	0
Figure 7. Operational framework of observations, analysis and research	0
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right. 	1
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can't read and write, if you want to communicate over distances, you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with. 	1
The experts were nominated by governments.	0
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people, the stuff that they can't do themselves. 	1
I'm sending money back, and it works like this. 	1
Making recommendations to the COP, in co-operation with the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), for further guidelines regarding the reporting and use of adjusted emission data; and/or	0
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone. 	1
Separating the short-term fluctuations from the general trend has a number of potential applications.	0
It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure. 	1
Furthermore, an undisturbed view of the general trend would be of relevance in view of the commitment in Article 4.2(a) of developed countries, to take the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions.	0
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier. 	1
But what I like about this is, it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface, a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge. 	1
The emissions inventory of the second national communication from the Netherlands contains a separate column with the temperature-adjusted data.	0
Annex II and III summarize some results. Explanatory notes	0
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world. 	1
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate. 	1
Some Parties, while using the above method for the winter period, employ a slightly different method, incorporating a threshold temperature, to calculate the HDD index for the spring and autumn.	0
 "We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion. 	1
In some cases an elasticity of 0.5 to 0.7 is assumed, that is a 1% increase of the HDD index results in a 0.5% to 0.7% increase in emissions.	0
 Which means that somehow, consciously or not, directly or indirectly, in the short or the long term, whatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream -- somehow, is related to a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness. 	1
A simple example for such a relation with the gross domestic product (GDP) as an additional parameter would be the following:	0
Cnorm: corrected fuel consumption of the considered year	0
But if you look at the characteristics of those two, pleasure is contingent upon time, upon its object, upon the place. 	1
It requires considerable amount of historical data and more complex analysis.	0

The matter will be brought to the attention of the Conference at its seventh session for consideration.	0
To have everything. If we miss something, it collapses. 	1
We have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being, what the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing. 	1
And so, if we look from our own experience, anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance, obsessive desire, strong grasping, they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it. 	1
So we may consider that the more those are invading our mind, and, like a chain reaction, the more we feel miserable, we feel tormented. 	1
You cannot, in the same gesture, shake hand and give a blow. 	1
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process. 	1
It looks very menacing, like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm. 	1
It means familiarization with a new way of being, new way of perceiving things, which is more in adequation with reality, with interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation, which our being and our consciousness is. 	1

VII. INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENCE AND HIGH	0
Introduction 1. The report of the Industrial Development Board on its resumed eighteenth session is presented to the General Conference in accordance with Article 9.4 (c) of the Constitution.	0
The scientific embargo -- if it's ever submitted to "Nature," hopefully, it will be accepted. 	1
We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading. 	1
Here is the preliminary result, which I can show because it's already been shown. 	1
The bell curve shows 150 controls, and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe. 	1
But they found that -- this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI, it's like coming out of a space ship. 	1
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful. 	1
That's what we try to do in different places. 	1
13. The following intergovernmental organizations were represented: European Commission, League of Arab States and Organisation of the Islamic Conference.	0
17. The Board had before it a note by the Secretariat on the scale of assessments for the fiscal period 1998-1999 (IDB.18/13) and Programme and Budget Committee conclusion 97/5 on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the regular budget expenses.	0
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models. 	1
25. The Board decided to discuss item 4 (i) separately.	0
But, of course, the natural world, polar bears. 	1
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates -- into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet. 	1
Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work. 	1

But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated. 	1
But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes -- much longer than before -- because they're levitated. 	1
* Alternative A will be included in the contract if the elected Director-General has been a participant in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.	0
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage. 	1
Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here, or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot -- but suppose they arrive and they give you a box. 	1
And different people will have different places they want it set. 	1
(i) Payments of contributions by Member States under the provisions of financial regulation 5.5(e) amounting to $129,540,700 ($23,355,500 plus the equivalent in United States dollars of AS 1,369,789,086) in accordance with decisions to be adopted by the General Conference at its seventh session concerning the scale of assessments;	0
(ii) Miscellaneous and other income of $16,357,900;	0
(d) Further recommended to the General Conference the approval of estimates of net expenditure totalling $27,490,200 at an exchange rate of US$ 1 = AS 12.90 for the purpose of the operational budget for the biennium 1998-1999 to be financed from voluntary contributions and such other income as might be provided for in the financial regulations;	0
Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this. 	1
(c) Recommended the approval of the implementation of the staff separation programme resulting from the 1998-1999 programme and budgets, in accordance with the policy and guiding principles described in paragraphs 5 to 11 of document PBC.13/16;	0
So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes, but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations. 	1
This is what economists call a moral hazard. 	1
Half of the estimated miscellaneous income to the regular budget for the fiscal period, for which credits have not previously been taken into account, and adjustments in estimated miscellaneous income previously taken into account;	0
10.2 (a) The Director-General shall establish such accounts and maintain such accounting records as are necessary, giving due consideration to the United Nations accounting standards.	0
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does, if you understand biology. 	1
Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas, well, you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal. 	1
This is a well-known phenomenon.  You eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true, then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you 	1
What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading? This is one of the gentle giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes. 	1
(a) Took note of the information provided in documents IDB.18/16, IDB.18/16/Add.1, and IDB.18/16/Add.2;	0
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14 bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the 	1

The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business, and then you can bring the oil price back up. 	1
“2. There should be two regular IDB sessions in non-General Conference years: one for a duration of three (3) working days to be held in May-June and one for a duration of two (2) working days later in the year to consider the recommendations of the Programme and Budget Committee.	0
“4. At each regular session the Board shall adopt the provisional agenda for the following regular session, in accordance with rules 10 and 11 of its Rules of Procedure.	0
Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein, "You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity. 	1
Why should it work, and is this something to do with human beings? 	1
And someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law." 	1
I think that's the main point to be made. 	1
Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there. 	1
And he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws." 	1
The basic law, let's say -- here's an assumption. 	1
The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles. 	1
Now, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties. 	1
And so what happens is that the new phenomena, the new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones. 	1
You take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere, and all those rotations leave the sphere alone. 	1
The practice of borrowing by United Nations specialized agencies.	0
The last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields. 	1
Now, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of. 	1
They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics -- didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics. 	1
So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities. 	1
As a basis for the consideration of a number of items, the Committee would have before it the recommendations of the informal meeting established by the Industrial Development Board for the preparation of the current General Conference session.	0
" ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book." 	1
Now, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind? 	1

RHex's foot started off to be quite simple, then it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle. 	1
Extraordinary. No sensing, all the control is built right into the tuned legs. 	1
“Express their concern at the sharp reduction of 20.001 per cent in the 1998-1999 programme and budgets, and call for regarding this as the last reduction in the UNIDO budget and for reversing this trend;	0
“Express their profound concern about the growing inequalities within the international economic system, the growing gap between least developed countries and other economies, and the increased risk of further marginalization of least developed countries in the process of globalization and liberalization;	0
“Recognize the significant role played by the informal sector and by micro-enterprises in the industrial development of least developed countries and request UNIDO to promote the development of these enterprises and to assist them in securing partnership with foreign businesses and enterprises;	0

RF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did. 	1
And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh, because they don't have spines. 	1
So why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn. 	1
It couldn't do that before; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over. 	1
It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look -- and doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface. 	1
Mr. BOURITA (Morocco) could not understand the concerns of the delegation of Japan.	0
Can you use this to make a better robot? 	1
So here's RHex with paddles, now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot. 	1
Mr. BUCH (Germany) said his delegation could not subscribe to the request for restoration of activities that had been discontinued, and to the sharp criticism of UNIDO contained in the conclusions and recommendations of the Fourth LDC Ministerial Symposium.	0
And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit. 	1
There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface. 	1
Mr. POSTA (Hungary) said that, since the Business Plan had been adopted as the guideline for the future, clarity would be improved by incorporating the phrase “within the context of the Business Plan” in the chapeau part of operative paragraph 3.	0

“The General Conference: “(a) Takes note of document GC.7/20;	0
“(b) Notes that, despite considerable efforts made by the Secretariat, the collection rate of assessed contributions was continuing to deteriorate, with the total amount of arrears as of 30 November 1997 at the equivalent of $104.9 million;	0
“(c) Urges those Member States that have not yet paid their assessed contributions to the regular budget, including advances to the Working Capital Fund, from the 1986-1987 to 1996-1997 bienniums, to take the necessary steps to ensure that their contributions are paid promptly and in full;	0
The question of arrears in contributions was one of the most serious problems currently facing UNIDO.	0
All Member States must pay their contributions if UNIDO were to be saved.	0
Mr. NUR (Sudan) agreed with the previous speaker.	0
Mr. SALAZAR (Venezuela) said that his delegation felt that paragraph (e) should be worded in more general terms.	0
To meet the concerns expressed by various delegations, it could possibly be reworded along the lines proposed by Mexico; alternatively, it could refer specifically to measures to be adopted by the Board.	0
He's built, in fact, a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature. 	1
Mr. SOULEYMANE (Niger) supported the proposal to replace “measures” by “recommendations” in paragraph (e).	0
And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design. 	1
Paragraph (f) was therefore superfluous.	0
And so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sped up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor? OK? 	1
However, in a spirit of cooperation, it would be willing to accept the proposal made by the Russian Federation.	0
Steps must be taken before the 1999 General Conference session to expedite the settlement of arrears.	0
With regard to paragraph (e), he proposed that the word “measures” be replaced by “recommendations”.	0

3.4(a) The regular budget shall be divided into major programmes, programmes and subprogrammes for expenditure as well as into sections for income. It shall also be presented by major objects of expenditure. It shall be accompanied by such information annexes and explanatory statements as may be requested by the General Conference (hereinafter referred to as the “Conference”), the Board or the Programme and Budget Committee as well as such annexes as the Director-General may deem necessary or useful.	0

And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization, and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story, a new poetry, a new romanticism. 	1
That's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush. 	1
And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line, and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process. 	1
And so he came up with this beautiful curve. 	1
If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet -- go ahead and do that now -- -- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle, and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right? 	1
Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape. 	1
So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on. 	1
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite. 	1
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling; it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal. 	1
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields." 	1
(iii) Also urged Member States to provide additional cash resources for the staff separation reserve: (a) by voluntary contributions on the understanding that contributions for 1998 for the budget and staff separation reserve would not exceed 1997 assessed contribution levels; (b) by way of advances to the Organization, on the understanding that those advances would be repaid as and when the arrears of assessed contributions are paid, or deducted from future contributions;	0
The General Conference adopted the recommen-dation contained in decision IDB.18/Dec.1 of the Industrial Development Board and decided to appoint by acclamation Carlos Alfredo Magariños as Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization for a period of four years from 8 December 1997 or until the Director-General appointed at the ninth regular session of the General Conference assumes office, whichever is later.	0
The Director-General, upon recommendation of the Board, has been duly appointed by the Conference at the 8th plenary meeting of its seventh session held on 5 December 1997 (GC.7/Dec.18).	0

The official duty station for the Director-General shall be Vienna, Austria.	0

So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry. 	1
In Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand, and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph; we now call it an Eulerian path -- you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice. 	1
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game. 	1
But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences. 	1

So, let's see, let's take a different row of people, starting with you. 	1
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts. 	1
I know it sounds complicated; it's not. 	1
I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of "Rain Man." 	1
If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, "you're close," or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself. 	1
 There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes, and we don't other times. 	1
That is to say, if we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them. 	1
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption, to noticing, to empathy and to compassion. 	1
But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to. 	1

I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse. 	1
Under component A, the resources at the end of 1998-1999 biennium are expected to amount to $32,134,735, made up of $2,274,735 in fund balance as at 1 January 1998 to which would be added general fund contributions of $9.5 million and earmarked contributions of $20 million making it $29,500,000 from expected contributions and pledges, $60,000 from other sources of income and $300,000 in expected savings from prior years' unliquidated obligations.	0

Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves and get to work, passionately, in creating an almost perfect world. 	1

There's a good reason why: the shallow water's full of predators -- here's a barracuda -- and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod, you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide. 	1
The budgeted amount will be allocated evenly to each of the four subprogrammes.	0
This reduction reflects the general tendency of cutting travel expenses.	0

And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good -- they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails. 	1
So, think of your own, send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome. 	1
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA. 	1
It also includes charges for shipping UNCHS (Habitat) publications to various National Habitat II Committees, Habitat Focal Points, academic and scientific institutions, non-governmental organizations, community-based groups and other partners.	0
They think of somebody choosing fabrics. 	1
And then they make a little tent for the baby. 	1
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929, which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better. 	1
Implementation of these activities is subject to the availability of resources after taking into account the requirements for the programme, for programme support and for the statutory reserve.	0
So you see, the range is really quite diverse. 	1
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together." 	1
So, designers do need to be mavericks, because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it. 	1
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police. 	1
A review of table 2 indicates that the proportional share of various activities in the expected resources in the coming biennium compared with the current biennium will be as follows: Categories	0
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell, and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks. 	1
In moments of war there's great technological innovation, and in the world you have to do without -- well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel, you had to do without aluminum. 	1
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur, which is quite fantastic. 	1
This factor is relevant for considering the report and recommendations of ACABQ since most of its recommendations regarding a reduction in expenditure concern the general funds of the Foundation.	0
3. The recommendations of the ACABQ on the proposed budget of the Foundation for the biennium 1998-1999 (HS/C/16/12) are constructive and the secretariat plans to implement them all, some immediately and some within a longer time-frame, possibly the whole of 1998-1999 biennium.	0
As an immediate measure the levels of income and expenditure in the proposed budget have been revised downwards as recommended by ACABQ and are presented in tables 2A, 3A, 5A and 6A on pages , , and of the current report.	0
But there it is: "Jó napot, pacák" I said somebody here must surely know, because despite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with, and the further fact that, so far as I know, there's not a drop of Hungarian blood in my veins, at every critical juncture of my life there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me. 	1
And as a consequence of that presumption, my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army, an experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history. 	1

making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina, a Methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College. 	1
I knew nothing about Wofford and even less about Methodism, but I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College to find, among the auditors in my classroom, a 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged European women who seemed to function as an entourage of Rhinemaidens. 	1
He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away. 	1
He was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew -- his parents weren't very religious anyhow -- but because he had been born with two club feet, a condition which, in those days, required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11. 	1
17. The revised estimates of income and expenditure are shown in table 2A, below which replaces table 2 of the original budget.	0
Tables 5B and 6B, on pages and below, respectively, show a comparison of the different proposed budgets for programme and programme-support costs, respectively.	0
In those early days of the Final Solution, it was handcrafted brutality; people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river. 	1
The reason for this situation is the lack of adequate provision in the regular budget and the need to limit the size of the staffing table of the Foundation due to the voluntary nature of the source of funding of the Foundation.	0
Which, as chance would have it, was Spartanburg, South Carolina, the location of Wofford College. 	1
The budgets for all these items have been reduced in the revised tables for programme and programme-support costs, as shown in tables 5A and 6A in the current report.	0
In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having retired from the textile industry, adopted Wofford College, auditing courses every semester, and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved, becoming affectionately known as "Opi" -- which is Magyar for grandfather -- by all and sundry. Before I got there, the library of the college had been named for Mr. Teszler, and after I arrived in 1993, the faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College -- 	1
And it was at his house that I heard for the first time Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina He was dying of leukemia and he knew it, and he dedicated this concerto to his wife, Dita, who was herself a concert pianist. 	1
To which I need only add, "Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves." 	1
 And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech, but I have a box of slides. 	1
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport. 	1
As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard. 	1
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there. 	1
Consequently, the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda (paras. 11, 24, 26, 39, 40 and 61) reflect a consensus on the commitment to the progressive realization of the right to adequate housing.	0

In response to resolution 15/5 and following the recommendations of the annual Meetings of Ministers Responsible for Human Settlements in European Transition Countries, UNCHS (Habitat) has continued to support training of elected local government officials and management staff within the framework of its Local Leadership Training Programme and Settlements Management Training Programme.	0
And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator -- who was tragically killed in a plane accident -- he had heard about my desire to build a new building, because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. 	1
He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company." 	1
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food. 	1
The Municipality of Rio de Janeiro supported by the Government of Brazil, according to the terms of the agreement, takes charge of all transfer and installation costs, office premises and equipment, as well as of General Service staff and communication costs.	0
That was done by a student after seven months in the program, done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef. 	1
In January 1996, the two organizations signed an agreement, initially for one year, to double the SCP core support capacity and share the cost in equal contributions.	0
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry, we train medical technicians for the medical industry, and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon. 	1
And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read. 	1

We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging. 	1
While core funding is provided by the Government of Belgium, a wide range of international, national and local partners are also involved in the programme.	0

And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later, but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing. 	1
And I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission, I have now accumulated 600 recordings of the greatest artists in the world, including Joe Williams, who died, but not before his last recording was done at my school. 	1

I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image, so I got a look-alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination. 	1
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby? 	1
In the Conference, it organized the dialogue on health in cities of tomorrow and a workshop on environment, habitat and health.	0
In implementing the Habitat Agenda, the Bank's efforts will focus on supporting the provision of basic urban services, urban environmental improvement, strengthening urban finance and reducing urban poverty in developing countries.	0
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) participated in the Conference and its preparatory process with a series of substantive inputs.	0
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work, films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work, politicians were getting involved -- all sorts of things -- great headlines. 	1
The Centre and ECLAC are in the process of formulating a strategy for the implementation of this Regional Plan of Action.	0
And what is going to happen to the monarchy? 	1
And with some look-alikes, they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not. 	1
The Centre is also involved in the current United Nations New System-wide Initiative on Africa and has prepared a special programme to assist African countries in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda.	0
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same. 	1
The Urban Management Programme (UMP) supported several city consultations, demonstrations, seminars and workshops at the city, national, regional and interregional levels on land management, poverty alleviation and urban environmental management.	0
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way; I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. 	1
In September 1995, UNCHS (Habitat) sponsored a ministerial meeting in Barbados which, inter alia, examined the complexities of human settlement issues in small island States.	0
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change, and there were a terrible thing that has happened, but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that. 	1
By its resolutions 32/162 of 19 December 1977 and 34/114 of 14 December 1979, the General Assembly recommended that cooperation should be sought, at the global and regional levels, with non-governmental organizations and requested the Executive Director to undertake the preparation of a biennial report in 1982 on activities and collaboration between the Centre and non-governmental organizations.	0
In line with this protocol, they formed a global network called G4+ and organized the World Assembly of Cities and Local Authorities, a parallel event to the Habitat II Conference.	0
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise. 	1
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER." 	1
The Global Parliamentarians on Habitat participated in the preparatory process of Habitat II and emphasized the public policy and legislative aspects of human settlements development.	0
And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to. 	1
The Rockefeller Foundation also supported the Conference's preparatory process, through a grant made to UNFPA.	0
And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting. 	1
During the Habitat II process, six regional youth networks were established to participate in the formulation of the Global Plan of Action.	0
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me, "Chris, TED is a really great conference. 	1
 So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason, and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. 	1
Urban development programmes and housing finance activities in Chile and other countries of the region have been implemented in close collaboration with a network of research, non-governmental organizations and private sector organizations such as the Unión Interamericana para la Vivienda (UNIAPRAVI).	0
1. Partners' activities in collaboration with the centre	0
In order to strengthen and expand collaboration in the Conference's follow-up activities, 10 partner working groups have been established within the Centre to collaborate with each group of the Habitat II partners on their priorities and programmes for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda in the context of the UNCHS (Habitat) programme of work.	0
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices. 	1
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car, go get it, drive it. 	1
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters. 	1
Page I. BACKGROUND The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) (Habitat) has been entrusted by the international community with the role of monitoring, coordinating and providing technical assistance to countries in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda.	0
The evaluation process is being implemented through a collaborative effort involving all offices, divisions and units of the Centre under the leadership of the Executive Director.	0
And the social benefits: the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent; I think we can get that down to 50 percent. 	1
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London. 	1
Expansion of evaluation activities will be encouraged, particularly strategic, thematic and independent evaluation of selected programmes.	0
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story, which is: when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming. 	1
For this purpose, modern information systems will be utilized as a means of ensuring a continuous consultative process on the issue.	0
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment? 	1
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy and I'm going to be the wise businessman. 	1
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals. 	1
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman. 	1
So you know, when you stick this idea ...  where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across America. 	1
What's the wireless technology we're going to use? 	1
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts. 	1
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city. 	1
As is evident from the above quotation, from paragraph 213 of the Habitat Agenda, and clearly reaffirmed elsewhere in the document, in paragraphs 20, 35, 37 and 213, national and local levels of government have the primary responsibility for its implementation.	0
The principle mechanisms for implementation of the Habitat Agenda are national and local five-year plans of action, partners̓ five-year plans of action and the support programmes of multilateral and bilateral cooperation agencies.	0
Oaxaca, San Francisco -- it's very easy: Market Street, Van Ness and the waterfront. 	1
So, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day, now it's 2,200,000 passengers a day. 	1
And that's the evolution of the system. 	1
What in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes: the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway. 	1
We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus. 	1
And you can understand how different it's going to be, the image of Rio with the system -- one-minute frequency. 	1
And now we have 70 percent -- since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world. 	1
Partners (including non-governmental organizations and the private sector) also may wish to formulate their own five-year plans of action to implement the Habitat Agenda.	0
You should have always a structure of living and working together. 	1
And every part can be transformed; every frog can be transformed in a prince. 	1
The overall web site will have three major areas: first, an area that is controlled by UNCHS (Habitat) that includes web pages on each of the main programme areas and activities of UNCHS (Habitat) relating to follow-up and implementation of the Habitat Agenda; second, a set of sites that are managed by representatives of Habitat II partners - either on behalf of a partner group or on behalf of an individual partner; and third, a set of interactive sites or processes for interaction with partners - where these areas may be facilitated by UNCHS (Habitat) or by a partner in cooperation with UNCHS (Habitat), subject to guidelines agreed upon.	0
I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals, and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found. 	1
Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use, I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener. 	1
I was here, planting my chunks, cutting up potatoes and planting it, and the bees were working on this tree; bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate. 	1
I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat. 	1
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development, rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment, particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment.	0
Ugh. Mini-Me.  We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin, we figured out we are just one species among many; evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others; we are acted upon as well as acting; we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life. 	1
As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view, you realize that the real literary conceit is that -- is the idea that nature is opposed to culture, the idea that consciousness is everything -- and that's another very important thing it does. 	1
But, you know, there's a comedian who said, "Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important? 	1
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. 	1
Based on the findings of this study, a training manual for local authorities on how to deal with street children and shelter issues is being prepared.	0
And that is this: the farm is called Polyface, which means ... 	1
But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now. 	1
There is therefore a strong case for promoting an integrated approach, based on actions that are:	0
For the purpose of this report, integrated programmes could be divided into two main types, those of a broad developmental nature (i.e. not necessarily child-centred, but beneficial to children), and those which are child-centred.	0
An integrated (holistic) action can start with the definition of a focal issue, around which a whole implementation strategy should be built.	0
Integrated programmes have the potential to address at the same time the conditions of survival, functioning and development of children, and provide long-term sustainability prospects.	0
2. Supporting and refocusing sectoral policies and programmes related to human settlements	0
Human-settlements-related policies and programmes may have a general scope, and, although not having a specific focus on children, they often benefit them in one or more ways.	0
This strategy focuses on the support of programmes which are specifically directed to children, therefore benefiting them in one or more aspects (i.e. survival, functioning, development).	0
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture. 	1
The latter includes: (i) general actions related to shelter, services and settlement-wide issues; (ii) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances (including those in critical housing conditions, the homeless, female headed households and evicted families); and (iii) specific actions for children (mainly children in especially difficult circumstances).	0
Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it. 	1
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning; maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome. 	1
But even though I just started this presentation, this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate. 	1
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on, so I decided to move towards packaging.  I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things. 	1
6. Video films on child-friendly cities: case-studies of Nairobi and Accra (to be issued in February 1997).	0
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole, getting a different kind of perspective, moving you around the space.

He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him. 	1
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring, and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building, apartment by apartment, checking every television, checking every connection, hoping to find out what this problem is. 	1

Finally, it will have to decide upon the date and venue of the second session of the Conference of the Parties, taking account of:	0
Consistent with FAO working hours and to avoid incurring overtime expenses, the normal working hours of COP 1 will be from 9.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon, and from 2.00 p.m. to 5 p.m. No provision has been made for more than two meetings to be held with services at any one time.	0
Rule 19 of the draft rules of procedure provides: "The credentials of representatives as well as the names of alternate representatives and advisers shall be submitted to the Permanent Secretariat if possible not later than twenty-four hours after the opening of the session.	0
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city. 	1
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here. 	1
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way. 	1
The COP will have before it for consideration a draft decision prepared by the Secretariat on programme and budget, contained in document ICCD/COP(1)/2, which includes a section on interim arrangements.	0

A/AC.241/31 Review of the situation as regards extrabudgetary funds	0
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later.  The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war: two players who couldn't trust each other. 	1
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed. 	1
First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10, whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over -- or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over. 	1
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99. 	1

And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. 	1
Women in Uganda this year, who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day, actually evoked the wrath of the government. 	1
 She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. 	1
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers. 	1
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut. 	1
7. Statement by Secretary—General of the World Meteorological Organization	0
1. Statement by H.E. the Vice—President of Colombia on behalf of the Non—Aligned Movement	0
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going, or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. 	1
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future, or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women, it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself. 	1
And with this hand I'm controlling the volume, so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets. 	1
 Maybe we'll go into the next tune, because I totally lost where this is going. 	1
We're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone," and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax. 	1
  So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked; there are so many. 	1
Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization; that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building. 	1
PART TWO: ACTION TAKEN BY THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES	0
 In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which you see here the campus. 	1
He highlighted the importance of the Committee on Science and Technology (CST) in implementing the CCD.	0
At its 1st plenary meeting on 30 September, a message from the Secretary—General of the United Nations was conveyed to the Conference by Mr. Nitin Desai, Under—Secretary—General for the Department of Economic and Social Affairs; and opening statements were made by Ambassador Bo Kjellén, Chairman of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the Elaboration of an International Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa (INCD); Mr. Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); Professor G.O.P. Obasi, Secretary—General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO); Mr. Fawzi H. Al-Sultan, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Mr. Anders Wijkman, Assistant Administrator, speaking on behalf of the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Mr. Franklin Cardy, Executive Coordinator Natural Resources, speaking on behalf of the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); and Mr. Hama Arba Diallo, Executive Secretary of the interim secretariat of the CCD.	0
And then I went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking. 	1
(e) Organization to house Global Mechanism and agreement on its modalities	0
It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington, the U.S. Institute of Peace. 	1
(l) Creation of ad hoc panel(s) of experts, if necessary, with their terms of reference	0
And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera -- that it had to do with whiteness, it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism. 	1
And here studying, in three dimensions, how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure; not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process. 	1
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed. 	1
Establishment of the Committee of the Whole	0
The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy. 	1
Then one day, an elder gave me a story that went like this: long time ago, there was a big war between tribes. 	1
On 2 October, the Committee adopted its agenda and elected Mr. Sun Hongli (China), Mr. Salah Tahoun (Egypt) and Ms. Linda Brown (United Kingdom) as vice-chairpersons of the Committee of Science and Technology.	0
At the same meeting, the Executive Secretary of the interim secretariat made a statement.	0
And that man told me, "So, here you are. 	1
And I came for them, and that's my goal. 	1
I'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues because people from outside can come and help us, but if we don't help ourselves, there's nothing to do. 	1
The session was also attended by observers from the following 34 States and one regional economic integration organization not parties to the Convention:	0
They were actually going to go -- Ted Taylor, who led the project, was going to take his children. 	1
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture. 	1
This is what happened at 600 microseconds. 	1
The size of that mass, for us, is really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to. 	1
And one part of NASA was interested in it, but the headquarters in NASA, they killed the project. 	1
So that's the state we're at; it's not very good. 	1
And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED. 	1
I understand those statements as an indication of the firm resolve of those countries to become soon Parties to the Convention by completing the process of the needed accession.	0
And the basic idea is that there's this law of attraction, and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you. 	1
At its 1st plenary meeting on 30 September 1997, a message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations was conveyed to the Conference by Mr. Nitin Desai, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.	0
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is. 	1
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. 	1
UNEP would continue to support implementation efforts at regional and global level, work to achieve improved assessment and science, support the CST, develop projects for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and work to raise awareness of desertification issue worldwide.	0
The availability of adequate financing, combined with total commitment, at the political level and at all levels of government and society were essential to combat desertification.	0
COP1 was a determining moment for the future of the Convention.	0
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard. 	1
At its 5th plenary meeting on 3 October, Mr. Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) made a statement.	0

Deputy Permanent Representative of Panama to the United Nations Office at Geneva	0
It's called the WorldWide Telescope, and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. 	1
In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe. 	1
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy, in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe, where time itself seems to stand still. 	1
Minister of Environment and Land Management	0
And the tours are all totally interactive, so that if I were to go somewhere ... 	1
So basically, kids of all ages, like us. 	1
List of documents before the first session of the Conference of the Parties	0
I'm going to talk about a hobby that can scale and show you photos I've taken over the years with kids like these, that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become a Richard Branson or Diamandis. 	1

I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then, if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion. 	1
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of. 	1
(g) "Permanent Secretariat" means the Permanent Secretariat designated by the Conference of the Parties in accordance with article 23, paragraph 3 of the Convention;	0
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago, I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply. 	1
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data. 	1
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything, but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology, and that is: why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed? 	1
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second; they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds; they're completely crowded together, they're jammed, they're bashing up against each other. 	1
So a kid who's 14 in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem, which is a truly subtle and interesting proof, but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics. 	1
This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher, but was a natural mathematician. 	1
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this. 	1
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did. 	1
So if you look at the little script here, the speed is always going to be 30. 	1
Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball because they're two totally different weights, and if you drop them at the same time, maybe they'll drop at the same speed. 	1
And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child, only 400 years ago. 	1
They shall serve as the Bureau of the session.	0
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it? 	1
3. The President, in the exercise of the powers of that office, remains under the authority of the Conference of the Parties.	0
Forget about messages; children are the future, and children in the first and second world and, most especially, in the third world need mentors. 	1
And in the lab, we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" 	1
Meetings of any other subsidiary bodies shall be held in conjunction with the sessions of the Conference of the Parties, unless the Conference of the Parties decides otherwise.	0
The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers. 	1
Because they process information differently, each of our hemispheres think about different things, they care about different things, and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. 	1
I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. 	1
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke. 	1
(e) Arrange for the custody and preservation of the documents of the session; and	0
And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience. 	1
I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. 	1
As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting unless copies of it have been circulated to delegations in all the official languages not later than the day preceding the meeting.	0
Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world. 	1
(c) To adjourn the debate on the question under discussion;	0
If all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted and no agreement has been reached, the decision shall, as a last resort, be taken by a two-thirds majority vote of the Parties present and voting, [except for decisions taken under article 21 [and article 22 paragraph 2 (g)] of the Convention which shall be agreed upon by consensus, or] [unless otherwise provided by	0
And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tell. 	1
And in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card... that's not the card. 	1
If this vote is also equally divided, the proposal shall be regarded as withdrawn.	0
So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help. 	1
And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality. 	1
Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. 	1
And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. 	1
3. The vote of each Party participating in a roll-call or recorded vote shall be included in the relevant documents of the session.	0
I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form, Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a solid. 	1
Separate from the flow, separate from you. 	1
Where you are now, all of a sudden, sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems, and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen? 	1
The official languages of the Conference of the Parties shall be Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.	0
I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies. 	1
But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays: we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points -- and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass -- if glass was the substrate, which it usually is. 	1
The Supplementary Fund shall receive contributions pursuant to paragraphs 12 (b) and (c), other than those specified in paragraphs 7 and 10, including contributions earmarked, in accordance with paragraph 15, for:	0
And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium. 	1
Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track, which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert, and say, "Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes." 	1
There are all sorts of techniques you will use -- and again, this is a different kind of branching. 	1
Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see, I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read. 	1
19. Contributions not immediately required shall be invested at the discretion of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in consultation with the head of the Convention Secretariat.	0
I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame, but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that's described in the text. 	1
23. Any amendment to the present rules shall be adopted by the Conference of the Parties by consensus.	0
1. Notes with appreciation the advice of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on this matter, as contained in document A/AC.241/44, as amended in paragraph 4 of document A/AC.241/55, as well as the clarifications in document A/AC.241/64 and related comments made in Working Group I of the Committee;	0
5. Decides to review these arrangements not later than at its fourth session, in consultation with the Secretary-General, with a view to making such modifications as may be considered desirable by both parties;	0
And they all got up and they all went downstairs and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent: they asked the child, "Can you read?" 	1
The child read beautifully, it turned out, and was really very competent. So it actually meant something. 	1
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar, but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there, and it is: when does it mean something to a child? 	1
Executive direction and management 557.6	0
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues, whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be. 	1
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. 	1
8. Recalls that, in accordance with paragraph 14 of the financial rules, contributions for 1999 are expected on or before 1 January 1999 and that each Party should, as far in advance as possible of that date, inform the head of the Permanent Secretariat of the contribution it intends to make and the projected timing of that contribution;	0

(a) support the participation of representatives of non—governmental organizations from affected developing country Parties, particularly the least developed among them, in sessions of the Conference of the Parties;	0
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird, and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space. 	1
And we continue to work with this client. 	1
In the '60s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's. 	1
2. Also decides to review the implementation of the Convention at its second session on the basis of statements and documents presented by delegations at that session;	0
And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement. 	1
And after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins. 	1
2. Decides also to transmit the draft decision contained in document A/AC.241/L.42 to its third session for consideration.	0
10. Reports should be as concise as possible to facilitate their review.	0
For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed. 	1

3. Invites the Council of the GEF to report as appropriate to the Conference of the Parties on matters relating to the issue of land degradation.	0
Decides to adopt the terms of reference attached to the present decision.	0
And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning, asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me. 	1
2. Consistent with the provisions of the Convention, particularly its articles 16 to 18 and 24, and at the request of the Conference of the Parties, the functions of the Committee include the following.	0
And so Stanley did the little dome thing. 	1
(ii) Collect information, analyse, assess and report on the impact of developments in science and technology and give advice on the possible utilization of such developments for the implementation of the Convention.	0

In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment. 	1
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it. 	1
They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is. 	1
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it's that formed lumber from Finland. 	1
Sohio is on the axis here, and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts. 	1
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries. 	1
Having reviewed the proposed roster of independent experts (ICCD/COP(1)/6 and Add.1) prepared by the Permanent Secretariat of the Convention in accordance with decision 10/11 based on submissions from Parties by diplomatic channels,	0
The dome was a request from the client. 	1
(a) making the roster more balanced in terms of gender representation;	0
And you're through this room in a split second, and the building will sort of reflect that. 	1
2. Approves the proposal of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), on behalf of itself and a consortium of members, contained in ICCD/COP(1)/CST/2/Add.1 for the amount proposed, plus 13 per cent programme support costs, and requests the head of the Permanent Secretariat of the Convention to enter into any necessary contractual arrangements on behalf of the Conference of the Parties for completion of the work within the framework of the attached terms of reference;	0

You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built. 	1
Decision 24/COP.1 Organization to house the Global Mechanism	0
On the side facing the street it's much more normal, except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point, these housing units made a gesture to the corner. 	1
We've had a lot of fun working together. 	1
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall, with a rodeo and restaurants. 	1
7. Urges Governments and all interested organizations, including non—governmental organizations and the private sector, to make promptly the voluntary contributions necessary to ensure that the Global Mechanism can begin operating on 1 January 1998 on the basis of Section A of Appendix I of document ICCD/COP(1)/5 and continue effective operations on the basis of the memorandum of understanding referred to in paragraph 3 above after its adoption by the second session of the COP;	0
In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel, we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum. 	1
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here. 	1

Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space. 	1
5. Requests the organization housing the Global Mechanism to report to the second session of the COP on modalities regarding collaboration between itself and the NGO community, as well as collaboration with other interested organizations, including the private sector.	0
- demand–driven but also pro–actively responsive to the needs and priorities of Parties;	0
(b) The Bank would integrate appropriate drylands management policies in its Environmental Sector Work and Country Assistance Strategies and use these in its ongoing dialogue with affected countries to internalize drylands management issues within the countries' economic development programmes, and thus bring them forward for financing in the Bank's active portfolio and other donors' support;	0
And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement. 	1
13. The GM would operate according to the modus operandi and procedures agreed upon in harmony with those of the GM housing institution.	0
14. The Administrator of UNDP and the President of IFAD would meet periodically, to agree on strategies for implementing the CCD and to harmonize their support for the work of the GM.	0
And many experiences like this happened to me. 	1
15. At the request of the GM, the three institutions may establish ad hoc task forces to develop ideas and work on specific issues, particularly innovative resource mobilization approaches, to help the GM entity in its work.	0
Recalling article 22, paragraph 7, of the Convention,	0
Noting also that such rule 7 also provides that such observers may, upon invitation of the President, participate without the right to vote in the proceedings of any session in matters of direct concern to the body or agency they represent, unless at least one third of the Parties present at the session object,	0
And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding. 	1
(b) To accredit to the first and subsequent sessions of the Conference of the Parties those additional non-governmental organizations that the Permanent Secretariat may recommend for accreditation, as listed in annex I to the present decision;	0
(d) To accord observer status at the first session of the Conference of the Parties to all interested intergovernmental organizations previously accorded such status at sessions of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the Elaboration of an International Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, as listed in annex II to the present decision;	0
But then I began to explore another alternative. 	1
But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus. 	1
2. Decides that the second session of the Conference of the Parties shall be held in Dakar from 24 August to 4 September 1998;	0

Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war. 	1
But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills, especially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education. 	1
C. Financial rules of the COP, its subsidiary bodies and the permanent secretariat	0
The ability to make and test models has become essential, not only to every single area of science today, but also to modern society itself. 	1
And to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent. 	1
3. Establishment and maintenance of a roster of independent experts	0
It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word: we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel. 	1
And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community, to be successful -- and they're very ambitious. 	1
So we designed it to have interactive teaching. 	1
DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES	0
They'll do well. They'll have successful careers. 	1
And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places. 	1
 I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture. 	1
She's a physicist, and somehow stays smiling, in spite of everything going on back home. 	1
And she's now at AIMS.  So now let me get to our TED wish. 	1
And our wish has two parts: one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK. 	1
(d) The proposed budget as well as all questions pertaining to the accounts and financial arrangements;	0
Well, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple. 	1
Local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in. 	1
Any later change in the composition of the delegation shall also be submitted to the Permanent Secretariat.	0
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn, I was trying to finish my first book, I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m. 	1

3. Meetings of ad hoc subsidiary bodies shall be private unless the ad hoc subsidiary body concerned decides otherwise.	0
In the case of a subsidiary body that is not open-ended, a majority of the Parties designated by the Conference of the Parties to participate therein shall constitute a quorum.	0
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads. 	1
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months We had tables, chairs, computers, everything. 	1
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane. 	1
(c) Publish and distribute the official documents of the session;	0
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back. 	1
The presence of two thirds of the Parties to the Convention shall be required for any decision to be taken.	0
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention -- they go home, they're finished. They don't stall. 	1
1. No one may speak at a meeting of the Conference of the Parties without having previously obtained the permission of the President.	0

An amendment shall be voted on before the proposal to which it relates is put to the vote, and if the amendment is adopted, the amended proposal shall then be voted on.	0
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web.  Is that a rule? I don't know. 	1
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public. 	1
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, "Well, why don't we have a place like that here?" 	1
After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting.	0

This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories, a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School," which is a great title, I think. 	1

He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule." 	1
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people, endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people, putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others, and this is because of human ego, human greed. 	1
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who, when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong. 	1
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing." 	1

(b) Reports on joint, subregional and regional action programmes	0
(c) Reports of developed country Parties	0
The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried, because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body -- but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality, so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming, as it were, from the United Nations, from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this. 	1
Such rotation shall apply to subsequent sessions.	0

This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control. 	1
Recalling article 24, paragraph 2, of the Convention, which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall establish and maintain a roster of independent experts with expertise and experience in the relevant fields, based on nominations received in writing from the Parties, taking into account the need for a multidisciplinary approach and broad geographical representation,	0
 It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987, when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. 	1

So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track -- many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old, and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno -- and we did this little animation. 	1
(d) To accord observer status at the first session of the Conference of the Parties to all interested intergovernmental organizations previously accorded such status at sessions of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the Elaboration of an International Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, as listed in annex III to the present decision;	0

I. THE TRANSITION FROM THE INTERIM TO THE PERMANENT SECRETARIAT2	0
C. Substantive Support to the COP and its Subsidiary Bodies6	0
A considerable part of the work of the Secretariat, as described in the above paragraph, will be essentially country-driven, as foreseen in the Convention.	0
The difficulty in anticipating two years in advance the demands to be placed upon the Secretariat is likely to become a normal feature of the CCD budgetary process.	0
Activities under (a) above would be funded from the "core" CCD budget; these activities and the related budget would be fairly predictable and require limited flexibility.	0
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories, and most of what we think about are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution, hazardous waste dumps. But there are also regional environmental problems, like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe to the Arctic, and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico. 	1
It is suggested that the above six programmes constitute the "main appropriation lines" in terms of rule 6 of the proposed financial rules, within each of which the head of the Secretariat may make transfers between objects of expenditure.	0
Already, around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA. 	1
It is further assumed that any cost differentials resulting from decisions by the COP on the location of the Secretariat will be considered separately under the relevant sub-item of the agenda of COP 1 and will be incorporated into the budget once a decision is taken on this issue.	0
(Legislative basis: CCD articles 22 and 24)	0
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress, but here is the key: when given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom. 	1
Pursuant to INCD decision 10/11, a draft annotated agenda for the first session of the Committee has been prepared and is contained in document ICCD/COP(1)/CST/1.	0
Furthermore, provision will need to be made for the translation, processing and distribution of an estimated 500 pages of pre-session, in-session and post-session documentation.	0
But geothermal, concentrating solar, advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation. 	1
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia. 	1
The comparable current establishment also includes five posts (D-2, D-1 and three GS); one GS post is funded from the trust fund, and the other four posts by the regular budget of the United Nations.	0
In addition, core budget requirements amounting to USD 199,000 are expected to arise in respect of general temporary assistance (USD 16,000 for 4 work/months of General Service staff) required for peak workload periods and for replacement of staff on sick or maternity leave; overtime for General Service staff arising from the sessions of the COP (USD 3,000); consultancies for expert services (USD 66,000 for 6 work/months including travel); travel of staff for consultative missions with administrative services of the United Nations Headquarters, with government authorities, intergovernmental bodies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on issues related to the Convention and for participation in activities of specialized agencies and UN programmes concerned with issues relating to the CCD (USD 110,000); and for hospitality (USD 4,000) tendered in the official interest of the CCD to members of delegations, Governments or NGOs, and officials of intergovernmental organizations.	0
provide to the Head of the Secretariat such legal advice as may be required.	0
assist the CST in its linkage with the scientific community, and maintain related contacts with relevant governmental and intergovernmental institutions of both national and international scope.	0
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED. 	1
to assist the COP in its review of the implementation of the Convention;	0
In respect of (a) above, and consistent with INCD decision 9/9 (paragraphs 16-19), the Secretariat will, beginning with the third session of the COP, receive and compile the summaries of reports provided by Parties and relevant organizations under the Convention; and will, on that basis, prepare syntheses of the reports, setting out the trends emerging in the implementation of the Convention.	0
And, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money, probably a lot of schools, or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard, normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. 	1
You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack. 	1
 The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. 	1
awareness raising at the decision-making and local levels,	0
And you can see that it looks like a 3D room. 	1
The cost of these activities could be estimated at USD 410,000 including USD 40,000 in consultancies, USD 20,000 for travel of staff, USD 20,000 for external interpretation, USD 50,000 in grants and USD 280,000 for travel of participants.	0
And that's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product. 	1
But actually, to me, what's almost more interesting than either of these two projects is how people actually found out about them. 	1
At the subregional level, it should be recalled that a number of subregional organizations (Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel, Intergovernmental Authority and Development, Southern African Development Community, Union du Maghreb Arabe) have undertaken, in collaboration with the Secretariat, a number of significant activities towards the formulation of subregional action programmes.	0
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself. 	1
Future activities at the subregional level could be expected to include support towards:	0
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow. 	1
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again. 	1
design and implementation of four pilot projects for capacity building, possibly leading to partnership arrangements (USD 470,000, comprising USD 440,000 in grants and USD 30,000 for a consultancy to assist in the evaluation of the exercise);	0
Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm, and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends, who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -- and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it, you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button, 	1
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease. 	1
support to NGOs through a project with objectives similar to those outlined at the subregional level in paragraph 46 (b) above (USD 41,000), including USD 20,000 in grants and USD 21,000 for travel of staff); and	0
At the national level, it is anticipated that support would continue to be provided for:	0
NGO participation in the above, at an estimated cost of USD 55,000 including USD 40,000 for travel of NGO representatives and USD 15,000 for travel of staff; and	0
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. 	1
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. 	1
Thus, in line with paragraph 65 below, an objective would be to raise awareness and generate interest through the sensitization of the public at large.	0
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces, as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. 	1
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child. 	1
As regards interagency coordination, the main task shall be to promote efficient working arrangements with the organizations concerned, including at the country level.	0
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work? 	1
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer. 	1
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making. 	1
coordinate the respective programmes of work within the context of action programmes.	0
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express? 	1

Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right? 	1
Total core requirements for 1999 for this programme are, therefore, estimated at USD 582,700.	0
faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote, "practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.," once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average. 	1
prepare and submit biennial programme and budget proposals for review and approval by the COP;	0
initiate recruitment action of staff, including temporary staff and consultants;	0
So, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based; they could be decentralized, or centralized. 	1
establishing and maintaining an adequate computer facility and telecommunications system designed to support realistically the information technology requirements of the Secretariat, including information on national, subregional and regional action programmes; and	0
The price system was a market-based and decentralized system. 	1
May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share, if they want to, by themselves or with others, because property is one mechanism of coordination. 	1
It is assumed that required hardware and software, and related furniture, would be provided by the Government hosting the permanent Secretariat.	0
pro memoria provision for the following two items:	0
"...The Secretary-General would request the General Assembly to approve the following arrangements regarding reimbursements: the reimbursement made to the United Nations for administering trust funds would be levied on the basis of actual costs incurred.	0
There was massive flooding in Indonesia. 	1
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent, we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else. 	1
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world? 	1
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that. 	1
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do? 	1
It also amended the terms of reference of the Trust Fund to take into consideration the recommendations of the Inter-governmental Negotiating Committee regarding the participation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in its sessions.	0
In addition they summarize the Secretariat's utilization of UN regular budget resources for the same period and the Secretariat's planned activities for the second half of the year 1997.	0
Paragraphs 3 and 4 of that document outline the provisions of General Assembly resolution 51/180 which authorized continued GA funding in 1998, as well as continuation of the Trust Fund and the Special Voluntary Fund.	0
Annex I shows the Secretariat's total regular budget allotments and expenditures for the current biennium.	0
7. For official travel of staff, a total allotment of US$ 282,900 has been provided for 1996-97.	0
8. Consultancy resources made available during this period amount to US$ 505,800.	0
However, it should be borne in mind that these attributed costs constitute only part of the total costs of the activities, since the system of global reporting of other relevant costs (e.g. staff costs and communication costs) does not allow for the clear apportionment of all costs to each of the activities.	0
Each seminar has been organized at a cost of roughly US$ 8,000.	0
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures. 	1
We emphasize training, and we make sure that this process is regenerative. 	1
Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work? 	1
Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think." 	1
Support was also given for a subregional consultative meeting organised by the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Drylands (ACSAD) in Damascus (9-11 April 1997) and the Centre for Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE) in Cairo to explore options for subregional cooperation through cooperative arrangements such as the establishment of a Western Asian Network to Combat Desertification.	0
It aimed at identifying the framework and priority areas of the implementation strategy for the Regional Implementation Annex for Asia.	0
We have had walks every year -- every March, April. 	1
This conference laid the groundwork for the implementation of the Convention at the national and regional levels and agreed on measures of cooperation in the region.	0
The conference was followed by a meeting of the Regional Steering Committee (Mexico, 17-18 June 1997), which ratified the decisions taken in Havana during the conference.	0
- Support for the formulation of pilot projects in the Maghreb and Sahel border areas (i.e. Mauritania/Senegal and Algeria/Tunisia);	0
34. An important activity of the Secretariat is to raise public awareness of the problem of desertification and to promote the Convention and its implementation.	0
Ernest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained, and you can make it possible for everyone. 	1
Publications The Secretariat produced a Convention Kit and the simplified and information: version of the Convention in a booklet entitled "Down to Earth", both of which continue to be widely distributed in a number of languages.	0
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation, we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it, and how you can do it. If we do this, we can change the face of health care in Africa. 	1
Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa. 	1
And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares. 	1

And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. 	1
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure. 	1
Such involvement is promoted mainly in collaboration with inter-governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).	0
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart. 	1
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen? 	1
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking. 	1
43. Costs incurred in the current biennium through June 1997 in connection with the above grass-roots organizations' activities include US$ 23,500 in consultancies, US$ 290,000 for the travel of resource persons from NGOs, US$ 39,700 in staff travel to NGO/IGO activities, and US$ 442,000 in grant payments for the above activities.	0
(b) facilitate the participation of NGOs at the resumed Tenth INCD Session (Geneva, 18-22 August 1997) and at the COP 1 (Rome, 29 September-10 October 1997);	0
But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning. 	1
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.  And this happens constantly in the writing. 	1
(f) facilitate the preparation and holding of an NGO forum during COP 1;	0
 And they all operate at the same time. 	1
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said, "Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life." 	1

After deducting total estimated 1996-1997 expenditures of US$ 2,639,700 (inclusive of the 13% programme support costs) and after providing for the required 1997 operating cash reserve (estimated at US$ 204,700), a balance of approximately US$ 516,500 will remain available for 1998 assuming receipt of all outstanding pledged contributions in 1997.	0
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything. 	1

And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book. 	1
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things? 	1
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China. 	1
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm. 	1

Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new. 	1

List of activities which the Secretariat might support	0
I. ORGANIZATION OF NATIONAL AWARENESS SEMINARS AND OTHER PREPARATORY ACTIVITIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL	0
So, imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light. 	1
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself -- I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen. 	1
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s, this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away. 	1
So if these ideas are correct, this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. 	1
It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy, vibrating in different frequencies. 	1
1. Participation in meetings related to the Northern Mediterranean and in other task forces, inter-agency meetings and expert groups ($45,200).	0
8. Production of a video report (15-28 minutes) on a topic related to desertification ($56,500).	0
 But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? 	1
1. Facilitation of the exchange of NGO experiences and information by supporting and participating in some 5 subregional level NGO/Government fora ($137,100).	0
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. 	1
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry. 	1
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around -- they'll be there in a second -- right there, notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions. 	1
Based on current experience, it is projected that the travel of some 110 participants to the Second Conference of the Parties will be financed from the Special Voluntary Fund at an estimated cost of US$ 621,500, inclusive of 13% programme support costs.	0

So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton -- that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out, if the extra dimensions are real. 	1
And to me this is a really remarkable story, and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space -- didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage in which the events of the universe take place. 	1

And we re-create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector -- immense numbers. 	1
I refer to the decision at the tenth session of the Intergovernmental negotiating Committee for a Convention to Combat Desertification in January 1997 inviting IFAD and UNDP to make revised submissions concerning the Global Mechanism (GM).	0
The electron -- the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus -- held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing, the photon. 	1
 So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000, so it's a relatively recent picture. 	1
You know, they're a step in size from the entire observable universe. 	1
I want to know what this Higgs particle does." 	1
The purpose of the present submission is to respond to the January 1997 INCD 10 resolution A/AC.241/WG.I(X)/L.2. "Identification of an organization to house the Global Mechanism", which inter alia, "invites the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to submit to the interim secretariat, by 1 May 1997, revised versions of any new elements to their offers to house the Global Mechanism, as contained in document A/AC.241/33, including on the possibility of co-hosting and including the proposed administrative arrangements as well as proposed budgetary implications of the functioning of the Global Mechanism, taking full account of Annex I to this decision".	0
They're interacting with the Higgs field. 	1
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism, although it's the simplest we've been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC. 	1
. promoting actions leading to cooperation and coordination;	0
. mobilizing and channelling resources; and	0
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model -- you can calculate how these change -- is the forces, the three forces, other than gravity, almost seem to come together at one point. 	1
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the LHC. 	1
The initial period can be interpreted as a "preliminary development and testing phase", during which the GM must seek to develop its operational strategy, modus operandi and instruments.	0
In particular, it must identify its specific value added contributions to the financial dimension of ongoing and future efforts to combat desertification/drought.	0

This process may or may not involve financial participation by IFAD.	0
Even the very short experience of donors groups for NAPs indicates the potential problems.	0
The GM, benefitting from the experience of IFAD and its network of cooperating institutions, including the World Bank, regional and subregional development banks, the OPEC Fund, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), should provide advice and assistance in organizing the process of decision-making and disbursement by the participating donors.	0
Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning. 	1

The activities to be financed in this manner would range from awareness-building to grass-roots initiatives, particularly those linked to resource mobilization.	0
We're taking calls live on stage here at TED in Monterey. 	1
Do you have a laminated badge, Eleanor? 	1
Each multilateral and bilateral institution involved in technical assistance and investment keeps records of the projects and programmes prepared and financed using a computerized data system.	0
The GM should identify the potential partners and the sources of expertise required in both the technical and financial aspects of the programmes and projects.	0
It should also be able to suggest financial solutions tailored to specific needs, including multi-source/multi-channel arrangements.	0
But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters. 	1
And I always said that they were really tough on me. 	1
The report of the GM to the COP may contain data on the financial flows, their patterns, balance and gaps, on the demands not satisfied and on the under-utilized sources of funding.	0
When I was out with my friends drinking beer, I always was very aware of those words --  -- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. 	1
C. Promoting Actions Leading to Cooperation and Coordination	0
In fact, the GM functions as outlined in programme areas A and B should contribute to improved cooperation and coordination.	0
So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. 	1
I. GM STATUS WITHIN IFAD AND PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS	0
Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world, and call it the education market. 	1
It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions. 	1
The Managing Director could, therefore, report directly to the COP on behalf of the President of IFAD.	0
And the last piece, which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems. 	1

And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this, and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity. 	1
Let me come back to the beginning, to end this presentation. 	1
I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business, is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. 	1
I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. 	1
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know, I'm going to remind you again, that each generation has to do better than the last one. 	1
You have to be a better husband than I was, because that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense. 	1
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms -- otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --  -- and every organism had a right to vote, would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet? 	1
. financing critical activities that will influence the direction and magnitude of resources for the transfer of science and technology.	0
In view of the strong convergence between the people-centred approach called for in the Convention and IFAD's own orientation to participatory development at community and household levels, the Fund has been duly recognized by the INCD as an important vehicle for achieving CCD objectives both immediately in the Interim Period and after entry into force of the Convention.	0
The expertise in development finance includes programme design, appraisal and evaluation.	0
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta -- a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together. 	1
The Lending Policies and Criteria of IFAD specify that the Fund will "concentrate its resources upon activities that promise to achieve in a cost-effective way a reduction of poverty in rural areas where most poor people live and work".	0
Since the beginning of its operations, the Fund has committed over USD 3 billion for programmes in dryland areas with primary focus on local area development and has provided USD 165 million in technical assistance grants for agricultural research and related activities of technology transfer, institution building and training for resource poor farmers.	0
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing -- Internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. 	1
In 1997, the Fund successfully concluded its Fourth Replenishment under which members have pledged an additional amount of about USD 420 million.	0
A secondary source of external funding is provided under special programmes and supplementary fund agreements with donors of more than USD 500 million.	0
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven, biologically successful model. 	1
This coalition has enabled the Fund to develop a detailed knowledge of these agencies' modus operandi and lending requirements.	0
Contribution to this programme is received into a special account administered by IFAD.	0
They sporulated, the spores attract insects, the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae. 	1
Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky, and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons -- went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks. 	1
IFAD has formalized a consultative process with the NGO community whereby it holds an annual Forum in which NGOs from both North and South participate in discussing and reaching concrete conclusions on strengthening collaboration in the Fund's pipeline of programmes and projects.	0
The Popular Coalition to Eradicate Hunger and Poverty was founded at the Conference on Hunger and Poverty, held in Brussels in 1995.	0
The first phase was approved by the IFAD Governing Council in 1986, the second phase in 1991.	0
IFAD projects in this domain have succeeded because they have sought to address drought and desertification by promoting a transition to more sustainable land-use systems, rather than by introducing discrete "anti-desertification" measures in isolation.	0
Here's the selectivity index numbers -- against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses, compared to the ribavirin controls, we have an extraordinarily high activity. 	1
Within the context of NAPs, assistance will be required for a large number of communities and groups in identifying their needs and in pursuing medium and long-term projects in a flexible manner.	0
I was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form. 	1
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. 	1
Since IFAD's inception, the Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) Programme has provided USD 165 million for agricultural research and related activities of technology transfer, institution building and training.	0
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one. 	1

6. Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD)	0
These are a species that we need to join with. 	1
So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions. 	1
And a very closely related question, which is, how can we take control of this situation once we understand How can we make the harmful organisms more mild? 	1
And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative, more predator-like organisms. 	1
8. African Regional Centre for Technology (ARCT)	0
Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways. 	1
And when they're transmitted through the water, unlike the first two modes of transmission, these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission. 	1
Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was, how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild? 	1
In other words, this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms. 	1
And if you took a drop of that water, you might find a million diarrheal organisms. 	1
There's a little ethical problem in this experiment. 	1
Exchange rate with Italian lt 1,545 (22 Apr 1997)	0
So, this is very encouraging, it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow, if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck. 	1
UNDP AND THE GLOBAL MECHANISM of the UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION	0
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama. 	1
This paper is structured systematically to respond to the criteria as outlined in that document.	0
OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind. 	1
Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama. 	1
Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places. 	1
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone, sub-Saharan Africa. 	1
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria, you're certainly not going to eradicate. 	1
While information collection and dissemination, analyses and advisory services, and coordination functions are important, these functions may require a significant lead time before their effects can be felt.	0
So, this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. 	1
For an affected developing country with a heavy debt burden, resource degradation could be intensified where servicing of such debt leaves very little of the already limited public resources for supporting development of dryland areas.	0
Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems. 	1
And so if you do something with those systems, they're going to evolve one way or another. 	1
Furthermore, UNDP's mandate and activities have a direct bearing on the mission of the Global Mechanism.	0
Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about. 	1
- the Socio-Economic Monetary and Resource Tables (SMART Profiles), which provides additional information on official development financial commitments and related data by sector at national level, covering both the member countries of the Development Advisory Committee (DAC) of the OECD and developing countries.	0
2.1.7 Experience in forging public-private partnerships	0
This experience includes, for example its efforts to establish a Development and Finance Forum that brings together development professionals and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of financial institutions to examine ways in which private investment can foster social development, a collaborative agreement with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development - a group of 120 international companies and a joint programme with the Prince of Wales Business Leadership Forum, the World Bank and the Synergos Institute to document 'Best practices' in public-private partnerships.	0
And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael. 	1
You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights. 	1
2.3 UNDP: APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES OF TRANSPARENCY, NEUTRALITY AND UNIVERSALITY IN ITS OPERATIONS	0
But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. 	1
As an outgrowth of the Rio process, UNDP undertook a number of initiatives in this area, including establishing the Global Technology Group, for the purpose of helping to develop local products, assisting local private sector entrepreneurs and promoting south-north, south-south and north-south technology transfer.	0
Since 1996 UNDP is host to the CGIAR Impact Assessment and Evaluation Group (IAEG), a new body entrusted with monitoring, evaluating and communicating the outputs of the CGIAR programmes and their impacts on food security for the poor.	0
Nearly ninety percent of UNDP's core resources go to low income countries where the vast majority of the poor live, with eighty-five percent going to countries with annual per capita GNP of $750 or less.	0
As a response to the World Summit on Social Development (WSSD), UNDP launched the Poverty Strategies Initiative (PSI) focusing on: (i) advocacy and public awareness; (ii) poverty measurement and mapping; (iii) setting national goals and targets for poverty elimination; (iv) review of national policies and budgets; and (v) policy and institutional reform and coordination.	0
Micro-finance is now recognized as a key element of poverty eradication policies, and an important way for the poor to gain access to productive assets.	0
UNDP's anti-poverty work is both comprehensive and substantive. It involves a variety of activities; from advocacy and upstream work on policies, strategies, legal and institutional measures, to downstream work focused on facilitating access to credit and productive assets for the poor and other interventions.	0
In setting up the Global Mechanism, UNDP would be guided by the need for creativity and flexibility, in order to provide optimum conditions for the GM's work in promoting resource mobilization.	0
3.3 PROCEDURES FOR AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES	0
2. Initiate preparation of a detailed proposal concerning arrangements between UNDP and the COP as stipulated in the CCD .November-December 1997	0
3. Identify and develop collaborative arrangements with a small "consortium" of most concerned/relevant organizations, to support the Global MechanismOctober-December 1997	0
Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece, because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this. 	1
- delay before actual contributions begin to flow to support the work of the GM.	0
"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks. 	1
The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness. 	1
Of these countries, 34 have created Web pages.	0
  Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it, and I dance around a small stage so -- two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on -- what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it. 	1
As indicated above, UNDP foresees a small core staff for the Global Mechanism, as mentioned by several INCD delegations, possibly involving the following: (i) Head (Manager) of GM; (ii) two Resource mobilization officers (a private sector/investment expert and a specialist in Multi-bi funding arrangements); (iii) one Management Information Systems specialist; (iv) one advocacy/public relations expert.	0
And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves. 	1
It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space, of filling in the space. And then it started changing, and become folding on themselves. 	1
UNDP would also make arrangements with the organizations most concerned with the work of the GM (e.g Regional development banks, Multilateral financial institutions, etc) to designate focal points within their organizations, in order to build closer working relationships with them and facilitate partnership building for resource mobilization, to support CCD implementation.	0
- Domestic sources: This domain has not been sufficiently explored to support development activities.	0
UNDP would assist the GM develop partnerships with these NGOs to promote resource mobilization.	0
- Relevant UN agencies with programmable resources that can support implementation of the CCD.	0
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible. 	1
So, I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time. 	1
 And after 10 years of this, my wife eventually said, "Look, you know, you gotta do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine." 	1
- promote the use of UNDP's substantial grant resources to leverage additional resources, from bilateral, multilateral, private and public sources using well established mechanisms of co-financing, parallel financing, trust fund and other mechanisms.	0
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time. 	1
UNDP could facilitate the Global Mechanism's work of providing a range of advisory and analytical services to support resource mobilization efforts, including on:	0
- the establishment, financing and management of national desertification funds, building upon its experiences in supporting the design and establishment of NDFs in over twenty countries;	0
These would include, among others, NGOs, private sector research and academic institutions.	0
5.6 Context for establishing effective relationships with other entities	0
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before. 	1
If selected to house the GM, UNDP would help craft a small consortium of the most concerned organizations, involving partners (bilateral, private sector, government, civil society/NGOs, financial institutions, academic & research institutions, UN agencies, intergovernmental bodies, etc).	0
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice. 	1
ANNEX 1: UNDP's SUPPORT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION DURING THE INTERIM PHASE	0
For example, total core resources allocated by UNDP to support development activities in over 70 developing countries affected by desertification amounts to over US$ 1 billion for the period 1992-96.	0
At regional level, UNSO has provided assistance to the Asian NGOs' Conference on Desertification (Pakistan, January 1996) and to the Afro-Asian Forum for Implementation of the CCD (Beijing, August 1996).	0
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior. 	1
They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies. 	1

(c) procedures for the Conference to enter into agreements with the institution regarding Global Mechanism functions and modalities, including the nature, form and timing;	0
(f) projected costs of operation of the Global Mechanism, the extent to which the institution would absorb them and the nature of charges to the Conference of the Parties for costs not absorbed.	0
In summarizing the projected costs of operation of the Global Mechanism, it distinguishes between costs in 1998, when financing from the normal Convention budget will not be possible, and costs in 1999.	0

So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs. 	1
But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. 	1
In summarizing the projected costs of operation of the Global Mechanism, it distinguishes between costs in 1998, when financing from the normal Convention budget will not be possible, and costs in 1999.	0
And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. 	1
7. The third column, building on the scenario of UNDP housing, reflects the following UNDP views as communicated in a memorandum to the secretariat dated 5 September 1997:	0
Because of this and the uncertainty regarding paragraph 4 relating to the functions of the GM (on resource mobilization), it is our view that specific details such as the administrative structures, number of staff and their grades, location and office space, etc. should await the decision on the functions and hosting arrangements.”	0
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. 	1
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one. 	1
There was no marketing. There were no national brands. 	1
all staff recruited directly through competitive procedures; secondment would also be considered within this procedure 5 or 6 professional staff Possibly involving a head (manager), a private sector/investment expert, a specialist in multi-bi funding arrangements, a management information specialist and one advocacy/public relations expert.	0

Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. 	1
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like. 	1
requested international and multilateral organizations to provide support and mobilize necessary resources;	0
You think that that might be healthy food, but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list, it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. 	1
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. 	1
Those countries that already held national forums gained a consensus on the main lines of a national action programme and on the remaining steps to elaborate it.	0
The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) process led to a series of recommendations aimed at facilitating the elaboration of a subregional action programme for East Africa, as well as its harmonization with ongoing IGAD projects and with national action programmes being prepared in the subregion.	0
UMA experts came together in April 1997 at the organization's Rabat headquarters to invigorate the process.	0
At the regional level, the Pan-African conference held in Ouagadougou from 18 to 21 March 1997 constituted an important step in the implementation of the CCD in Africa.	0
And you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn, and we have other manifestations of space exploration. 	1
The Regional Conference on the Implementation of the CCD in New Delhi, started to define more precisely the scope and content of a regional action programme (RAP) to combat desertification in Asia and listed cross-cutting issues that would be reviewed under various themes.	0
It also mandated the continuation of regional cooperation initiatives and invited international organizations to provide financial and technical support to the preparation of the regional action programme.	0
The first regional meeting in Buenos Aires highlighted the necessity to strengthen regional coordination.	0
This process of coordination and reflection culminated in agreement at Murcia in May 1997 to:	0

And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want. 	1
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value. 	1
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together. 	1
But this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs, as the designers on the other side are doing the work. 	1
The following is proposed for establishing the networking:	0
And then, of course, design is never done. 	1
1. Collecting (from different sources) data, maps, reports, statistics and research results pertaining to the desertification phenomenon and how to deal with it at the national level, including the green belts.	0
Here's another project, which I think really emulates that. 	1
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop. 	1
: a work team composed of (1) expert, (3) engineers and a secretariat	0
— At the subregional level: fast means of communication + fax + electronic mail + computer	0
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea. 	1
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere. 	1
4. Practical cost-effective methodology to permit the CST to update the inventory of networks on a regular basis	0
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them. They were excited. 	1
(h) China National Center for Research and Development and Desertification Control is an open, high level, interdisciplinary and comprehensive research institution engaged in combating desertification.	0
Permanent Inter—State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS)	0
Now, when I went to college, I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines. 	1
And it's full of many little trivial end points, like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. 	1
— a variety of peripherals on the multitask machines: magnetic tape readers, Exabyte and TK 70 cassette players, optical discs and graphical and Postscript printers.	0
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought, it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long. 	1
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought, and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair." 	1
Two satellite reception stations at the Regional Centre and other units in the various countries complement the ground—based system for biological data collection.	0
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions, so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once. 	1
In each country, a national component serves as a technical way station for national—level AGHRYMET activities, from data collection, management and analysis to the generation and distribution of information.	0
The arrangements for follow—up and data collection at the national level rely on multidisciplinary working groups, coordinating bodies set up right at the national technical services, projects and institutes working in the same areas as the AGRHYMET Centre.	0
INSAH's mission in carrying out the CILSS mandate is to help member States, by means of research and development, to define strategies and set up programmes to help them attain food security without damaging the environment.	0
 So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. 	1
To accomplish its mission, INSAH has two (major) programmes: agro—socio—economic research, and population/development.	0
And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant. 	1
The strategic objective is to put forward options for easing demographic constraints on sustainable development in the Sahel.	0
It is easy to see that INSAH and the AGRHYMET Centre are institutions which have been conducting work similar to that planned by CST for over 20 years.	0
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in. 	1
The national teams will include specialists covering research and development, the training and research system at universities and specialized schools, the early—warning and forecasting system, NGOs and other private bodies.	0
1. Produce a method to be used uniformly by all national teams: terms of reference, evaluation criteria, survey questionnaire, national report outline;	0
4. Combine the national reports and submit the final report.	0
And when I had this thought, I was imagining that I would make -- I would have a whole machine theater evening, where I would -- you would have an audience, the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage. 	1
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals, are now, as they say, in diaspora. 	1
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map, and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of. 	1
The station is an important node in the African network; areas suitable for reclamation can thus be identified.	0
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country." 	1
2-(e) The purposes of strengthening networks at various levels are: Identification of causes of desertification problems and their impact on natural resources.	0
Some information concerning specific deteriorated resources is available whereas a lot of information is still lacking.	0
— Existence of specialized experimental research stations and pilot demonstrations areas.	0
These are a few of them. So, what did I do? 	1
We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw. 	1
We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart, but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. 	1
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do, because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced, does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine: multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction. 	1
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables. 	1
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much. 	1
These are members of my graduating class, 1986. 	1
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope. 	1
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice. 	1
A considerable amount of work has already been done internationally to survey institutions and organizations working in areas directly or indirectly related to action to combat desertification.	0
For example, a number of United Nations system organizations, such as FAO, UNDP and UNEP, had already produced listings of scientific institutions and organizations before the Convention to Combat Desertification was drafted.	0
And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet, but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. 	1
So, memetics: memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism. 	1
The means of investigation used (questionnaires included) must faithfully reflect the new requirements of the Convention and thus allow skills not yet sought in the domain of desertification proper to be made known.	0
Observation: the database produced should admit of dynamic management by the Committee on Science and Technology, but also by the institutions concerned.	0
If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. 	1
2. Put forward a strategy for the establishment of a worldwide support network for the implementation of CCD.	0
We're so used to thinking in terms of biology, we think about genes this way. 	1
The total budget for the services proposed is put at US$ 184,000.	0
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated. 	1
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme. 	1
It's important to stick with that definition. 	1
2.2. Work with co—contractors and the CCD interim secretariat on:	0
All the stories that we're telling -- well, of course, TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes. 	1
Some of them will be copied even though they're not. 	1
Production of documents on various media	0
Submitted to the interim secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification and Drought (CCD) for consideration of the by	0
SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes, but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one. 	1
The work plan of such a survey and evaluation activity for the CST will need to be broken down into three phases, namely: (1) identification of the principal potential units, particularly networks; (2) a pilot, in-depth survey and evaluation of potential units in a particular region and subregion; and (3) replication of the pilot survey and evaluation of units in other regions and subregions.	0
This consortium which is composed of: the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the University of Arizona, have agreed to collaborate in implementing this preliminary survey and evaluation of networks, as outlined in Section 6 of this document, and have submitted proposals to UNEP, on which this project proposal is based.	0
If the bid is successful such organizations would be requested to join or collaborate with the proposed consortium.	0
The memes are all trying to get copied -- trying, in inverted commas -- i.e., that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will. 	1
(b) Criteria for evaluation of institutions, agencies and networks developed;	0
All other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use and all these things that make us unique, are based upon genes. 	1
The point of memetics is to say, "Oh no, it doesn't." 	1
2. Identify networks/units to be contacted in Phase 1.	0
And like most parasites, it can begin dangerous, but then it coevolves and adapts, and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite. 	1

Each Consortium member involved in project implementation will estimate its aggregate cash requirements for each quarter, including a reasonable amount to cover “lead time” for the next remittance, and send a request accordingly to the Chief, Fund Programme Management Branch.	0
6. Institutional Framework, Responsibilities and Contributions	0
We've been asking it here at TED already. 	1
So, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence, we think replicators. 	1
The fraction of those that get the second replicator. 	1
OK, so if we take that equation, why haven't we heard from anybody out there? 	1
Desertification and Desert Cultivation Studies Centre (DADCSC)	0
But then, a long time later, billions of years later, we got the second replicator, the memes. 	1
IGAD subregion occupies the north-eastern horn of Africa and comprises the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.	0
It was initiated to strengthen local, national, subregional, regional and international cooperation and to give provisions of financial and technical support to developing countries so that these countries could effectively combat desertification and mitigate effects of drought by promoting sustainable development at the local community level according to the real need local people perceive.	0
Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through. 	1
We make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us, because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable. 	1
Will be in line with those presented in Annex 1 of terms of reference (TOR).	0
A questionnaire encompassing all pertinent questions and requirements to realize set tasks and thematic needs of articles 16-19 of UNCCD will be prepared.	0
When all the intended visits have been accomplished a draft Country Profile Paper (CPP) will be prepared and then a national workshop will be organized to discuss the CPP.	0
 Chris Anderson: That was an incredible talk. 	1
Six experts with the following specialization will be involved: Agriculture, Soil Science, Forestry, Socio-economics, Range Management and Desertification.	0
So, what did you do, last time you got serious? 	1
- Man-days = 5 (TCP) x 4 (days) x $150 = $ 3 000	0
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up. 	1
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high, but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. 	1
The question is, how is it going to help their development? 	1
In fact, if you've got good enough governance, there is no resource boom. 	1
Just to benchmark that threshold, it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s. 	1
III. COMMENTS BY ORGANIZATIONS ON THE ONGOING WORK ON INDICATORS	0
(a) UNEP will complete the second edition of a desertification atlas, probably in September 1997.	0
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNSO, in collaboration with UNEP and other institutions, are working on the formulation and design of a desertification evaluation and monitoring initiative taking due account of the socio-economic dimensions of desertification.	0
5. Pursuant to decision 10/9, adopted at the tenth session of INCD, the secretariat has continued the informal open-ended consultative process and brought together a group of participants in Ottawa, Canada, from 15 to 17 July 1997 with support from the Canadian, International Development Research Centre. The group’s mandate was to devote particular attention to the honing of implementation indicators and the development of a method of establishing impact indicators.	0
They got instant democracy in the 1990s: elections without checks and balances. 	1
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction. 	1
a) the existence of a national Environmental Action Plan for Sustainable Development should be added as an indicator as Annex 1.A.5;	0
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds. 	1
II. Elements for a Method to Determine Impact Indicators	0
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction. 	1
8. Noting the task to carry forward consultation on the development of benchmarks and indicators for assessing the implementation and impact of the CCD, the group recognizes two distinct uses of the term, "benchmark":	0
a) a representative site where detailed studies are conducted and results are extrapolated to a larger area that is represented by that site.	0
I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies, That unless we have an informed society, what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures: things that look good, but don't work. 	1
10. The group recommended that each party to the CCD undertake a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of the biophysical and socio-economic conditions of the affected areas and of capacities in their countries.	0
It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do. 	1
Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?" 	1
. If a given indicator is not available, select a suitable proxy.	0
i) a permanent network of representative sites based on agro-ecological homogeneity	0
ii) an environmental information system based on some database management procedures	0
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak. 	1
Metamaterials, unfortunately -- A, it only works on microwave, and B, it doesn't work all that well yet. 	1

In response to the INCD request, the Secretariat corresponded with INCD members and relevant regional and subregional bodies and organizations.	0
I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs, which is the finding of them. 	1

TECHNOLOGY ON INVENTORIES OF RESEARCH AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE, AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES	0
As to inventories of traditional and local technology, knowledge, know-how and practices, a number of initiatives have already taken place, particularly in the Sahel region.	0
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas. 	1
Separate subjective and objective variables are at play.	0
The CST could also then discuss and advise on participative and demand-driven methodologies for the setting of research priorities.	0
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought, "Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down." 	1
The present document contains some general information that may be helpful for participants.	0
It will be organized in two segments: an initial segment (29 September - 6 October 1997), and a high-level segment (7-10 October 1997).	0

He said, "Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you, 'Would you electrocute a stranger?' 'No way, I'm a good person.'" He said, "Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do?" 	1
And so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people. 	1

So, 500 years after Columbus, these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual. 	1
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb. 	1
They consume more coca leaves than any human population, half a pound per man, per day. 	1

This little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men's hut for all that time, until he begins his journey of initiation. 	1
We traveled high into the paramo, and as we crested the hills, we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity. 	1
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing. 	1
And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos, and yet, still they pray. 	1
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. 	1
Now, if we slip to another end of the world, I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming, inspired in part by the former Vice President's wonderful book. 	1
And what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the Inuit -- a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it. 	1
That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. 	1
So, you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual, social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away. 	1

And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer. 	1
You can see here, over at the end, our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos, and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. 	1
(a) Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations	0
And by the time we get around here, we get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail. 	1
If you go down to five percent, you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos. 	1
The Committee elected Mrs. Socorro Flores (Mexico) as Chairman of the Working Group on the United Nations Decade of International Law.	0
If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort, you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos. 	1
And that sounds strange to our ears, but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a below-average amount. 	1
You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work and you can get some output. 	1
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase. 	1

The fact that a single programmer can, to an institution, improve Linux once and never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer. 	1
In the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources -- she's a reporter for the New York Times -- her sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case. 	1
And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws. 	1
And so the shield law, as much as we want it -- we want a professional class of truth-tellers -- it is becoming increasingly incoherent, because the institution is becoming incoherent. 	1
In accordance with the decision taken at its resumed orga-nizational session on 5 September 1997, the Committee for Programme and Coordination will hold its resumed thirty- seventh session at United Nations Headquarters for up to 5 days beginning Monday, 13 October 1997, at 10 a.m. in the Economic and Social Council Chamber.	0

And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads. 	1
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? 	1
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further. 	1

Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him. 	1
It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence, but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence. 	1
And it was his universe on punch cards. 	1
And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity. 	1

And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet. 	1
So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms, and in the actual print of this piece, each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge. 	1
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material, and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print. 	1
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it. 	1
More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under begin smoking every year. 	1
 And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills, which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States, attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications. 	1
Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples. 	1
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. 	1
We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now, what's going on in our country, the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. 	1

 I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. 
 just 
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. 
 just 
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. 
 just 
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. 
 just 
This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. 
 just 
Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. 
well
We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. 
well
This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. 
 just 
They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice. 
well
You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. 
well
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. 
 just 
 That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. 
well
And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. 
you see
Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. 
well
One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. 
 just 
And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. 
 just 
 But once you see it, like you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. 
you see
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. 
 just 
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. 
i mean
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month. 
i mean
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water. 
i mean
 Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on. 
 just 
 So, you know, I do what I can with the students. 
you know
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead. 
you know
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. 
well
It's just cash. 
 just 
 You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. 
you know
But in my world -- you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded. 
you know
So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. 
 just 
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking. 
i mean
You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic. 
you see
You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. 
you know
You know, they engage. 
you know
AG: Certainly. Well, the first is, instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies, they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. 
well
You know, the aid system is broken. 
you know
Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion. 
you know
You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries. 
you know
If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period. 
you know
And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. 
 ok 
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up. 
 oh 
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. 
 ok 
Well, who was inspired during that time period? 
well
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. 
well
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. 
you know
Well, what did I do when I was a kid? 
well
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. 
well
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool. 
you know
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing -- by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. 
by the way
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. 
you know
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? 
well
There's another one announced just last week. 
 just 
 OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. 
 just 
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun." 
 just 
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't. 
well
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? 
well
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. 
well
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? 
you know
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is. 
well
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. 
 just 
This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. 
 just 
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this? 
you know
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. 
you see
Many people think, "Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that." 
well
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand. 
well
And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars. 
 just 
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function. 
 just 
We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth. 
 just 
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is. 
you know
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. 
well
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word "design" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know? 
you know
I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? 
you know
That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors. 
by the way
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this. 
well
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes. 
you know
They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else. 
well
Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you, because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships. 
well
So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. 
 just 
Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them. 
 just 
However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. 
you know
Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was -- these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions. 
well
And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon? 
you know
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product. 
i mean
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything. 
well
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK? 
 just 
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know. 
you know
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something? 
you know
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought, "You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. 
you know
By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America. 
by the way
One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that. 
you see
There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design. 
you know
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation as a side project from environmental organisms. 
 just 
We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. 
 just 
 We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. 
 just 
And we're in the process of sequencing all that Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. 
 just 
But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. 
 just 
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families? 
 just 
And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, "I heart my genitalium." 
you know
This is actually just a microorganism. 
 just 
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. 
 just 
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. 
 just 
The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. 
 just 
After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. 
 just 
And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability. 
 just 
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach. 
well
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. 
 just 
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this, to work out what the risk and benefits to society are, and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. 
 just 
People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. 
 just 
And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding. 
 just 
I'll show you what I mean. 
i mean
And the calls that -- you know how they say, "Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?" 
you know
So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. 
 just 
She goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"  Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got? 
well
I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. 
 just 
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. 
 just 
I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration. 
you know
They said, "Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. 
well
Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database." 
 just 
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, "Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday." 
well
 And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. 
you know
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. 
 just 
And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. 
you know
But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? 
i mean
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? 
you see
He goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter." 
well
On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. 
by the way
You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... 
you know
It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie "Evita" --  with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.  
you know
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. 
you see
I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather. 
 just 
This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. 
well
I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. 
 just 
Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. 
well
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. 
 just 
Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. 
 oh 
 In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. 
 just 
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. 
 just 
This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? 
you know
They just said, "We'll make this software work right." Right? 
 just 
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. 
i guess
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. 
well
Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much. 
 just 
JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point. 
you see
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. 
well
DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. 
well
It was just extraordinary. 
 just 
DR: Well, it's a funny thing. 
well
DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather." 
you know
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. 
 just 
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. 
well
So this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense." 
you know
KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? 
i guess
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site. 
 just 
And we said, "Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city. 
well
DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. 
well
KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before -- a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die," sort of sense of existence. 
i mean
You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. 
you know
I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it. 
 just 
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. 
well
DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. 
well
KA: Well, I think that's interesting. 
well
KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers? 
 just 
I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know, I'd like to see an international competition, and a call for ideas for uses. 
you know
What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous. 
 just 
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. 
 just 
This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down. 
i guess
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts. 
 just 
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars. 
by the way
And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around. 
 just 
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. 
 just 
I mean, what are we fighting over right now? 
i mean
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things. 
 just 
And every one of those industries, by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry. 
 just 
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane. 
i mean
But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work. 
 just 
A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- 
i mean
and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, "Can I try that?" 
 just 
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything? 
you know
And I figured, "It's all over now," and she looks up and she says, "Well," she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no, she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades," she knew them by name; she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle." 
well
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left, the sidewalks in these cities. 
 just 
But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry. 
well
Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems. 
 just 
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb. 
 just 
With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. 
 just 
Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.  Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the 
well
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. 
you see
 And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. 
you know
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 just 
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. 
by the way
And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better. 
 just 
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. 
well
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. 
by the way
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. 
 just 
They know mental as well as physical suffering. 
well
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. 
well
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. 
 just 
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end." 
 just 
Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? 
you know
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere. 
 just 
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago? 
you know
We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. 
well
As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be. 
you know
They were feeling despair, they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. 
well
We want to learn about animals. We want ... " You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. 
you know
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. 
 just 
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening." 
you see
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, "If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good." 
you see
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. 
 just 
And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books. 
 just 
There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover, and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book, and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey, I read that book, and from when I was reading that book, I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine. 
 just 
I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book, who went into the jungles of Africa, went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much. 
 just 
It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought, "Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid -- I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world." 
you know
But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway? 
i mean
So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year, and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system. 
i guess
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year, and it's continuing now as well, and found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine" had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent. 
well
And while I was reading all these articles about cancer, it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know, the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer -- tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes. 
you know
And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body, or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought, "Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of." 
well
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained. 
you know
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. 
i guess
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. 
i guess
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life. 
i guess
So first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well, cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis, which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow. 
well
And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. 
 just 
I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. 
i mean
It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle. 
 just 
If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost. 
i mean
These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way. 
 just 
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay. 
okay
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time. 
i mean
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought, but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life. 
you know
FG: Well, I've always just ... 
well
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars. 
 just 
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day. 
 just 
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time. 
 just 
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings. 
 just 
I just stopped. 
 just 
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me. 
i mean
Did you see that thing? 
you see
FG: But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context, I'm worried about the city, I'm worried about my client, I worry about budget, that I'm on time." 
you know
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity. 
i mean
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things, and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know? 
you know
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic. 
 just 
But you've got to -- yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ... 
well
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that. 
you know
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings. 
well
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner. 
 just 
They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project. 
you know
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long. 
well
But let me just say a couple words. 
 just 
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that. 
 just 
Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. 
 just 
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. 
 just 
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England. 
 just 
Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it. 
well
I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea. 
 just 
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. 
 just 
And indeed, that's what we do.  And then you just focus on this person. 
 just 
In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. 
 just 
He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me. But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. 
 just 
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. 
well
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. 
you know
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. 
 just 
I was just staggered by it. So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. 
 just 
You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. 
 just 
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. 
 just 
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. 
 just 
I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love. 
 just 
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. 
 just 
And there's also many more male idiots in the world.  When the male brain works well, it works extremely well. 
well
"Well, men are more adulterous!" 
well
They can go together, by the way. 
by the way
Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. 
 just 
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place. 
 just 
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know? 
you know
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one -- probably a true story. 
 just 
What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry. 
you know
We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature. 
well
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication." 
you know
So we went for a walk on the beach and I said, well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable. 
well
And they said, you know what happens is, mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up. 
you know
You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling? 
well
Why don't they just keep on going? 
 just 
And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. 
well
We're done. You know, I've seen that island. 
you know
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world. 
 just 
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions. 
well
That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. 
i mean
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything? 
 just 
A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time. 
you know
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase. 
 just 
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. 
 just 
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. 
 just 
Janine Benyus: Oh really? 
 oh 
CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down without seeing 10, 11 and 12. 
you know
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great. 
 just 
That means, you know, net fertility farming. 
you know
We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too. 
 oh 
And really, that's what other organisms do as well. 
well
This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out. 
i mean
Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it. 
 just 
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species. 
 just 
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are. 
you see
They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here. 
 just 
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines. 
well
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said, "Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars? 
well
They're not around anymore." Well actually, they are. 
well
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --  -- for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there. 
 just 
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample. 
well
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along. 
 just 
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters. 
 just 
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution. 
you see
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone. 
well
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said, "You know, there's this new thing called aspartame, and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. 
you know
They think, "Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy." 
well
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way." 
you know
"You know, let's just make an educated guess," and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle. 
you know
And he came back to them and he said, "You don't just need to improve your regular; you need to create zesty." 
 just 
And today, if you go to a really good supermarket, do you know how many Ragùs there are? 
you know
If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say? Every one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast." 
you know
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane. 
 just 
And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. 
well
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
You just get the reduction. Why? Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi. 
 just 
And she serves it that way time and time again, and if you quarrel with her, she will say, "You know what? You're wrong! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant." 
you know
Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. 
 just 
Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. 
 just 
I guess my cancer different from your cancer. 
i guess
Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. 
 just 
If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. 
 just 
And --  So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve-racking. 
you know
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see. 
you know
He makes enough money just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon. 
 just 
You're just like your dad," who collects instruments. 
 just 
But anyways, it's these sorts of personal stories -- You know, you read the blogs about politics or about media, and gossip and all these things. 
you know
You see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say, "Norman Rockwell is not art. 
well
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art." 
well
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories, and then you have this. 
you know
These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories. 
 just 
His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a -- just -- a disturbing image, but just so heartfelt. 
 just 
And you see this post. 
you see
We talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history. 
well
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today. 
 just 
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with, looking at constantly. 
well
And it's just these little things. 
 just 
Just doing this, I spent time in the archives -- that's why my husband's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives, just sitting there, looking for these things. 
 just 
And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past, what is '76? -- 20 ... Oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years? 
 oh 
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: You see all this math? I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set. 
you see
And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person. 
you know
And so you see these things, it's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look. 
you see
And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened -- you know, there was 100 people. 
you know
And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there. 
you know
We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there -- well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,  trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas. 
well
 So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker. 
you see
 Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias. 
well
Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment. 
well
  But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits. 
 just 
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do. 
 just 
They're just two different things. 
 just 
I mean, what's more likely: that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas to promote skeptic.com, our web page? 
i mean
 You can say a miracle occurs, it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything. 
 just 
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go. 
 just 
You see the happy face on Mars, there.  If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog. 
you see
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs. 
you see
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here? 
 just 
I guess you can only have one miracle per building. 
i guess
By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal. 
by the way
 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. 
 just 
 Couldn't you just listen to that all day? All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there. 
 just 
 I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story. 
 just 
Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice. At least she got it close. 
well
And so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song, in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge. 
well
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess. 
you know
That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars. 
well
Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking -- well, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed; I felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless. 
well
And it was an amazing learning experience because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had, you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly, it was something that happened to other people over there. 
you know
But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know, he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --  -- a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, just after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people 
you know
I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting, Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty, and it was an amazing experience. 
well
And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. 
well
And, I think, if we look around the world, as well as the polar ice caps melting, human rights, which have been fought for, for many hundreds of years in some cases, are, also, eroding very fast, and that is something that we need to take a look at and, maybe, start campaigning for. 
well
I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed, with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed, and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids, and that's questionable to start off. 
i mean
And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road, excuse me, Mr. Gabriel, would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit? 
 just 
Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you. 
 just 
But you can't say what you just saw never happened. 
 just 
All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS. 
 just 
There could be a new movement growing up, rising from the ground, reaching for the light, and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you. 
 just 
I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. 
 just 
That in fact, the publishing process -- just because of the fact that it's complicated, it's heavy, books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books, be they teachers, students or just general readers. 
 just 
OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages. 
 just 
So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors, but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world, and I think if you could do this, it would be called -- I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. 
 just 
So, really, this is the dream, and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world, I mean anyone in the world -- to be their own educational DJ, creating educational materials, sharing them with the world, constantly innovating on them. So, this is the dream. 
i mean
Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. 
 just 
Well, the first thing is, there's a community of engineering professors, from Cambridge to Kyoto, who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. 
well
And to them, this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important, because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism -- that if you don't empower people with the ability to re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language and take ownership of it, it's not good. 
 just 
Well, what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks. 
well
And I'll just give you my personal story. 
 just 
I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math -- Wow, about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation. 
 just 
And people who are teachers out here -- whoever taught, you know this -- it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about. 
you know
Not just text, but music, images, video. 
 just 
OK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points. 
 just 
We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site. 
 just 
So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this as a call to action. 
 just 
I just wish it were more organized." 
 just 
Take the money; go to Amazon; buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language. 
well
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals. 
 just 
So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be mortal, huh? 
i guess
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop! -- I'd go wireless. 
 just 
I guess it's just like life. 
 just 
They are first cousins, and you know what happens when, you know -- So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk. 
you know
 OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. 
well
We respond so well to form. 
well
I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. 
you see
I don't want to sound pretentious saying that, but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago -- well into the 21st century, 500 years later. 
well
Here you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic. 
you see
It's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible. 
 just 
I don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry; I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature -- nature improves with ever-greater purpose that which once existed, and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. 
you know
I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. 
 just 
It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it, you see human beings. 
you see
When you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. 
you see
It contributes immensely to our -- sense of being, our sense of relationships with things, our sensuality and, you know, the sort of -- even the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important. 
you know
Those holes you see there are very filtered-down, watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. 
you see
If you see the shadows that come through that, they're actually probably more important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes. 
you see
When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away. 
 oh 
Some guy's got that on a computer -- there's this like, oh my goodness. 
 oh 
I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. 
 just 
What a waste. Anyway.  No, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean --  I'm delivering; they're not taking. I've had this image 20 years. 
you know
You see that thing. You do. You do. 
you see
So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. 
 just 
It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. 
 just 
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours. 
well
I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting, in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad, over and over again until they bought it. 
i mean
That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to. 
 just 
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago, with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek. 
 just 
 So consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something, or people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article. 
you know
Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care. 
 just 
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. 
 just 
And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before. 
you see
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too. 
i mean
It has a strategy, and what they do is, they enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku, and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street. 
 just 
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product. 
 just 
That is a remarkable piece of art. You don't have to like it, but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable.  Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum; he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see. 
 just 
Now, at countless meetings at, you know, the Portland City Council, or who knows where, they said, we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry? 
you know
There was money, there was drugs, guns, women, you know, you name it -- jewelry, bling-bling -- it had it all. 
you know
So before I do that, just one warning, which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. It contains adult themes, adult language. 
 just 
As a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power -- it's a pretty good life -- but the thing was, in the end, you were living at home with your mother. 
you know
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell, crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city. 
well
I don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it, I would say that in the last 25 years, of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country, the biggest one in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city, was crack cocaine. 
well
He took one look at Sudhir, who was going to go do some surveys for him, and decided he knew exactly the place to send him, which was to one of the toughest, most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago, but in the entire United States. 
 just 
The first building? Well, there's nobody there. 
well
But he hears some voices up in the stairwell, so he climbs up the stairwell, comes around the corner, and finds a group of young African-American men playing dice. 
well
 So his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say, well, OK -- let's hear your questions on your survey. 
well
He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell. 
well
And you and I, probably, faced with the situation, would think, "I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead, I've been following them for the last three months." 
i guess
What did we find in the gang? Well, let me say one thing: We really got access to everybody in the gang. 
well
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang, 
 just 
I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like. 
you know
Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise, which, it turned out, for this black gang, was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook. 
well
The guys who are running the local gangs -- the four-square-block by four-square-block areas -- they're just like the guys, in some sense, who are running the McDonald's. 
 just 
And important to note is that almost all of the weight, all of the people in this organization are at the bottom -- just like McDonald's. 
 just 
So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chance that they're like them. 
 just 
It was below the minimum wage. And this is well-documented. 
well
Well, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. 
well
To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack -- and I'm not really focusing on the negatives, but really, there's another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates just of random, young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States, the death rates during crack were about one percent. 
 just 
In some sense, that's what happened, exactly, to the set of people we were looking at. They were willing to start at the bottom, just like, say, a first-year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom, work 80-hour weeks for not that much money, because they think they're going to make partner. 
 just 
So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more, is that, really, they didn't own those cars -- they just leased them, because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars. 
 just 
It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real. 
you know
They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot -- One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang: if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory -- people are afraid to go buy drugs there, they're going to come into your neighborhood. 
 just 
Here's what he says about why they don't do that: "If we start shooting around there, the other gang's territory, nobody, I mean, you dig it, nobody gonna step on their turf. 
i mean
They had their two cures. Until a particular mother, whose child had just turned two, died of this disease. 
 just 
And she thought to herself, "My child just turned two, and until the child turned two, I had always used this complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment. 
you know
And she told all the other people, and she said, "How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive?" 
well
And the people thought, "You know, you're right. 
you know
And so, he went forth to the people and he said, "I've made this wonderful finding: it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution, and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year, and we could spend that on our children in other ways." 
 just 
So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website -- you can just look at the raw data, that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up. 
 just 
If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data, 19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt, 16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you that the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. 
 just 
And this is all relative to unrestrained -- the bigger the bar, the better. Okay. 
okay
So, this is the data I just showed, OK? 
 just 
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. 
well
And it's not just overall. It's very robust to anything you want to look at. 
 just 
One thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes -- when the car crashes, the front hits into something -- indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. 
you see
But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes, indeed, the car seats don't perform as well. 
well
And the other thing you might argue is, "Well, car seats have got a lot better over time. 
well
They say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be." 
well
It's kind of an interesting logic, I think, that people use. And the other logic, they say, "Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much. 
well
Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know -- it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it. 
you know
So they just have these bench seats, and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it. 
 just 
So I just wanted you to look at this. 
 just 
It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. 
well
These are three-year-old dummies, by the way. 
by the way
And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat, OK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well. 
well
So this car seat was actually an above-average car seat from Consumer Reports, and did quite well. 
well
Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500 out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something. 
you know
But still, if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat. 
 just 
So, in some sense, what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong, which is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally, the car seats aren't doing much. 
 just 
So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time, so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat -- at rebound, it takes a lot longer -- but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt. 
 just 
So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well. 
well
And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt, and in fact, they get exactly within, you know, within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old, the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever. 
you know
And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes, which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do, is something that scientists don't actually, usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory, a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies, than actually 30 years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats. 
 just 
And if you think from a design perspective, about going back to square one, and say, "I just want to protect kids in the back seat." 
 just 
I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say, "Well, the right way to start would be, let's make a great seat belt for adults. 
well
I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids? 
i mean
It's just actually -- you see, this is folding up -- it's behind the seat. 
you see
People would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so big and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better, you know, what possibly could?" 
you know
So, my dad always took that as evidence that this little, teeny, powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story, I think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly, becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion is, well, maybe after coming to my father three times, getting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick, he went and found another doctor. 
well
 (Audience: I just wanted to ask you, when we wear seatbelts we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life, it's also to prevent lots of serious injury. 
 just 
Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury? Because that would prove your case.) Steven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes, I find very small differences in injury. 
 just 
In the New Jersey data, which is different, because it's not just fatal crashes, but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported, it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries, but generally they're the minor injuries. 
 just 
And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations, of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations, the naysayers. 
well
This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process, which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it. 
 just 
There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to. 
 just 
Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope. 
well
This will be the first building in the United States that took -- well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid. 
well
10 of these -- it's just under a million square feet -- 800 and some thousand square feet -- 10 of these would power Sausalito -- the delta on this. 
 just 
Well, I could also start here. 
well
Well, our research -- my generation for sure, people who were going to school in the late '60s -- made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture, looking at architecture within its own territory, and we were much more affected by film, by what was going on in the art world, etc. 
well
And then -- well, he was probably looking at this -- this is Nazca; this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures. 
well
They're just totally incredible. 
 just 
This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona -- well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea. 
well
I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X, Y and Z function. 
 just 
And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea. 
 just 
And what we really want to do -- well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site, 
well
And again we just finished the ECB -- actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project, where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park, which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric -- the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city. 
 just 
And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it, 
 just 
And what I want to talk about -- this is the Supreme Court, of course -- and, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon. 
well
Well, then we get to this image. 
well
You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture, and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters. 
you know
When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too. 
you know
I just did things. 
 just 
Though it's actually true, you know, the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil. 
you know
You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s under a climate of political distress, and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way -- in a sort of a semiotic black market. 
you know
And also -- advertising people do that all the time --  -- and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car, the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun -- I don't know why he had a gun -- and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor. 
well
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot.   Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images. 
well
You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach. 
you know
Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do -- I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do.  But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know, they would only let me do other things. 
you know
But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud. 
you know
So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing -- you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire. 
you know
The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know? 
you know
It was just the name of the child, with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly. 
 just 
Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting, because, you know, you go to that -- you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily, like a face, goes into becoming just a texture. 
you know
Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor. 
you know
You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know? 
you know
This is something I used to do as a joke -- you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" -- and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop. 
you know
But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original. 
 just 
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there. 
you see
And this is another thing that I did -- you know working -- everybody loves to watch somebody draw, but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in -- a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing. 
you know
On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think -- and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group. 
you know
And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy -- his name was Joey Grimaldi -- he impersonated the Moorish general -- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general, and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so -- plumber, general, plumber, general -- so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one. 
you know
Well, I think that's it. 
well
The theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies -- gobbledygook that we sell to Congress, because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. 
 just 
But they said to us, "You know what? 
you know
It's just too damn hard. 
 just 
We don't do the everything else so well. 
well
Argentina just went through it, broke a lot of rules. 
 just 
That's called the Powell Doctrine. 
well
Why? Because they just got fed up. 
 just 
They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. 
 just 
We did it just like that. 
 just 
Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets, which you cannot do, but maximum rule sets which you must do. 
 just 
It makes me very popular as well. 
well
What do I mean by these two different forces? 
i mean
I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years, we can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal. 
 just 
You'll see the pattern -- airborne, just like carriers. 
 just 
They said, "Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff." 
well
And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. 
 just 
And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama. 
 just 
And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns, many of which I had just interviewed, and heard their stories, and I watched their faces, and they gave us a little FM radio, and we could listen to the translation of his teachings. 
 just 
And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. 
 just 
And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. 
well
And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet. 
 just 
You know, violence as a political tool is all the rage right now. 
you know
He's the shaman of the Huaorani, and he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now; I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired of spearing these oil workers. 
you know
I wish they would just go away. 
 just 
 just before 9/11 -- August of 2001 -- I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan. 
 just 
Because at first I wanted -- you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips, but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less. 
you know
By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well. 
well
You know, getting kids used to different realities, I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions, just to make a mental flexibility, give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -- I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place. 
you know
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best. 
 just 
So our dream is to bring teenagers together, so they'll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience, as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure. 
well
National Geographic just did a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries. 
 just 
And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago. 
 just 
We just had a workshop in Guatemala. 
 just 
Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared. 
well
And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it. 
you know
 And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --  -- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it. 
you know
But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know, raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican, but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat. 
you know
I guess, you know, he was the big hero. 
you know
And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution. 
you know
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. 
you know
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life? 
you know
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of, how did you copy the information? 
you know
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance. 
you know
And it was at Indiana I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA. 
you know
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring. 
well
It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was; it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book. 
you know
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph. 
you know
So I went to Cambridge, because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject in, you know, chemistry departments. 
you know
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists. 
i mean
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model, an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know, length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs. 
you know
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up? 
 just 
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts. 
you know
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped. 
you know
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap. 
 just 
 So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --  -- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups. 
you know
Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven, those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist. 
well
 And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong. 
you know
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models. 
well
Well, of course, I wanted to build models. 
well
And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know, in one sense she was a chemist, but really she would have been trained -- she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry. 
you know
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. 
you know
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53. 
well
I just put them down like they were in the books. 
 just 
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right." 
well
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours. 
you know
And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism. 
you know
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme. 
well
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right. 
well
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA. 
 just 
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time. 
you know
 And so I didn't really get happy until 1960, because then we found out, basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA. 
you know
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA -- put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine, polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code, and it was all over by 1966. 
you know
Well, at that time -- I should go back. 
well
At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things. 
you know
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is: How do you nature-nurture? 
you know
So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well, if we're around here, you know, these little losses or gains might not be too bad. 
well
Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism. 
 just 
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA. 
 just 
I mean, big piece at the molecular level. 
i mean
We saw one autistic kid, about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes. 
 just 
Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars. 
 just 
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal. 
you know
Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think, oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know, children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK? 
you know
They develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other, room, after room, after room. 
 just 
The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey. 
you see
They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio, and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. 
 just 
So, that's just a rock in the hillside. 
 just 
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built. 
 just 
But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. 
you know
And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. 
 just 
It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. 
 just 
And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website. 
 just 
And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. 
 just 
People are always asking, "Well, who's in charge of this?" 
well
So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, "Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish." 
 just 
The reporters called me up and they -- I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, "They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia." 
i mean
The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn't because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... 
 just 
And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that. That's not a good thing. 
you know
And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change. 
 just 
So, Chris was able to do his change -- he didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change. 
 just 
That sounds suspicious. Who is this person? Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this. 
well
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. 
 just 
So, I mentioned earlier, people type "ASDFASDF" -- it needs to be deleted. Cases like that, the administrators just delete it. 
 just 
And what's interesting about this is that the software is -- these votes are just text typed into a page. 
 just 
I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. 
 just 
And I always embarrass her because I say, "Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful." 
well
But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. 
you know
Well, I don't like the term "benevolent dictator," and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. 
well
It just isn't appropriate. 
 just 
So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, "Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. 
well
Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. 
well
Then I said, "Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules." 
well
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education? 
you see
And I said, "Well, they don't all hate it." 
well
Well, it's great to be here. 
well
And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future. 
well
I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is. 
 just 
So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species, the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage -- and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb -- so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination, and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology. 
by the way
Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened, but some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line." 
well
So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers, like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point; these were just lists in reference works, and I think that's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution. 
 just 
But you see a very clear trend. 
you see
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth, is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology. 
 just 
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph -- by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth -- that's another exponential. 
by the way
Moore's Law was just the last part of that, where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit, but we had electro-mechanical calculators, relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code, vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower, discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law. 
 just 
We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension. 
well
We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years, of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work. 
 just 
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. 
well
I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment, but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products, IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs. 
i mean
And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing; it's true of brain scanning; it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify, we have hundreds of different measurements of different, information-related measurements -- capacity, adoption rates -- and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months, depending on what you're looking at. 
 just 
I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago. 
i mean
One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene, basically says, "Hold onto every calorie, because the next hunting season may not work out so well." 
well
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this, felt that would be interesting drug for the human market, and that's just one of the 30,000 genes that affect our biochemistry. 
 just 
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers. 
 just 
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain, and in fact not surprisingly, the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. 
well
Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence, and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated, and we'd never catch up to it. 
well
This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well -- in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception. 
well
You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust? 
well
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was, but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models, they figured, well, that was wrong, and then we had this bust. 
well
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios. 
 just 
I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal. 
i mean
But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines. 
 just 
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course. 
well
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it. 
you know
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. 
i mean
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time. 
well
It's not just about life, of course --  -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, So really, this is how I would like to describe it. 
you know
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. 
i mean
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. 
well
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. 
you know
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say. 
you know
People worry about overpopulation; they say, "Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. 
well
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this. 
you know
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that. 
you know
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. 
you know
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure. 
you know
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. 
well
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it? 
i mean
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer." 
well
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. 
you see
And you see it in all sorts of technologies. 
you see
Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. 
you know
 Well, it seems to get the point across. 
well
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --  -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes. 
you know
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it. 
well
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete. 
 just 
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list. 
 just 
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. 
you know
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. 
i mean
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. 
well
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. 
you know
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true. 
you know
And we'll just end with a few things. 
 just 
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible." 
well
And you know what happened. 
you know
So, you know, this does happen. 
you know
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq? 
i mean
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete? 
 just 
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months? 
you know
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems, they include education, sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. 
 just 
Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s. 
 just 
It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids, even though English wasn't their language, the Latin alphabet barely was their language, but they could just swim like fish. 
 just 
They just use Skype. 
 just 
So when you see that kind of thing -- this is not something that you have to test. 
you see
Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it, and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well. 
well
It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. 
 just 
And they said, "Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan." 
well
I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team. 
i mean
Well, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. 
well
And the fun part -- and I'm quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser -- I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard. 
 just 
It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512. 
 just 
It worked really well. 
well
The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network, and then just need one or two points of backhaul. 
 just 
So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well. 
well
Well, you can't see it. 
well
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. 
 just 
And it's clearly just a model. 
 just 
At least you can decide whether it goes left or -- Chris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast -- Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit. 
 just 
It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level," because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size. 
 just 
Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. 
well
And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world every three weeks. 
 just 
Well, guess what, we're not. 
well
The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique -- It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles -- thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. 
 just 
I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen. 
 just 
I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting. 
i mean
Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared. 
well
And let me just run through a few slides. 
 just 
And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe. 
 just 
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges. 
you see
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom, you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop. 
you see
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged. 
well
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies. 
you see
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. 
 just 
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours, but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, and we're imprisoned in our three. 
 just 
Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality. 
 just 
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems, one galaxy to many galaxies, we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang, perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties. 
 just 
Well, let's go back to this picture. 
well
Well, most of you anyway. 
well
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind on disaster. 
 just 
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones. 
well
We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well. 
well
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist, just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. 
 just 
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth. 
 just 
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history, the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. 
 just 
Within just 50 years -- that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age -- the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously fast. 
 just 
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh! You know, look what's really going on." 
you know
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever. 
you know
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo. 
 just 
He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time. 
 just 
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious. 
you know
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities. 
 just 
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here. 
 just 
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to. 
 just 
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there. 
okay
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order." 
i mean
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation. 
you know
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win. 
i mean
It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important. 
 just 
If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die. 
 just 
Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points; these are -- let's see, how far have I talked? 
you see
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died. 
 just 
I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular. 
 just 
Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising. 
well
Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation. 
 just 
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant. 
 just 
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve. 
 just 
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority. 
 just 
Think about some time in your life -- some people might never have experienced it -- but some people, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic. 
 just 
It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage. 
 just 
Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best. 
 just 
You just want to cling onto this. 
 just 
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best. 
 just 
We might end up with something like this, which is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that. 
i mean
And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. 
 just 
On my wish list, at least, would be: much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being, enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding, unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits, better relationships, an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral and intellectual development. 
well
Not just the world around us, but we, ourselves. 
 just 
Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are -- our very biology. 
 just 
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people. 
well
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement, vision enhancement, anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted, but just think about how great progress that is -- like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun. 
 just 
And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition. 
 just 
But part of the reason -- and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. 
 just 
We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it. 
 just 
Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music. 
 just 
And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. 
 just 
But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value. 
 just 
Greater subjective well-being. 
well
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this. 
 just 
It's just a single gene. 
 just 
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are. 
 just 
Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful. 
well
 Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here. 
well
 I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design? 
i mean
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that. 
well
And, you know what? 
you know
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. 
i mean
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school. 
i mean
 But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better. 
well
Like the speaker before me -- I am a TED virgin, I guess. 
i guess
And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. 
 just 
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called "Sync and Flow," I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?" 
well
What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. 
 just 
Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art. 
you know
For a more grandiose effect, I guess. 
i guess
So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time. 
you know
GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E. 
 ok 
As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on. 
 just 
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.  And they are. So let me start with the second one: "Typical." Well, is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum --  and that's not typical of the universe at all. 
well
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies. 
you see
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. 
well
Well, not quite, not quite perfect. 
well
You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark. 
you see
Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars. "Quasars" originally meant "quasi-stellar object," which means "things that look a bit like stars."  And we know what they are. Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed 
well
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure. 
well
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis. 
well
And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence. 
 just 
As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet. 
 just 
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.  Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. 
 just 
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. 
well
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much,  and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. 
 just 
So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. 
 just 
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman. 
 just 
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance. 
 just 
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival. 
 just 
And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it, I would have said, "Well, you know, if we look at the next 100 years and we've seen all these problems in the last few days, most of the big issues -- clean water, clean energy -- and they're interchangeable in some respects -- and cleaner, more functional materials -- they all look to me to be hardware problems. 
well
And I've always been nervous about the term "futurist," because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it. 
you see
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?" 
well
This is a silicon wafer, and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up. 
 just 
You know, high science uses air hockey tables --  -- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy, but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here. 
you know
Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. 
well
So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version: Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing? 
you know
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits. 
you know
So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently. 
you know
And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs for programming the physical universe? 
you know
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point, but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers. 
 just 
You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here. 
you know
That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape. 
you know
I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this. 
 just 
You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said, "How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity?" 
you know
I don't know exactly how to do this yet, but, you know, it's something being actively thought about. 
you know
So, you know, that leads to questions like, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine? 
you know
Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know, this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy. 
you know
But, you know, this is another way to look at the -- if you abstract again, this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe. 
you know
You could just hang it as a bed sheet, but again, the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape. 
 just 
And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. 
you see
Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, "You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. 
you know
 We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally. 
 just 
So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes. 
you see
It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. 
 just 
Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions. 
 just 
We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building. 
well
In fact -- and you know this -- this is called the Time Warner Building. 
you know
And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong. 
you know
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here. 
well
 However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to as "moments that take your breath away." 
you know
 What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design. 
 just 
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. 
 just 
And The Police's "Synchronicity" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. 
 just 
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects. 
you know
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss. 
you know
 So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. 
well
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because -- well, also, with an eye on this conference. 
well
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles. 
you know
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more. 
you know
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time. 
you know
This is, you know, a book. 
you know
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish. 
you know
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view. 
you know
This is, you know, the movie poster. 
you know
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me. 
 just 
 I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy. 
i mean
You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky. 
 just 
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud" a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well. 
well
And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters. 
 just 
 I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins. 
well
 Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while: You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing? 
well
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know, just to see what I actually like about my job. 
you know
You know, one is: just working without pressure. 
you know
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio. 
you know
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me. 
you know
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine? 
 just 
And the whole thing just fell together. 
 just 
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned -- in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" -- and we made these spreads right out of this. 
 just 
So I just picked another one. 
 just 
This is: "Having" -- this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side. 
you know
This was a simple sign error, because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel, as is well known to companies that do it all the time -- for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics. 
well
But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally, but completely -- quite the contrary. The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. 
 just 
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example. 
well
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned, to happen sooner and with higher confidence, then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk -- then you might like some light-handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic. 
 just 
This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds, and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this. 
well
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon. 
well
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. 
well
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. 
 just 
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight. 
 just 
We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material, and then ways to thermoform it, because it's a combination of carbon and nylon, into whatever complex shapes you want, like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers. 
 just 
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, 
well
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us. 
 just 
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class, in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three. 
 just 
This expands choice rapidly in the market, and actually makes more money for automakers as well. 
well
Well, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods. 
well
However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. 
 just 
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. 
well
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. 
well
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. 
 just 
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. 
 just 
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. 
well
They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. 
well
We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. 
well
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. 
well
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. 
by the way
Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. 
 just 
So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole. 
 just 
And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up on our reconstruction work. 
well
So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. 
you know
This isn't just about nonprofit. 
 just 
So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals. 
 just 
And we started engaging the medical community, and you know, we thought we were real bright sparks -- "We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa." 
you know
We know this. We just don't know how to show this." 
 just 
So you know, this is a serious solution. 
you know
This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. 
 just 
 Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. 
well
This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania. 
 just 
It's built, it's running and she just started a business today, where she's washing other people's clothes. 
 just 
This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year. 
 just 
From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 -- that's how old I am. So it's a young -- I just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed toilet in the world. 
 just 
But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York, but this. And when you look at this, you see crisis. 
you see
You have a diverse community of participants -- and we're not just talking about inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. 
 just 
Because you know what? Innovation will happen. 
you know
CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec. 
 just 
CS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart. 
well
And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens? 
you know
And I always answered, "Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for." 
well
Well, then you'd be screwed, because you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish, and now, since we only have one wish -- unlike last year they had three wishes -- I'm not going to wish for that. 
well
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen. 
 just 
I met people that live seven people to a room, barely can afford their evening meal, yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities. 
 just 
I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were, you know, very pretty photographs and I was like, "I failed at this." 
you know
And I was watching television in New York, and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across, and the coverage went from the US State Department to embedded troops. 
 just 
I just wanted to be in the center. 
 just 
So, the impact that had on me -- me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. 
 just 
In the Arab world -- and it's not really by the film, it's by the characters -- I mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. 
i mean
You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to -- we feel like we have to get the power to change things. 
you know
This woman came up to me after the screening and said, "You know, I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes, I saw the military going out to war, but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble? 
you know
Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders, I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. 
 just 
[Will we win that way?] [Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?] [And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on?] [Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?] [Woman: Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.] [Man: How, if Israel has no morals?] [Woman: Be careful!] [Tzvika: My wife Ayelet called me and said, ] ["There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv."] [Ayelet: What do you know about the casualties?] 
you know
There's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace, and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool, to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. 
 just 
Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live, or just a character that defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song. 
 just 
You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. 
you know
And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better. 
 just 
I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time. 
i guess
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way. 
you see
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto, and not have to re-invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life's work, and just research and find out where these industries are. 
 just 
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age. 
well
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles, and what we're doing to that landscape -- that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate. 
well
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago, and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind, not to mention that China, as well, has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around. 
well
I came out of a blue-collar town, a GM town, and my father worked at GM, so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know, to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something. 
you know
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam, and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man. 
you see
Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said, "It's just too big." 
 just 
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that. 
you see
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess, what we know here, in terms of urban planning. 
i guess
And also, like right now, they're just moving. 
 just 
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen. 
 just 
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area. And the density is quite incredible. 
well
And it was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable. 
 just 
It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible. 
 just 
They were just wound up doing these things all day long, until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say, "Okay, everybody freeze." 
 just 
So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines. 
 just 
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken. 
 just 
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect. 
 just 
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution, because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well. 
well
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind, hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere. 
 just 
And it just started about 14 months ago. 
 just 
And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, "Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?" 
well
And you think about it, you know, grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason, so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty. 
you know
So it's this great window where they actually are -- you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty? 
you know
You know, we know that from earlier presentations. 
you know
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday. 
 just 
Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack? 
well
Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm, vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone. 
well
So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first, and the best model for this happens to be pigs. 
 just 
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin, like you see in an emergency room, and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well. 
well
Well, with the pig, at the baseline, before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal. 
well
After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference, and after three minutes -- well, if you really studied it, you'd see a difference. 
well
Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery, to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is. 
well
Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here, then this rise -- that's the ST elevation. 
you see
And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece, which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker, with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker. 
you see
Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device, and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it. 
well
Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there? 
you see
Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation? 
you see
Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats -- this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line. 
 just 
Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life, because we need to do this type of animal research for humans. 
well
Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion. 
well
If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law, which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water -- that's your brains by the way -- it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache. 
by the way
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights, gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. 
by the way
And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10. 
well
Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News, Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news. 
well
Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange. 
well
 You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches, and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it. 
you see
Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers, is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once. 
 just 
Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" means that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus," which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there, that it's going to happen, and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot, which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache. 
well
Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy, as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it, that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders. 
well
If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well. 
well
The comprehensive solution: this is the device; it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough, just the thickness of most cranial bones. 
 just 
Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal, which means they did not get the epileptic seizure. 
you see
 I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa. 
well
Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else? 
well
And consider treating psychotic disorders -- and I want this involved with the TED group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans. 
well
Well, that's the good news. 
well
 Well, the third and final wish is somewhat -- unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers. 
well
 Well, medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance, so that competent physicians are leaving their practice. 
well
Well, how can the TED community help with this situation? 
well
Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation. 
well
Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that. 
 oh 
Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand. 
well
These are just some starting points. 
 just 
Now, you know from the '60s, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus. 
you know
 This is just like a residency program, for those of you that are in medical school. 
 just 
You're a mother and you're watching your child, and on day six, you see pustules that become hard. 
you see
Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. 
 um
And by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen, but you know this child has no other secondary infection. 
you know
It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. 
 just 
It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. 
 just 
I was just in India working on the polio program. 
 just 
We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage, with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission, but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission. 
 just 
First of all, just so everyone understands: you're saying that by creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? 
 just 
LB: Well, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. 
well
Well, they're only crawling in seven languages. 
well
Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call, "Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?" 
well
 I just really want to thank you very much. 
 just 
And though I'm a rock star, I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub. 
 just 
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players. 
 just 
You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song, you needed a studio and a producer. 
you see
Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind. 
 just 
Well, I turned him down. 
well
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. 
you see
You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami. 
you see
The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough, it would appear. 
 just 
Well, why aren't we? 
well
Doesn't compassion look well on us? 
well
And I say that as a fan, you know? 
you know
You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference. 
you see
Well, much more than we think. 
well
Well, now, actually because of you, it is possible to change the physical world. 
well
Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right. 
well
We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable. 
 just 
What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree, is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it. 
 just 
A lot of people are getting together, and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign. 
 um
I think they just have one idea in their mind, which is, where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world. 
 just 
Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for. 
 just 
 This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean, when somebody else is picking up the tab. 
you know
You know, there's lots out there. 
you know
And with this one campaign as our umbrella, my organization, DATA, and other groups, have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. 
 um
We just need your help in making it happen. 
 just 
But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas. 
you know
The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa, Asia, even America, that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami, are uniting as one, acting as one. 
 just 
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away. 
 just 
So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now, and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people I've interviewed. 
well
You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank, greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg, and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century." 
you know
You see, we also have the technology. 
you see
And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice. 
you know
You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans. 
you see
Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors. 
 just 
And that voice, without losing a beat, says, 'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.' Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking. 
you know
Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding -- I do that to steel my nerves -- and so I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my -- 'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see. 
well
Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs when I say that, but not on this train. Silence. 
well
So here I am with the couple, the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know. 
you know
So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby, holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof, I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam, what is your considered opinion of the human species?' And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly, starts laughing, starts busting out with this crazy little laugh. 
you know
I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.' "But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. 
you see
You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth. 
you know
You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain -- you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him. 
you know
I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous. 
i mean
You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling, but there's something in him. 
you see
And the official truth, the truth was, the law was, that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see. 
you see
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them, and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh -- that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm. 
 oh 
Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal; he's going to do a terrible thing.' Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim. 
 just 
And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh, I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?' "But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of, you see, all been buried; it's all been buried. 
 oh 
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. 
you see
Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not, but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says, 'We're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.' Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist." 
you know
You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this, I like to inspire people. 
well
And she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university. 
well
I mean we had all the materialistic things, but that didn't make my children pain any less; that didn't make their fears subside. 
i mean
"But the night that Myesha got killed -- and the intensity just grew and grew and grew, until one night we came home from getting drugs, and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her, and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt. 
 just 
I'm just talking about the particular night that she died. 
 just 
I just sat there and listened. 
 just 
He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours. 
 just 
All around her head was just swollen; her head was about two sizes of its own size. 
 just 
"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret. 
 just 
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway. 
 just 
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot. 
 just 
I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict, and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated, all of South Central, all the churches. And they say, 'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.' Well, what about victims' rights? 
well
Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them. 
 just 
 The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody, walking really in somebody else's shoes. 
 just 
And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations. 
you know
"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist. 
well
I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene, her family's always saying, you know, you ever think he's just a born loser? 
you know
It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know. 
you know
But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know, I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney, I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser. 
you know
 "And, I mean, funny things like this happen. 
i mean
It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says if you want to get lucky, you know, you've got to be around positive people. 
you know
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking; she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.' "And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet. 
 just 
I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours. 
well
You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know, like, you know, she wanted me to talk, I don't think she would even come out here.' "Confidence? Well, I think I ride more out of determination than confidence. 
well
I mean, confidence is like, you know, you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him. 
you know
I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way. 
i mean
But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form, get the horn.'  That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.' I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy, he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.' And try and determination is the same thing. 
you know
Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too. 
well
I mean, look how we are, the roughy family, palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me. 
i mean
It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas. 
you know
We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together and we sleep together. 
you know
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright. 
i mean
I mean, I have my ranch and everything, but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes. 
i mean
I mean, I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died. 
 just 
"Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a -- you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital. 
well
And then they had to straighten out my nose, and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head, and everybody said that it should have killed me, but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. 
i guess
 So, sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting. 
 just 
And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living: this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living." 
you know
So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second, had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep. 
 just 
And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in. 
 just 
It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools, but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. 
 just 
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk, that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died, and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. 
 just 
So, you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. 
 just 
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know, founding public-health interventions in the system of the city, one of which was called the "Nuisances Act," which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. 
you know
Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better, and -- oh right, we drink from the river. 
 oh 
It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood, this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool, that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act, bordered on an extremely popular water pump, local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho, that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. 
well
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. 
you know
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story, it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. 
well
We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that, you know, Rome did, and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years. 
you know
I'm just going to list some of them. 
 just 
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers. 
 just 
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. 
 just 
Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues. 
 just 
The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean, I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right? 
i mean
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here. 
well
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good. 
well
But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority. 
 just 
Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients. 
 just 
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. 
well
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again. 
well
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well. 
well
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right? 
you know
It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.  It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. 
 just 
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don't we spend that on doing good in the world? 
you know
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out? 
 just 
And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world. 
you know
At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do. 
to be honest
Let me just ask you, to start with, this simple question: who invented the mountain bike? 
 just 
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&amp;D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. 
well
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage, who, working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up with a bike out of thin air. 
well
And they were just made in a community of bikers, mainly in Northern California. 
 just 
The traditional view, still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity -- in organizations, in government -- is that creativity is about special people: wear baseball caps the wrong way round, come to conferences like this, in special places, elite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water, maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors, you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table. 
you know
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong. 
well
Well, one issue is that radical innovation, when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people, have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. 
well
And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. 
 just 
They take their leisure very seriously: they acquire skills; they invest time; they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet: cameras, design technology, leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth. 
 just 
Well, just imagine a world, for the moment, divided into two camps. 
well
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already -- between those two organizational forms. 
well
Let me just give you two examples. 
 just 
There'll be huge professional arguments as well. 
well
Usually they were reading the share prices, and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor, or something like that, and you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing! 
you know
But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists; they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice. 
 just 
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea, but can we really organize that, just on volunteers? 
 just 
Let me just give you one final example of what that means. 
 just 
 Let's just start with the word "vagina" -- vagina, vagina. 
 just 
And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina -- that it was dried-up and finished and dead -- and I was kind of shocked. So I said to a friend casually, "Well, what do you think about your vagina?" 
well
I thought that only idiots were happy, to be honest. 
to be honest
And the third principle of happiness, which I've realized recently: Eight years ago, this momentum and this energy, this "V-wave" started -- and I can only describe it as a "V-wave" because, to be honest, I really don't understand it completely; I feel at the service of it. 
to be honest
And she said, "Well, if you got me a jeep, I could get around a lot faster." 
well
She said, "Well, Eve, if you gave me some money, I could open a house and girls could run away, and they could be saved." 
well
Now, Mr. Alligator never did come, but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going, because I believed, in the distance, there would be someone coming to rescue me. 
 ok 
I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person, because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on. 
 just 
Now, this is a rear-projected drafting table. It's about 36 inches wide and it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see, like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards, can only register one point of contact at a time. 
you see
They can use both my hands; I can use chording actions; I can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to. 
 just 
You know, like that. 
you know
So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now, other than probably its newfound accessibility. 
you know
Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know, I could be doing this with as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user. 
you know
I can do that grossly with both of my hands, or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. 
 just 
Again, the interface just disappears here. 
 just 
Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. 
well
Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool, you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales, all at the same time. 
 just 
For instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk, and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time: We have all this great data, but for some reason, it's just sitting there. 
 just 
It really allows anybody to kind of go in -- and it just does what you'd expect, you know? 
you know
Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. 
 just 
NASA's really cool. These hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can -- it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well, let's go back to this. 
well
So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that -- It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion. 
 just 
This gesture is just putting two fingers down -- it's defining an axis of tilt -- and I can tilt up and down that way. 
 just 
We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. 
 just 
It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.  And so the last thing I want to show you is -- I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. 
 just 
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. 
 just 
But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, "What do you do?" 
you know
They're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me?"  But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. 
you know
And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? 
i mean
 Well, I was born... no. 
well
 When my son was four in England -- Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.  If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. 
to be honest
We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, "You OK with that?" And he said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?" 
 just 
They just switched. 
 just 
 Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. 
 just 
I mean, he was seven at some point. 
i mean
 Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now! 
you know
 Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. 
 just 
And I used to be one, so there.  And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. 
you know
They're just a form of life, another form of life. 
 just 
They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. 
you know
I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."  Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? 
you know
By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. 
by the way
My brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics -- and, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics. 
 just 
It's very unlikely -- in this special setting, and this collection of people -- but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't. 
 just 
 Well, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up. 
well
She told this to one of her colleagues, who said, "Well, what does your boyfriend do?" 
well
 Well, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said, "What does he model?" 
well
Well, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, "Genes." 
well
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world, and how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it. 
well
The champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate. 
 just 
If it's a tail -- well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away and put the champagne back. 
well
recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country, involving very large studies -- thousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases, common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, bipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics. 
well
 Well, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer. 
well
Well, amongst the 100 who do have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive. 
well
And just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent, to be convicted of murdering them. 
 just 
It might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of, and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we're not aware of. 
well
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this? 
 just 
Well, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life. 
well
It's very well documented that people get things wrong. 
well
To go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said. 
 just 
And everyone said, "Well, that's fine. He's an expert." 
well
Even if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one, that's not what it meant. 
 just 
And just to finish in the context of the legal system. 
 just 
It's all very well to say, "Let's do our best to present the evidence." 
well
In other spheres of life, if people argued -- well, except possibly for politics -- but in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically, we'd say that's not a good thing. 
well
And to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk, the apocalypse would be unfolding --  -- I might have said, "Is it okay if I talk about something else?" 
okay
 The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring -- I mean, there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift, so if grim inspiration --  -- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms, that is, I'm afraid, the most you can hope for. OK, today -- that's if I succeed. 
i mean
If you're just talking about social structure, OK, clearly that's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels. 
 just 
A lot of you have heard the term "memes." The evolution of technology, I pay a lot of attention to, so, you know, one of the first things you got was a little hand axe. 
you know
 Just absolutely delights the little ones. 
 just 
With the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires. 
you know
I want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds. 
you know
This is actually just a picture of the earth at night, and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty. 
 just 
The argument I make is basically that, well, non-zero-sum games have always been part of life. 
well
I mean, there are certainly plenty of them around. 
i mean
Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way, because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know, that's good. Well, there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat. 
well
It's just the Persians who aren't fully human and don't deserve to be treated very nicely. 
 just 
But this was progress -- you know, give them credit. And now today, we've seen more progress. I think -- I hope -- most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings, deserve to be treated decently, unless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion. 
you know
I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities, ethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me, you know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan, well, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car. 
well
Unfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know, or any other kind of business class really, but I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know, bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups, because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people; they're making money off all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least, 
you know
And you may wonder, OK, that's all fine, sounds great -- moral direction in history -- but what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all, I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework, OK. If you look at the relationship between the so-called Muslim world and Western world -- two terms I don't like, but can't really avoid; in such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else -- 
well
it is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean, if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West. 
i mean
That, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism. 
you know
So, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control, the international regulation of dangerous technologies. 
well
I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups, less bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever. 
you know
It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know, saying, why can't we all just get along? 
you know
It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah, I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need, you know. 
 oh 
So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests, which is further the moral evolution, then they could actually have a constructive effect. 
you know
I'm just doing what I can here. 
 just 
I mean, what do you do? 
i mean
I mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it. 
i mean
You don't want it to make sense, right?  You don't want to say, "Well, yeah, I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in." That's not a pleasant thing, but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know -- there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding 
well
  I mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter. 
i mean
But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists. 
you know
So I'm not really worried about it. So --  -- I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts, but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again, non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level. 
i mean
Now, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess, if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way. 
 just 
It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now. 
 just 
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. 
well
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things. 
 just 
A lot of people say, "I'm living." No, you're not living -- that's just existing. 
 just 
There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael, you'll like this one -- and she said, "What do you see in it?" 
you see
And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left. 
well
I'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine." 
you know
You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. 
 just 
And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. 
you know
And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. 
you know
And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? 
 just 
I just don't believe that. 
 just 
And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, "It's not about you," then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. 
well
It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it. 
 just 
And I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation? 
well
I said, "Oh, you don't?" I said, "Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?" 
 just 
Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. 
well
What we believe, obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior, and our behavior determines what we become in life. 
you know
We just said, we're not going to use it on us. 
 just 
You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. 
you know
It's just not true. 
 just 
I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. 
 just 
And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. 
 just 
And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. 
you know
And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth. 
by the way
They're just not in my pathway. 
 just 
You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. 
you know
And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake. 
you know
OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things. 
well
And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. 
by the way
You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread. 
you know
But he doesn't do miracles just to show off. 
 just 
Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this. 
well
And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED -- it is to say, "What's in your hand?" 
i guess
Did you know that God smiles when you be you? 
you know
And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower. 
 just 
And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. 
 just 
Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing, quote, "spiritual things," like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing or doing something like that. 
you know
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right -- they were just wrong in time. 
 just 
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later. 
 just 
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc. 
 just 
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi -- you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that. 
you know
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these. 
i mean
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold. 
you know
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. 
 just 
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. 
 just 
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago. 
 just 
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer. 
you know
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing. 
 just 
It's not just for the geeks any more. 
 just 
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world. 
you know
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive. 
 just 
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table. 
you know
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well. 
well
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute. 
 just 
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly, but then there was just so much fiber out there, you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell. 
 just 
The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt. 
 just 
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again -- "These days even instant gratification takes too long."  And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do? 
 just 
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at. 
i mean
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, "I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel. 
you know
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat." 
you know
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here, paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel. 
you know
But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this? 
you know
I just thought, and I thought long and hard. 
 just 
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we? 
well
And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset? 
i guess
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. 
 just 
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval. 
you know
But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit. 
 just 
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there. 
well
So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days. 
you know
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. 
you know
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand." 
i mean
Now, we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric, but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops, or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex. 
 just 
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they've launched an official Slow Sex movement. 
i mean
And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge 
 just 
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. 
 just 
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down. 
well
So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13, and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, "What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said, "No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day." 
you know
And just this last month, the exam results came in, and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent on average last year. 
 just 
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, and that's true, but that's not all of it. 
i mean
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. 
you know
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous with being stupid. 
you know
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as "bad slow." 
i guess
You know, I got stuck on the M25, which is a ring road around London, recently, and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you, that's really bad slow. 
you know
And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off. 
you know
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. 
 just 
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations. 
you know
Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, in their media, on the streets. 
 just 
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, "Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that." 
well
So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible? 
i guess
I still love speed. You know, I live in London, and I work as a journalist, and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. 
you know
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. 
 just 
And for me, I guess, the litmus test for whether this would work, and what it would mean, was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room. 
you know
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read. 
 just 
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, "You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me." 
you know
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work." 
you know
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know? 
you know
So, you know, sustainability, small planet. 
you know
You know, about a million years ago, a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees, got a little clever, harnessed fire, invented the printing press, made, you know, luggage with wheels on it. 
you know
And, you know, built the society that we now live in. 
you know
Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet, 10 planets, one planet. Right? 
you know
North Americans, such as myself, you know, we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs, and we're eating all sorts of stuff. 
you know
They may not want to be Americans, or Brits, or Germans, or South Africans, but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic, and more, you know, enjoyable. 
you know
You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable; on the other hand we have the unimaginable. 
you know
Well, Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. 
well
You know, what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools, models and ideas, which, if widely adopted, would change the game. 
you know
So I thought today I'd do something a little different, and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know, rather than giving you tried-and-true examples. 
you know
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right? 
 just 
You can start doing things like, you know, transit systems that actually work to transport people, in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. 
you know
Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much. 
well
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. 
you know
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car? 
you know
But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach. 
you know
We could just re-label things. 
 just 
How we build things can change as well. 
well
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. 
well
So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. 
 just 
So, you know, we have open source software, we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. 
you know
So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? 
you know
You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. 
you know
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. 
you know
These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. 
 just 
And who are waving their first books in the air, which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know? 
you know
And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities, not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, what have you, but here at home as well. 
well
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. 
 just 
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different, vague possibility out there, but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. 
 just 
And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough. 
you know
Now when you add all those things together, when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools, you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get? 
you know
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. 
well
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag, and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right? 
well
I mean, that's a great design. 
i mean
So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this. 
you know
This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout, which pumps water as kids play. You know? 
you know
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. 
well
Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know? 
you know
You know, that it's not just enough to survive. 
you know
Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells, I think that better things are on the way. 
well
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is. 
 just 
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino. 
you know
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags, but they can also lose press freedom, as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about. 
i guess
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment, where government really wants to make your life miserable. 
i guess
But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies -- you know, they threaten your advertisers. 
you know
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually, you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise. 
you know
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart. 
you know
The small one was, I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes, so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years. 
 just 
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. 
 just 
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time; you could not just Google in '91. 
you know
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work. 
you know
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised. 
well
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept. 
you see
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here; I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world. 
you see
You know, you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money. 
you know
But however you put it, you know, the numbers do not make any sense. 
you know
What is most important is we do it either in form of loans, equities, lease -- whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody. 
you know
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe, and moved to Russia. 
you see
It's actually just a drop in the sea. 
 just 
So from that perspective, what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify. 
 just 
Now ours is just one story. 
 just 
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. 
well
You know, instead of people running in this dark, trying to find their own match, who will be willing, who has the same goals. 
you know
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's, you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds. 
you know
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars. 
you know
It's kind of a well-kept secret. 
well
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire. 
well
And she came to us when she was just at puberty, about six or seven years of age. 
 just 
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer, is more upright, just as we are. 
 just 
He's learning the uses for a fire, just by watching what we do with fire. 
 just 
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water? 
you see
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other. 
 just 
Soon she began to write as well. 
well
And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises, which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think, well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds, to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. 
well
And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike, work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell. 
well
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. 
 just 
And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move? 
well
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements, you guys can film us collecting the data." 
well
And believe it or not, they went for it.  So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. 
 just 
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards -- just a spectacular movement. 
 just 
So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it? 
well
So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring. 
well
And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression. 
well
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists. 
well
So the next and final question was, well, how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails? 
well
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. 
 just 
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell. 
you know
So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab, and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big. 
well
And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating well over 200 pounds of force. 
well
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. 
 just 
Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. 
 just 
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show. 
 just 
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. 
 just 
So really, just an amazing image, slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. 
 just 
And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. 
well
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal? 
well
 So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, not as a spring but as a visual signal. 
well
And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more, they just signal. They wave their legs around. 
 just 
It's a well-established fact of these animals that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to. 
well
So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this. 
well
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. 
 just 
We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is, what gives happiness -- or happiness, which I equate with joy in my particular area, and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And 
 just 
you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, 
i mean
the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now. 
you see
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult. 
you know
We can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents. What do you see here? 
you see
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. 
you see
But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way, if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on experience. 
 just 
Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed, and actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do these things. Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did 
 um
when the Florida ballot was going around. You know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for Bush; count 'em again ... 
you know
You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine, but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for, you know, amusement parks and that kind of stuff. 
you know
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this? 
you see
Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up? It's completely static. 
you see
Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up, and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. 
you see
Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and 
okay
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. 
well
Now, another great designer -- he's very well known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just builds some fantastic things. This is simply amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle, you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. 
well
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells -- un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after all, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with the universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil cabinets. 
 just 
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've created, some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here, running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. 
you see
I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute. 
 just 
I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. 
i mean
I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street, and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago, right across the street from here. 
i mean
And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries, where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes -- Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries. 
you see
So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted, just like I wasted a day. 
 just 
If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted. 
you see
That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country. 
you see
And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house. 
 just 
I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. 
i mean
And anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started -- I first went to them and said, "You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient." 
you know
I created a company in America called Gonofone, which in Bengali means "people's phone." 
i mean
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places, because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country. 
i mean
It's just an experiment. 
 just 
And we're just beginning to understand this stuff. 
 just 
Because we're just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are. 
 just 
And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much, except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters, which is what makes you you, as far as gene code inside each of your cells, and this little amoeba which, you know, sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions, turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside. 
you know
We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo. 
 just 
So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey. 
 just 
I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't. 
i mean
And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on. 
 just 
 And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is, it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that, AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root. 
 just 
In the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it -- and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago; the first human was read two years ago; the first insect was read two years ago. 
by the way
In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know, you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine, or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials, which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn. 
you know
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings, and what the program is for those cells to differentiate, one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer, and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas. 
you know
Okay? 
okay
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but... 
you know
So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months and the power doubles, right? 
you know
Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits moving inside from the United States to the United States; about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries; about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff. 
well
Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it. 
well
Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but -- oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous. 
by the way
It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing in English and French and German, but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple. 
 just 
Well, watch what happens to India. 
well
India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.

you know
You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response. 
you know
I said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now. 
 just 
These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe. 
 just 
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed, and feel that you are one of the great hopes -- not just for American achievement in science and technology, but for the whole world. 
 just 
If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. 
 just 
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. 
 just 
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria, which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide. 
 just 
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil, just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there. 
 just 
 And that may be just the beginning! 
 just 
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them, have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms, one might -- just might -- find aliens among them. 
 just 
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. 
well
Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N., staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved. 
 um
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp. 
 just 
My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well. 
well
When war with Iraq was imminent, I realized the American troops would be very well covered, so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad. 
well
It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with, and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. 
well
We just reorganized the markets. 
 just 
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled, but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly. 
well
It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say, well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption -- I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, and feeds corruption. 
well
The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. 
you know
We have about 500 people around the world working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing -- just for transportation, room and board. 
 just 
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. 
i mean
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. 
 just 
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 -- but that's a story for another day. 
you know
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?" 
well
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes. 
well
And my dad said, "Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better. 
well
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it." 
well
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?" 
i mean
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas." 
 just 
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. 
 just 
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. 
i mean
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. 
 just 
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. 
well
It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. 
 just 
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man." 
 just 
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill -- there is no Santa Claus." 
by the way
 "So I told them that your birthday was September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th. 
 just 
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. 
 just 
This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. 
 just 
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. 
well
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people, if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. 
 just 
So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered. 
 just 
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often. 
well
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God." 
well
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you." 
well
 Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone. 
 just 
 Well, I was just on the edge of my seat. 
well
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S." 
well
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. 
well
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start --  telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord. 
i mean
And I said, "No, I don't," because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'? 
well
And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy." 
well
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children." 
well
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." 
i mean
 Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. 
well
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity." 
well
 And they said, "Oh.  Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state. 
well
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back. 
well
But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself. 
to be honest
 "And she had a baby, and that's the son of God," I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous. 
i mean
I'm just so used to that story. 
 just 
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, "Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. 
well
You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no, because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to. 
you know
So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions. 
i mean
 So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three. 
 just 
I mean -- no, I mean like in the TED sense? 
i mean
And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?" 
 just 
 And, finally, you know, become freelance. 
you know
I'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here, because it's a little too deep for all of you, but --  It's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's -- [DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING] It's unfortunate that I don't have more time. 
you know
Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures, you know? 
you know
And they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out, but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked." 
i mean
But you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure." [rocking out naked]  I hear a lot of you whispering. 
you know
I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past, I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. 
i guess
And I've got to say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here. 
you know
 I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.  Not just the good stuff, though. 
 just 
 Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell. 
well
I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things. So I decided to try my hand. 
i mean
I'm hoping it's going to do well this year. 
well
Making things, you know -- making things actually does give me a lot of joy. 
you know
It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life, and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do, but it's not finished, and you're not starting something -- that really fills my entire life. 
you know
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing, and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure, awful little thing that they created. 
you know
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it, or they draw penises and things like that. 
 just 
So the idea is that you can really, you know, partake in this process, but watch something really crappy look beautiful. 
you know
I mean this is incredible. An 11-year-old girl drew this and submitted it. 
i mean
It's just gorgeous. 
 just 
I became interested in puppets, and I just want to show one last thing to you. 
 just 
And I think the reason for that --  -- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's -- well, it's as Chris said, bonkers. 
well
We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time. 
 just 
And skiing along that first trip, I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going. 
 just 
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know -- ah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo. 
you know
 To make things worse, you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon. 
 just 
When the ice was flat or flattish, I could just about pull both. 
 just 
The weather is just appalling -- oh, drifted back about five miles Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice. 
 just 
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway -- based on a sort of survival suit -- I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear -- that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens, it would pull up around my face, and seal pretty tightly around my face. 
i suppose
Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone, Iridium satellite phone. 
well
You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. 
 just 
You can just see -- there's a nine and a string of zeros here. 
 just 
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. 
 just 
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position. 
 just 
It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times, and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. 
 just 
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice; we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said, "Just -- just get in the back." 
 just 
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. 
 just 
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway, banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls, and he just took one hand off, reached back, flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit, and it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall. 
 just 
I mean, it really was starting to break up. 
i mean
And on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential, just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of. So, on a wider scale, I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people with their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet. 
 just 
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is -- is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten -- but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old, and it's framed above my desk at home. It says, "Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile." 
i mean
So, what you see in the background is a prototype. 
you see
And that's what you see here. 
you see
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer; on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor, any of that stuff -- it's just this material. 
 just 
If you need more resource, you just apply more computer. 
 just 
So, now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides from an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules. 
well
Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here: from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal, you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device. 
well
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically, where you write a code, much like protein folding, that specifies their structure. 
 just 
So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology; the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that. 
 just 
So, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools, where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits. 
well
So I started teaching a class, modestly called, "How To Make Almost Anything." And that wasn't meant to be provocative; it was just for a few research students. 
 just 
You know, hundreds of people came in begging, all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it. 
you know
Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work, or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children, or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted? 
 just 
Well, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming. 
well
This is a device that lets you see your music. 
you see
You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization. 
 just 
Today, when you spend that much of your money, there's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means classes at a local school, a website -- stuff that's just not that exciting. 
 just 
A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify the world, not just get information about it on a screen. 
 just 
We didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places; we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment. 
 just 
You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it. 
 just 
This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center. 
 just 
So she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it, learning how to program it. She didn't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew she just had to do it. There was something electric about it. 
 just 
This is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time. 
you know
And, again, that was just for the joy of it. 
 just 
They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box -- which, as you see up there, that's becoming a business -- but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT, so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eight-year-old children because they had better designs. 
you see
In DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know; in the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of -- they all want to talk about it, but it breaks their organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them, in many cases, to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology. 
you know
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough, you can solve the problems. 
 just 
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks; they're sources. 
 just 
So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication, where the output of computation programs the physical world. 
 just 
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar. 
you see
They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. 
 just 
Here are just some pictures of the factory. 
 just 
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. 
 just 
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well. 
well
 This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. 
well
Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly. 
well
"Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family." 
well
Here we go. Can you see there? 
you see
Even between neighbors. Yemen, civil war. United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used. 
well
There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.  And this won't work. 
you know
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. 
well
And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: "Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree." 
well
And you might say, "Well, God designed the cow." 
well
And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better. 
 just 
Religions are natural phenomena -- they're just as natural as cows. 
 just 
They have a biological base, just like the aurochs. 
 just 
You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. 
 just 
Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it: Education on world religions for all of our children -- in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling. 
 just 
So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history, about their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements. 
 just 
Parents -- I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children. 
 just 
All I'm saying is -- and facts, facts only; no values, just facts -- about all the world's religions. 
 just 
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. 
well
It seems to me to be such a plausible, natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. 
 just 
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. 
 just 
That was just 10,000 years ago. 
 just 
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. 
 just 
Same idea. Well, not quite. 
well
You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. 
 just 
First of all, the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is -- it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded. 
 just 
 Just exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing. 
 just 
This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. 
 just 
I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man. 
 just 
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. 
 just 
Now, I just do not believe that. 
 just 
By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. 
by the way
But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion. 
 just 
How about this: "God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it." 
 just 
Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. 
well
So I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet." 
well
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet, after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years, discourages people from scientific understanding. 
 just 
Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. 
well
Well, the sense of which I agree with him, except I think it has an evolutionary explanation. 
well
Well, this is from "The Purpose Driven Life": "The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything." 
well
Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this? 
well
Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions, when their holy books are telling them, "Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!"? 
 just 
If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God. 
you know
And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. 
 just 
Once you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you? 
you know
Those people very often -- you know some of them -- end up the rest of their life with all this love, education, money and background going in and out of rehab. 
you know
And what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won. Audience: Yeah! 
 just 
Do you know what I'm talking about? 
you know
I know the Google geniuses I saw here -- I mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. 
i mean
She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. 
 just 
You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right? 
you see
Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth -- you don't form it -- then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. 
you know
You know what will happen, when and how it will happen, what would you feel? 
you know
It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius, but he's got a calling now. 
you see
And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything, just giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this: that strangers care. 
 just 
Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for in the English language, which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. 
 just 
They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed. 
 oh 
How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off? 
you know
How many of you know somebody like this? 
you know
Well, it turns out when brains triple in size, they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures. 
well
Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. 
 just 
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have. 
well
Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it. 
you see
He is not saying, "Well, there were some nice guys. They had a gym." 
well
And then finally -- you know, the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for the Beatles, until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. 
you know
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed -- yes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician -- he had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles." 
well
Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people, and it is the secret of happiness. 
okay
"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have that much in common with her, and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face." 
 just 
Well, it's very simple. 
well
What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it? 
 just 
"Really, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?" 
 just 
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue." 
 just 
Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. 
well
And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess. 
 just 
They're not just saying it because they own it, because they don't know they own it. 
 just 
Now, when psychologists show you bars, you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. 
you know
"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?" 
 just 
In one case, the students are told, "But you know, if you want to change your mind, I'll always have the other one here, and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters," -- yeah, "headquarters" -- "I'll be glad to swap it out with you. 
you know
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email. 
 just 
The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite: "Make your choice, and by the way, the mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England. 
by the way
Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking, satisfaction with the pictures. 
 just 
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course, and we can do it one of two ways. 
you know
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? That seems like a one-question IQ test. 
 just 
The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example. Science, as opposed to technology, does violence to common sense. 
 just 
Every time you drink a glass of water, he points out, the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell.  It's just elementary probability theory. 
well
And of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders -- you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree. 
well
And his friend replied, "Well, obviously, because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth." 
well
Wittgenstein replied, "Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?"  Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks, are really almost entirely composed of empty space. 
well
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality as a rock. 
 just 
The only difference, you see, is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. 
you see
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells, just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes. 
 just 
Now, there's another fatty acid, capric acid, which is just like the other two, except that it has two more carbon atoms. 
 just 
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable. 
 just 
But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time, and again and again. In this case, the hand would move, and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. 
 just 
We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at. 
 just 
Queerer than can in principle be supposed, or just queerer than we can suppose, given the limitations of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World? 
 just 
Could we, by training and practice, emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large? 
well
 The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland, we live in a social world. We swim through a sea of people -- a social version of Middle World. 
 just 
If the universe is queerer than we can suppose, is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa? 
 just 
Okay. 
okay

The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. 
 just 
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument." 
you know
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions. 
 just 
They're just strongly held opinions. 
 just 
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness. 
you know
Somehow, we have to explain how when you put together teams, armies, battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them -- the result is this. I mean, just look at it. 
 just 
How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all. 
 just 
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. 
 just 
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick? 
you know
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half." 
you see
This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. 
by the way
Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. 
 just 
Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. 
 just 
Even when you know that they're all going to change color, it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. 
you know
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades, the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. 
well
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. 
 just 
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. 
 just 
See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. 
 just 
I'll just give that to you one more time. 
 just 
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady? 
well
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. 
 just 
It's just making you expect the detail. 
 just 
How do you know that's what you did? 
you know
You just know that you have certain beliefs. 
 just 
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. 
well
How many of you see that sort of boundary, with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles? 
you see
Can you see it? 
you see
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen, those boundaries go away. 
you see
When I first started talking about the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw -- I'll go back to it, this one -- I said that there was no filling-in behind there. 
 just 
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true. 
 just 
Now, if you think you see some pale yellow -- I'll run this a few more times. 
you see
Look in the gray areas, and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick. 
you see
Let me just pause this for a second if I can. 
 just 
You see here the red roof and the gray roof, and in between them there will be a mask, which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second. 
you see
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. 
you see
Can you see that one? 
you see
Can you see it? 
you see
I love this one. I'll end with this one, just because it's such an obvious and important thing. 
 just 
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.  One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people. 
 just 
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. 
you know
And, you know, we open it up and I read the music. 
you know
And so therefore, because time is short, if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward. 
 just 
But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on. 
you know
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do. 
you know
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more. 
 just 
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. 
 just 
Not just translate them, but interpret them. 
 just 
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is, someone who is basically a percussion player ...  And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...  And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just --  -- thinking about. 
 just 
And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing tympani and percussion, and my teacher said, "Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening." 
well
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?" 
well
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?" 
well
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here." 
well
And I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on." 
well
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there. 
 just 
Because of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things. 
i mean
And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things. 
 just 
And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician." 
well
And I just couldn't quite accept that. 
 just 
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept." 
well
The interesting thing about this as well, though --  -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine. 
well
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound." 
i mean
Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- 
you know
Do you see what I mean? 
you see
So there's always, always that huge -- I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from. 
 just 
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work.  It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be ...  Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, 
well
how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well. 
well
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. 
i mean
I cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying, "Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they're deaf." 
well
We just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that's what deafness is about. 
 just 
And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. 
you know
And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician, is that it is so unbelievably fluid. 
you know
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder." 
 just 
Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. 
 just 
And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try. 
 just 
Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping.  Try again. 
well
You know, the interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. 
you know
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum, because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week." 
 just 
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to? 
well
I need to play a piece of music." "Oh, well, this will help your control!" 
well
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music. 
well
You know. I need to say something. 
you know
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that? 
 just 
So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber. 
 just 
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night. 
 just 
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. 
you know
Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck. 
well
So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world -- well, what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species? 
well
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate, because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed? 
 just 
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here," and we say, "That's not part of my plan," then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. 
well
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful, then you're just moving chess pieces around, if you don't know you're taking the king. 
 just 
Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, clean water, soil and power -- economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period. 
 just 
If we look at the world of architecture, we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin, the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?" 
well
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius. 
i guess
And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example -- you see that little blue thing above Hawaii? 
you see
Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it? 
well
 So, we're looking at the same criteria as most people -- you know, can I afford it? 
you know
You know, most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere, which means strive together. 
you know
We're also looking at survival of the fittest, not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground, but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good. 
 just 
So instead of just growing destruction, we want to grow the things that we might enjoy, and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese. 
 just 
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. 
 just 
These are community affairs, by the way. 
by the way
And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that, we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations. 
you know
I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. 
 just 
Because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush -- the entire American river region, within two years -- every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there. 
i mean
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. 
you know
Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down. 
well
By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. 
by the way
People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. 
i guess
 I don't know why. But I thought, you know, sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention; maybe it's time to give this one another shot. 
you know
All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance. 
 just 
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket. 
i mean
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it. 
you know
But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors, I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room. 
you know
I took this picture just two days ago. 
 just 
And, you know, we think it's getting better, but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself? 
you know
I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to -- you know it's the whole thing -- we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point. 
you know
Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. 
you know
 She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very, very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine, then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. 
you know
I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it. 
i mean
 Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood, say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know. 
you know
I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide." 
 just 
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it, "Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute." 
i guess
I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring. 
 just 
Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide, nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip the City Council of Monterey, California off to me, and they'll offer me a key to the city.

well
These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles, but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them, for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities, for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers. 
well
Then, on December 26th last year, just two months ago, that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. 
 just 
And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January, I found myself standing in front of my congregation -- intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people -- and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions. 
well
And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit, as well. 
well
If God is a bystander, observing but not involved, then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him. 
well
But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions, and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well, some of you. 
well
Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this: "The foolish man built his house upon the sand / And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash." 
you know
That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians, and we must acknowledge it. 
 just 
You probably heard some of them: the man who surfed the wave, the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school. 
 just 
Perhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out OK in the end. 
 ok 
Perhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything, the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign. 
 just 
An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things. 
well
Is God just another name for the universe, with no independent existence at all? 
 just 
There is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know: "Namaste," accompanied by a respectful bow, which, roughly translated means, "That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you." 
you know
In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life, there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. 
well
But in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, "I don't know," and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all. 
 just 
It's just creationism under another name, rechristened -- I choose the word advisedly --  for tactical, political reasons. 
 just 
There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science, and I try to do all I can to help them, but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists. 
well
The God theory is not just a bad theory. 
 just 
So, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby, I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do. 
 just 
You're just not. Why not? Because you're not." 
 just 
Democrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected. Both parties invoke "one nation under God." 
well
An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. 
 just 
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further. 
 just 
Well, so much for quantity. How about quality? 
well
Mensa, as you know, is an international organization for people with very high IQ. 
you know
Well, I haven't seen the original 42 studies, and I can't comment on that meta-analysis, but I would like to see more studies done along those lines. 
well
Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it." 
well
This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place. 
well
And there are other possibilities, like "naturalist," but that also has problems of confusion, because Darwin would have thought naturalist -- "Naturalist" means, of course, as opposed to "supernaturalist" -- and it is used sometimes -- Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of "naturalist," which he was, of course, and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with "nudism". 
i suppose
If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books, instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself. 
well
Well, here's how it changed me. 
well
I just want to say, over the last few years I've been -- had the opportunity to do this closing conference. 
 just 
But I just wanted to say -- and I mean this without irony -- I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States. 
 just 
 I just want to give you a quick overview. 
 just 
First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct, and I mean everything with great affection. 
i mean
 Just to review, this is my TEDTalk. 
 just 
 So I wanted to show you guys -- I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you -- as a completely natural user interface. 
 just 
 Now we had a Harvard professor here -- she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from Harvard. 
 just 
With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain. 
you know
You know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology. 
you know
 OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent. 
 ok 
Now the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation, and so he decided that he would support -- he would support Cameron's work. 
 just 
The U.N. -- you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent, but I think we have some more exciting things. 
you know
And the really wonderful thing about this is, when you're done, well -- you can eat it. 
well
And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the light. 
well
And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ. 
 just 
OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help. 
 just 
 TR: So, we've talked a lot about global warming, but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice -- good weather in the wintertime, and New York City. 
you know
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough. 
 just 
Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary? 
you see
It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit. 
 just 
 If we put up the ELMO for a moment -- if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know, I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK? 
you know
And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. 
 just 
You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution. 
you know
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture, and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass. 
you see
Well then, why is it doing this? 
well
Is it just a fluke? 
 just 
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. 
 just 
Well, does anything like that happen with human beings? 
well
Well, it may already have occurred to you that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah." 
well
Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains. 
well
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for. 
 just 
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking. 
well
It's "infectious repetitis," and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. 
well
And you have to have a bumper sticker, you know. You have to have a statement. 
you know
Most of us -- now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past -- now we actually do this. 
well
Well, how are we going to think about this? 
well
Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together? 
well
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it. 
well
Actually, I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas, but for their likely misuses. 
 just 
And it's just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another. 
 just 
We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out, because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said. 
 just 
So let me just point out: memes are like viruses. 
 just 
And you might think, "Well, how can that be? 
well
I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?" 
you know
I say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?" 
well
Not just the priests. Everybody. 
 just 
Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct.  But in fact that's not why they went extinct. 
well
Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes? 
well
And before I get started today, since many of you are wondering, I just wanted to get it out of the way. 
 just 
Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is? 
you know
Australia, because there just aren't very many people there. 
 just 
And this is something that we should really work on, which is Africa, which is just a few trickles, basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. 
 just 
And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year -- we from time to time will see a query rising up. 
well
Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. 
 just 
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing, is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. 
 just 
I mean, it could be somebody's health, it could be somebody's career, something important to them. 
i mean
So this is a query that we had -- I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. 
i guess
And so I guess the U.S. finally, finally started to like it, too. 
i guess
And I just wanted to play it for you. 
 just 
As a part of -- you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. 
you know
More animals, if they start doing searches as well. 
well
They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. 
 just 
Okay, not very many people know about it. 
okay
But it was a dream of his, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them. 
well
We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off. 
 just 
So this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service, and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. 
 just 
But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. 
 just 
And -- well, I'll leave you in suspense. 
well
And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time," and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do. 
you know
Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students, actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics -- as a hobby, basically. 
you know
And News, which I just mentioned, was started by a researcher. 
 just 
And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news. 
 just 
And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom, we made it a Googlette, which is basically a small project at Google. 
 just 
And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people working on it for a while, and then more and more people started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet, and more and more people started using it. 
you know
You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as News. 
you know
And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up. 
 just 
We would never do such a crazy thing, but -- in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them, that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. 
 just 
And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized. 
well
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new, or you might not know about. 
 just 
And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom, and you can do searches really easily. 
 just 
But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that -- you know, we try many, many different things in our company. 
well
We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. 
you know
And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. 
 just 
And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us -- you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room? 
you know
I just wanted to show quickly. 
 just 
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. 
you know
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun. 
well
So the idea is we can make advertising useful, not just annoying, right? 
 just 
And the nice thing about this, we have a self-serve program, and many thousands of websites have signed up, and this let's them really make money. And I -- you know, there's a number of people I met -- I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party, and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money. 
you know
I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month. 
 just 
And, you know, thank you. 
you know
Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google, and you expect an answer back, right? 
you know
And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. 
 just 
This is a blog from Iraq, and it's not really what I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example. 
 just 
So, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well, but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads, called "related searches." 
well
And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this, in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq -- and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea. 
you know
And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said, "You know, I'm sleeping a lot." 
you know
He was just kind of writing about his life. 
 just 
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? 
you know
And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know, sort of going from bad to worse, and we said the related search was, "Retards." 
you know
And then, you know, he got even more mad, and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on. 
you know
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore. 
you know
I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money. 
you know
The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information, and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine -- that we should provide very objective information. 
 just 
By the way, this doesn't help. 
by the way
You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum." 
you know
The public realm in America has two roles: it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life, and it is the physical manifestation of the common good. 
well
Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to, by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present. 
well
You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. 
you know
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. 
well
We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here.  You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. 
you know
People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. 
 just 
It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this, but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. 
 ok 
This is the back of Boston City Hall, the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston. 
you know
You know, that it's a despotic building; it wants us to feel like termites.  This is it on a smaller scale: the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York. 
you know
By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town, they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken,  and they shouted at me and said, "It was raining that day when you took that picture!" 
by the way
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.  You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player.  Audio jack, power supply -- and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right? 
you know
You know, we hire firms to design these things. 
you know
You know, eight hours before deadline, four architects trying to get this building in on time, right? 
you know
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and -- I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there?  Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting. 
you know
So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to -- you know -- do some reality testing, and in fact, he will not even go down there because  it's not interesting enough for his clients, you know, the burglars, the muggers. 
you know
It's not that complicated: buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge, so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building. 
you know
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs, you know, apartments, offices, and so on. 
you know
Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
 just 
You know, that's not good enough. 
you know
You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural. 
you know
Here you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed, R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet.  A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city, city life, and everything connected with it. 
you see
And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century, is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city, which is going to be life in the country for everybody. 
you see
And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know. 
well
But we know what's going on in these houses, you know. 
you know
You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out, that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. 
you know
So that, you know, the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance. 
you know
Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it. 
well
And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. 
by the way
Also, though we designed it a few years ago -- it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so -- this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. 
 just 
And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read. 
 just 
But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED, and that's that people like us -- I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time, but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design, human-centeredness in an approach to design. 
 just 
Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models -- you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings. 
you know
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship. 
 just 
He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one -- a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. 
well
And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use. 
 just 
You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in, the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store. 
you see
And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving, and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. 
 just 
So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better? 
well
 DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls, or something to be aggressive with to release tension. 
you know
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it, as well as wastewater. 
well
And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about seven or eight years, this project -- and [we're] just ready to start building them. 
 just 
And just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit -- the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya. 
 just 
So we're in the process of helping them design deep-well, low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season. 
well
We also were thinking about the experience of Richard, and so --  -- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. 
 just 
 Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers. 
well
You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty, and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here. 
you know
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out. 
well
Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park, and we study theoretical neuroscience, and we study how the neocortex works. 
you know
And before I tell you about that, I just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there I picked off the web the other day. 
 just 
I was looking for a picture of graffiti, little text input language, and I found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these, you know, the script writing things across the top of their blackboard, and they had added graffiti to it, and I'm sorry about that. 
you know
And he wrote a story basically saying, well, this is all well and good, but you know what, we don't know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work, so don't believe what anyone tells you. 
well
First, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there, and I said, well, I want to build intelligent machines, too, but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first. 
well
We're just going to program computers; that's all we need to do. 
 just 
And I said, no, you really ought to study brains. They said, oh, you know, you're wrong. And I said, no, you're wrong, and I didn't get in. 
you know
So I got in -- in the Ph.D. program in biophysics, and I was, all right, I'm studying brains now, and I said, well, I want to study theory. 
well
And they said, oh no, you can't study theory about brains. 
 oh 
And as a graduate student, you can't do that. So I said, oh my gosh. 
 oh 
So what I did is I went back in the computer industry and said, well, I'll have to work here for a while, do something. 
well
Well, it took longer than four years. It's been about 16 years. 
well
We're curious, and we just go out and get knowledge, you know? 
you know
Why do we study ants? Well, it's interesting. 
well
Rarely, you know: evolution did this and Copernicus did this, where we have a new understanding of who we are. 
you know
Another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies, or businesses, or whatever, that come out of it. And this is one, too, because when we understand how brains work, we're going to be able to build intelligent machines, and I think that's actually a good thing on the whole, and it's going to have tremendous benefits to society, just like a fundamental technology. 
 just 
Well, let's first take a look at what normal science looks like. 
well
And so the theorist guys say, well, I think this is what's going on, and the experimentalist says, no, you're wrong. 
well
And it goes back and forth, you know? 
you know
If you ask neuroscientists, why is this the state of affair, they'll first of all admit it. But if you ask them, they'll say, well, there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. 
well
Some people say, well, we don't still have enough data, we need to get more information, there's all these things we don't know. 
well
Well, I just told you there's so much data coming out your ears. 
well
This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. 
 just 
Another one is sometimes people say, well, brains are so complex, it'll take another 50 years. 
well
I'm not sure what you said, Chris, but something like, well, it's one of the most complicated things in the universe. That's not true. 
well
That's always been the case. And so all we can say, well, my neocortex, which is the part of the brain I'm interested in, has 30 billion cells. 
well
But, you know what? It's very, very regular. 
you know
Very Zen-like. Whoo.  it sounds good, but why? I mean, what's the point? 
i mean
It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver. 
 just 
So, you know, I don't think there's anything to that. 
you know
And finally, some people say, well, you know, I don't feel like a bunch of cells, you know. I'm conscious. 
well
I've got this experience, I'm in the world, you know. 
you know
I can't be just a bunch of cells. Well, you know, people used to believe there was a life force to be living, and we now know that's really not true at all. 
well
And there's really no evidence that says -- well, other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do. 
well
It just turns out it's really hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them, it's kind of easy to understand it. 
 just 
And now it's not that hard, you know, here's the apple, here's the orange, you know, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff. 
you know
Evolution's the same thing. We taught our kids, well, the Bible says, you know, God created all these species, cats are cats, dogs are dogs, people are people, plants are plants, they don't change. 
well
Noah put them on the Ark in that order, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, the fact is, if you believe in evolution, we all have a common ancestor, and we all have a common ancestry with the plant in the lobby. 
you know
All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth, you know? It's like, it doesn't make any sense. 
you know
They say, well, we have a thing in a box, and we have its inputs and its outputs. 
well
The AI people said, well, the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that's equivalent to a brain, and we'll feed it some inputs and we'll get it to do something, have some behavior. 
well
Because you're intelligent and you speak English, you know what word is at the end of this --  sentence. 
you know
Well I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we got hold of an old brain, and we're going to say it's like a non-mammal, like a reptile, so I'll say, an alligator; we have an alligator. 
well
It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you, you know. 
you know
And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. 
 just 
It allows you to, literally it feeds back the signals into your brain; they'll let you see what's going to happen next, will let you hear the word "sentence" before I said it. 
you see
This is the most important slide of my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little bit. 
well
In humans -- by the way, this is true for all mammals; it's true for other mammals -- and in humans, it got a lot worse. 
by the way
And as you go up to the door, you know, let's check them off one at time. 
you know
Door, door, door, you know, color, you know what I'm saying. 
you know
Now, when your eye moves from eye to eye, if there was something else there like, a nose, you'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be, and you'd go, oh shit, you know --  There's something wrong about this person. 
 oh 
It's not like you just look over there and say, what am I seeing now? 
 just 
A nose, that's okay. No, you have an expectation of what you're going to see. 
okay
We test it by prediction. What is the next word in this, you know? 
you know
They just knew like, hey, they were going to build calculators and traffic light controllers. But it's going to be big. 
 just 
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up. 
 just 
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish. 
 just 
Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name. 
you see
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part. 
 just 
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish. 
you know
 And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna. 
 just 
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story? 
you know
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. 
well
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs -- we're going to head to the high seas. 
you know
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce. 
you know
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so -- so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop. 
 just 
Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals. 
well
And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks. 
you know
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola. 
 just 
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites. 
 just 
But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. 
 just 
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. 
 just 
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day. 
you know
 And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean -- because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites. 
you know
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, "Okay, scratch me right there." 
i mean
Well, not the one we tagged! 
well
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording. 
 just 
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay. 
okay
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED. 
 just 
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator? 
 oh 
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan. 
you know
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive. 
you see
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature. 
 just 
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. 
you know
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge. 
well
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh. 
 just 
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping. 
 just 
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. 
 just 
So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. 
 just 
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. 
 just 
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita. 
 just 
Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. 
well
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. 
well
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in, because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil. 
 just 
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves. 
 just 
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here. 
you know
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected. 
you know
And I want to just make one point about this investment. 
 just 
You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers, and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine, we just get together the smartest people we know. 
you know
I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store? 
i mean
 It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? 
you know
Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here? 
you know
You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. 
you know
Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. 
well
It's necessary and, just as important, it's good for the California economy. 
 just 
You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill, so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32. 
you know
You know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"? 
you know
Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. 
well
And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it. 
you know
Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa. 
well
Well, I'll tell you -- a lot. 
well
I guess that's better living through bugs. 
i guess
And we're encouraging others to do it as well. 
well
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. 
you see
Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&amp;D? 
you know
When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following, "You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese." 
you know
Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet. 
well
So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. 
 just 
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet. 
i guess
It just becomes intolerable. 
 just 
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater, but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you, you'd freak out. 
you know
You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. 
you see
You know, we really learned everything in the '60s. 
you know
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago, they went and took everything away from the haves. 
well
You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth. 
you know
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity," was all I could think of. What is virtue? 
well
Because when you open up like that, then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery? 
 just 
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. 
you see
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself. 
well
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right? 
i mean
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years. 
you know
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing. 
i mean
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral -- you know, what's visible, what's not. 
you know
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. 
you know
And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull, things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk, I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. 
 just 
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. 
you know
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? 
you know
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. 
you see
Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that? 
well
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. 
 just 
Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? 
i mean
So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. 
you know
Also just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. 
you know
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer." 
well
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. 
 just 
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software -- I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs. 
 just 
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. 
you know
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. 
you know
So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know -- okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here, and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. 
you know
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. 
well
We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience. 
you know
So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam? 
you see
The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. 
 just 
Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. 
well
We made it all freely available on the Web, just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause. 
 just 
But then it changed, and it went on quite well. 
well
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist. 
you see
I cover my lifetime here, you know? 
you know
You see the importance of that? 
you see
This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden -- can you see that? And they are taking over Sweden, and they are now healthier than Sweden. 
you see
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know? 
you know
But they're very small, you know? 
you know
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide. 
well
And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know, many say now the problem is that the emerging economies, they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. 
you know
The Minister of the Environment of India said, "Well, you were the one who caused the problem." 
well
This is what poverty line is -- 80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs, the food for the day. 
 just 
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama, you see the family still sitting on the floor there. 
you see
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know. 
you know
You make a PowerPoint, you know? 
you know
All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare. 
 just 
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross. 
 just 
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing, but it's not a goal. 
well
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way, is artificially illuminated at great effort. 
by the way
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. 
 just 
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. 
well
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper, and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. 
you see
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. 
 just 
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX -- Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. 
i mean
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989, with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. 
well
And we can extend that now to just about everything. 
 just 
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. 
you know
The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. 
 just 
When we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in, there are words that we just don't want to hear. 
 just 
And this is just the same. 
 just 
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease, perhaps even before it was symptomatic? 
 just 
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers, we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment, which is amputation, if you can't heal it. 
 just 
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. 
well
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I'll let you know when you can look again. 
you know
The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident. 
 just 
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question. 
 just 
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference. 
 just 
And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is. 
 just 
You see the cells coming back out. 
you see
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass, for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic. 
well
The gun that you see there sprays cells. 
you see
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment, deliver other things as well at the same time, and therefore we will seed that lawn, as opposed to try the sodding approach. 
well
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center. 
 just 
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along. 
 just 
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago, to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients. 
 just 
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty, and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well. 
well
If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date, is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic. 
you know
Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms -- the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years. 
 just 
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity. 
you know
This is not just through malaria. 
 just 
And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people. 
you see
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic. 
you know
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps, and I think we all see a lot of gaps. 
you know
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something, some smaller community. 
you know
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles, each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours. 
you see
Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here, "I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips." 
 just 
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan. 
 just 
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing, and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed. 
i mean
They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that. 
 just 
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again. 
you know
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss, the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture. 
you know
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up, I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter. 
you know
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull. 
you know
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks. 
i mean
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along. 
you see
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels. 
 just 
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality. 
you know
So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford, Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words -- I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently. 
 just 
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those. 
 just 
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton. 
 just 
And it's not limited to just people or dates, but we can actually put in concepts also. 
 just 
You know, this is really an infinite thing. 
you know
The superstars of climate change in 2006: United States, Britain, China. You know, these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept. 
you know
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens, and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers. 
you see
The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management. 
 just 
Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants, and the rabbit just happens to be there. 
 just 
This is just a road. And it's not very big: it's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other. 
 just 
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen, and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five. 
 just 
That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing? 
 just 
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories: where an ant is foraging, when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back. 
 just 
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go, and by coming back -- just by making it back -- they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out. 
 just 
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area. 
well
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand, put it down, turn around, and go back in. 
you see
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse. 
you see
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest. 
 just 
The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs. 
 just 
And this is true of most ants -- that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating. 
you see
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up. 
 just 
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing. 
 just 
So, despite what it says in the Bible, about, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard," in fact, you could think of those ants as reserves. 
you know
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there. 
 just 
Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well. 
well
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do, there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest. 
you know
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there. 
 just 
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers, and they work really well. 
well
And so just to summarize the result, well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent. 
well
Whereas the young, small colonies -- the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable. 
 just 
And we've learned that, in this species -- and I suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants, is different as ants perform different tasks. 
well
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads, and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate. 
 just 
In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope. 
you see
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these. 
 just 
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip, are contacting the ants coming in. 
 just 
But it works pretty well. 
well
But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers, just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet. 
 just 
I'm just going to pop in at the start of the game. 
 just 
And you actually start this game in a drop of water, as a very, very small single-cell creature, and right off the bat you basically just have to live, survive, reproduce. 
 just 
And as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out, and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground, showing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow. 
you see
Now, in the evolution game here, the creature scale, basically you have to eat, survive, and then reproduce. You know, very Darwinian. 
you know
OK, well, we fight. 
well
You know, this is almost like designing something like Maya that an eight-year-old can use. 
you know
And how do we make these tools, these editors, something that are just as fun as the game itself? 
 just 
You know, what happens if you give somebody a toy planet, and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it, what could they discover? What might they learn on this? 
you know
Really, this is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas, you know? 
you know
So I can come in and I can do things, and just treat this planet as a lump of clay. 
 just 
We have very simple little weather systems you see here, very simple geology. For instance, I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers. 
you see
So at first what we're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet, but then over time -- I can speed it up just a little bit -- we'll actually see the heat impact of that as well. 
well
So we're not only simulating biological dynamics -- food webs and all that -- but also geologic, you know, on a very simple core scale. 
you know
Because it's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out, but when you can give them a toy, and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes, I think it's an entirely different kind of point of view, where we're actually mapping, using the game to re-map our intuition. 
 just 
You see, now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics. 
you see
OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me. 
well
But we also have stars and things as well. 
well
You might be a networking god, building alliances, which you can also do in the game, or just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can. 
 just 
But basically, the reason why I make toys like this is because I think if there's one difference I could possibly make in the world, that I would choose to make, it's that I would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking. 
 just 
If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand. 
you see
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone. 
 just 
Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find. 
 just 
Well, let's start with Faron Young -- who was born incidentally in 1932. 
well
That's like me telling you, "Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?" 
you know
Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for. 
well
 When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock, but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the Baby Jesus. 
 just 
Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you. 
 just 
Well, how could it have? 
well
I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch. 
i mean
Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair. 
 just 
AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here. 
 oh 
I mean I'm nervous enough as it is. 
i mean
Do you know that surgery? 
you know
You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. 
you know
Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months. 
well
And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them. 
you know
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet. 
 just 
And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that. 
you know
Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact, TED Global -- for putting this conference together. 
well
Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa? 
you know
You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here. 
you know
And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders, just 20 good leaders -- you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself. 
 just 
I asked them to name me just 20. 
 just 
You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit is the individual. 
you see
The American will say, "I am because I am, and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime." 
well
Now, it is not just this informal sector. 
 just 
Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area. 
i mean
So I'm not going to spend too much time -- just to show you, refresh your memories that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time there really is a platform to build on. 
 just 
You know, as you can see, from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion. 
you know
You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important? 
you know
In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic, but increasing dramatically. 
 just 
And to support this, I just recently -- one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria. 
 just 
But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this. 
 just 
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well. 
well
Well, I was in the middle of it. 
well
You don't care what it is!  You just want the person to be alive! 
 just 
You know, we have to use it well. 
well
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid? 
you know
They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this." 
you know
They are just discovering. 
 just 
They are just going alone!  And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know. 
 just 
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. 
you know
Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education -- no, you can also provide that as well. 
well
WK: Ah, no. I just -- CA: What happened? 
 just 
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four -- ah -- three blades, and mine has got four blades. 
 ah 
WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power. 
 just 
WK: Um -- CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one? 
 um
And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds, making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally. 
 just 
With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry. 
you see
But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability. 
 just 
But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist. 
 oh 
To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity, of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come. 
 just 
It's just a sign of things to come. 
 just 
Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent. 
 just 
The announcement just came out the last few weeks. 
 just 
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa. 
 just 
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago, and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a James Bond movie -- and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes, "Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!" 
 just 
I just want to say good afternoon, good evening. 
 just 
But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation. 
 just 
And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday, and I thought it was really great, and I was watching those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought, "Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?" 
you know
My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush." 
well
I guess there goes my green card. 
i guess
We don't go home at the end of the day and think, "Well, I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points." 
well
If you want to know about Africa, read our literature -- and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying, "I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America." 
 just 
You know, we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live, and I find that's not true. 
you know
Language is not -- I mean, things don't have any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value. 
i mean
So, you know, the thing is to remember that because otherwise, 10 years from now, we'll be back here trying to tell this story again. 
you know
Well, it's just a joke, anyway. 
well
And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife and Dick's wife are distraught. 
you know
But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know, Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years." 
you know
I mean, picture this -- really picture this. 
i mean
 But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege, and not just me -- millions of Nigerians grew up with books and libraries. 
 just 
And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities, it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation. 
 just 
You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell. 
you know
So when I speak of leadership, I'm not talking about just political leaders. 
 just 
We had just had a military coup, and soldiers were pervasive in our society. 
 just 
It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16. 
you know
Because of his uniform they speak to him differently, and they explain to him that they're just following orders. 
 just 
You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana. 
you know
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore, this transformation -- the ability to confront problems, complex problems, and to design solutions to those problems. 
 just 
And by the way, it's continued to. 
by the way
I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking, persistent, creative, empowered. 
i mean
I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it. 
 just 
Now, I was a little scared because when you see those three problems, they seem really hard to deal with. 
you see
But, for me, I asked the question, "Well, where are these leaders coming from? 
well
Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes. 
 just 
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart. 
 just 
Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it. 
 just 
You know, that passion for what they're doing. 
you know
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead, given away most everything that I owned, and arrived with all the essentials -- some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar -- because I was going to save the world, and I thought I would just start with the African continent. 
 just 
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well, so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda, and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986, to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there. 
well
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business, that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person, who essentially spent 600 dollars a month to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods, and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty. 
well
First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team, and we clearly aren't the A-Team here, so let's -- I did all this training. 
well
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket, and I sold all these little doughnuts to people, and I came back, and I was like, "You see?" 
you see
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --  -- it's a good point. 
you know
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea." 
well
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said, "Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen. 
well
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by, and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?" 
well
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --  -- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean. 
well
I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point, which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty. 
well
The next one, many of you know. 
you know
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs, in A to Z manufacturing company. 
well
And we said, "Well, there's another option. 
well
And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things. 
well
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success. 
well
It takes opening your arms, both, wide, and expecting very little love in return, but demanding accountability, and bringing the accountability to the table as well. 
well
And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so. 
 just 
♫ Sister, why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer? ♫ ♫ So who are they who says, no more love poems now? ♫ ♫ I want to sing a song of love ♫ ♫ for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant ♫ ♫ and still gave birth to a healthy child. ♫ ♫ Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile ♫ 
 oh 
♫ keep singing, keep singing, keep singing -- my song of love. ♫ ♫ Oh yeah. My song of -- a love song, my song of life. Sing. A love song, my song of life. Sing. ♫ ♫ Love song, my song of life. Sing. Love song, my song of life. Sing. ♫ ♫ Love song, my song of life. Sing. Love song, my song of life. ♫ ♫ Love song, my song of life. ♫ 
 oh 
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job. 
well
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know, who became rich by receiving charity? 
you know
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another? 
you know
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand, it appears that what I'm stating is true. 
well
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean? 
i mean
There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers, by the way, who never see the president, except on television. 
by the way
You know, in a dictionary?  Yeah, that's what I thought. 
you know
Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.   But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy." 
 just 
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle. 
you know
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms. 
 just 
Well, I blame the Queen. 
well
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny. 
well
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers! 
okay
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers. 
i mean
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all! 
you know
This is my favorite word, by the way. 
by the way
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this." 
well
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books. 
i mean
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary. 
you know
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me, "Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?" 
well
They're just the right tools for the job. 
 just 
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real. 
you know
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful. 
 just 
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses." 
 just 
Do you know what that says to me? 
you know
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science. 
i mean
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California. 
 just 
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know? 
you know
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies. 
you know
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language. 
well
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you. 
 just 
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language. 
 just 
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in. 
you see
The axis of a wheel stays on the same level, and this hip is staying on the same level as well. 
well
And the feet just step over the sand, and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in-between. 
 just 
There's a guy pushing there, behind, but it can also walk on the wind very well. 
well
You see, it's going the other way. 
you see
It says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and I'm here. 
well
We teach it to our children. We hear it on television and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session was, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong, that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are, that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time, and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. 
you know
'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words, kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins, then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them. 
you see
Well, let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale. 
well
What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics, because many municipalities recorded the cause of death. 
well
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better. 
 just 
Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows, but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think, have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." Not because, he argued, humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative, 
well
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about, that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology, by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth? 
 just 
that they're disemboweling? But clearly, as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think, that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person. 
 just 
CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much. 
well
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary, it will already be well out of date. 
well
A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there: "Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured." 
 just 
A handy thing to have, because language is infinite, and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard. 
 just 
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance, are not synonymous, that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them. 
you see
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object, the noun after the verb. 
well
You may just be loud or obnoxious, or some other way causing them to have the headache. 
 just 
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think, from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs. 
well
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well." 
well
And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects, space, time, causation and intention -- which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species, whose evolution you can well imagine, and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts 
well
Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature -- the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world, and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction, again, as reflected in language. 
well
And he says, "I was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo," which everyone, including the audience, interprets as a veiled bribe. 
 just 
Or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal, that would be rather awkward as well. 
well
In the workplace, for example, there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss, or refer to him or her If two friends have a reciprocal transaction, like selling a car, it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. 
well
Well, what does this have to do with language? 
well
Well, language, as a social interaction, has to satisfy two conditions. 
well
Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection, under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward. 
well
You look at it and you see it has four legs, the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree, it doesn't have any idea what it looks like, but it's going to try to find that out. 
you see
So that was what happened when we had a couple of -- that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK --  -- they don't like each other. So there's a different robot. 
 ok 
What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in? 
 just 
The cube can swivel, or flip on its side, and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup -- this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything, we just let them flip. We pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations. 
 just 
So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there. 
 just 
And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists, about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to, who was a neuroscientist, said, "You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up," and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem. 
you know
You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist, and put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated, just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous. 
 just 
And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government, through NIH and National Science -- NSF -- and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs. 
 just 
Ten years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer -- well, very few astronomers -- in the world who would've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system. 
well
All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live, in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way, and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years, and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe. 
by the way
Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know, suck up our oceans for the hydrogen? 
you know
National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know, almost all the money that's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government, one way or another. 
you know
And they get to prioritize, you know? 
you know
But what happens, as this occurs, is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years, and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun, that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry.   SP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue. 
well
One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is, is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago, much less data on things like the ozone layer. 
you know
You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes. 
you know
It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms. 
 just 
So far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this. 
well
You know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you, it's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish, cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code. 
you know
You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really, you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say, "You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy," and they're going to hoot you off the stage. 
you know
And now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said, "Well, I don't think black holes are out there," they'd hoot you off the stage. 
well
Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really -- has just gained unbelievably in recent years. 
 just 
In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles. 
 just 
So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening? 
well
We finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold. 
 just 
Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air. 
 just 
A nuclear explosion is just as hot, but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid, or vaporize it, would be more like it. 
 just 
This is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it. 
 just 
You don't just jump into an invitation. 
 just 
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way. 
 just 
When you get there, this is what you see, and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable. 
you see
And our ancestors lived in that game park, but were just the minorities. They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are. 
 just 
To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity, I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here, and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys. 
 just 
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring. 
well
It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam, and you see the face here covered by sandstone. 
you see
Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning, preparation and description, which was very long, as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide. 
 just 
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister. 
you see
And you see that in humans, because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called. 
you see
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism, which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females. 
you know
Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature. 
you see
You know, that is very exciting for us, because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively, and that evolution is in the making. 
you know
They don't preserve well, as you know. 
well
Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today. 
you know
That's because we Africans concentrate -- I am from Ethiopia, by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere, or from outside. 
by the way
And I think that's just a horrible thing. 
 just 
One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move, which is very well named, because people kept stealing the computers. 
well
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other. 
 just 
 But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know. 
you know
And invest: if you see good people doing good things, invest in them. Invest in their organizations, or in business. Invest in these folks. 
you see
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing, what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way? 
 just 
And we don't just want people to see our movies and say, that was fun, and forget about it. 
 just 
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood, that nobody knows nothing about anything. 
you know
 And for Participant, this is just the start. 
 just 
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour, which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --  -- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie. 
you know
 And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show, now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore. 
well
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night, and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep -- I was excited, with this phone call. 
you know
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets, and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories, and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded. 
 just 
Told him my idea, and you know, he is one of the bravest men in the world, as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment. 
you know
The opening one was, "What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?" 
you know
Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help -- and we just killed one. 
 just 
I mean, we were there for an hour, talking. 
i mean
And you know, Paul was talking, and he then turned to Constance and said, "You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here, because I know she has my back." 
you know
You know, I can answer questions about my movie, but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time. 
you know
Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding. 
you know
SP: It just looked like, you know, someone had thrown a quarter through a guy, and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds. 
you know
Everything was cauterized, and it was just like there was a void going through the body. 
 just 
They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here. 
 just 
And you know, you walk, and you hear the pieces of skin. 
you know
21:00 hours, and it's just our squad going through today's events in our heads, whether we want to or not. 
 just 
And the tone from the email was, you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously. 
you know
It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know. 
you know
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within 24 hours of that episode happening. 
you see
And you know, you earn someone's trust, especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship. 
you know
Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show -- you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have. 
you know
So, when you may hear soldiers complaining, that's what they're talking about, you know? 
you know
And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think -- you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world, and my concern is that we have to have these conversations. 
you know
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know, we think we know. 
you know
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know. 
 just 
I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me, what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film. 
you know
And at screenings, inevitably -- you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff -- usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions. 
you know
Or you know, these things. 
you know
A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close, a foot away from me. 
you know
And he looked at me, and I smiled, and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes. 
well
I hugged him, of course, and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK." 
you know
So when I talk about a disconnect, it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier, which there obviously are. You know, these days, it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front, and everybody seemed involved. 
you know
And often, I'll hear people say, who maybe know that I did this film, and they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers." 
you know
And I've started to ask them, "Well, that's nice. What are you doing? 
well
You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing, but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers. 
you know
I think, I challenge us to say -- to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know? 
you know
And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys to please, you know, reach out a hand. 
you know
Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?" 
you know
You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?" 
you know
So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much, but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently. 
you know
So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign. 
okay
I mean that simplicity sky. 
i mean
You know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity. 
you know
But looking way back, when I was a child -- you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. 
you see
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997, and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space, because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks, you're cooler for some reason. 
you see
 And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made, just to sort of understand what these things are. 
 just 
In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine? 
 just 
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know, "Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain," so I made this amber waves image. 
you know
My hair's clean -- it's okay. 
okay
It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte. 
 just 
You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging. 
you know
You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it. 
you know
And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place. 
 just 
Like everything you see, every time you wake up. 
you see
You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them, "Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger, but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die." 
you know
What's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up. 
you know
They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom, and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here. 
you know
And this is an amazing experience for me as well. 
well
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life. 
i mean
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance, in our vocabulary, you know, 30-odd years later: wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells. 
you know
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport, in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent, then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together. 
by the way
The city goes out in annular rings, consuming more and more green space, and more and more roads, and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead. 
 just 
If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles. 
 just 
If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology? 
 just 
And they were saying, you know, "The architects, Norman was always going on about designing for the future, and you know, it didn't seem to cost us any more. 
you know
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit, to transfer that information now, directly into the factory. 
 just 
So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen, and those points in space are communicated. 
 just 
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone, the things that you take for granted? 
you know
Well, obviously the building still happened. 
well
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here. 
i mean
And Stansted, the green alternative, which uses natural light, is a friendly place: you know where you are, you can relate to the outside. 
you know
And if you looked very closely, you'd see that people were drawing with pencils, and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles. 
you know
I mean, major transformation. 
i mean
But meanwhile, as you know, wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature, set in the context of that, interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory and very, very relevant to this place. 
you know
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean. 
i mean
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting, is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it. 
you see
If, for example, you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement, it's the same amount of space. 
you see
Comparing it with a typical building, what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking? And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project. 
 just 
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying. 
well
And our translation of that, using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline? 
 just 
And if you just go back to the previous image, and you look at this area of volatility and hostility, that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause, in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense. 
 just 
And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve, a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe, you know, the future was the most powerful, innovative sort of nation. 
you know
You know, who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels, with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on. 
you know
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable. 
you know
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things. 
i mean
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. 
you know
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it. 
i mean
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- 
 just 
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes. 
you know
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result. 
you know
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does. 
well
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think. 
you know
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there. 
 just 
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him. 
you know
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages. 
you know
You know, how on earth did they know all this? 
you know
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs." 
well
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English." 
well
India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities. 
you know
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet. 
you see
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. 
 just 
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups. 
you know
I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it? 
i mean
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning, but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told, don't do this, you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle. 
you know
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems. 
you know
I am known best for human-powered flight, but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I'm working in now. 
 just 
The weather modification subject was getting started, and as a graduate student, on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast, and so on. And everybody would talk to me, but all the professionals in the field hated each other, and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result, I got the absolutely unique background in that field, and started a company, which did more research in weather modification than anybody, and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into. 
 just 
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back, and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt, and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight, which had then been around for --  -- 17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds, which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars. 
 just 
So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --  -- and did not -- the way I approached it, first, thinking about ways to make the planes, was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding, and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way. 
 just 
But that began thinking about how birds went around, and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly, and then other planes, and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged, was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place, but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider, 
well
We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit, the power to fly would be decreased a little bit, and if you decrease the power required a little, the pilot can fly a much longer period of time. 
 just 
So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --  -- that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons, and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --  -- because the prizes are all over. 
well
But this last time, just coming round, right now, suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment, in the concentration of people, and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it. 
 just 
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago, we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution, and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground, with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production, will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down, and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation. 
well
And so, the year 2000, you see there. 
you see
So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years, on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable, wonderful and fragile. 
 just 
I have no idea of what comes next, so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future, as a little warning. 
 just 
  Well, that'll be all the slides. 
well
 PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet. 
 just 
PM: Okay, and let's have the next. 
okay
 TM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags, and one of the first things, the production version seemed to dive a little bit, and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit I'll give you a demonstration of how it works. 
 just 
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current. 
 just 
The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head, and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that. 
 just 
 And then also, like it said in the video, you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another. 
 just 
 Okay, this one will be a left turn. 
okay
 And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want, and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production, so you have real collector's items. 
 just 
 And this, we just wanted to show you -- if we can get the video running on this, yeah -- just an example of a little video surveillance. 
 just 
 This was flying around in the party last night, and --  -- you can see how it just can fly around, and you can spy on anybody you want. 
 just 
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions. 
 just 
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps. 
well
Well, it depends, really, on what your goals are. 
well
When Mahatma Gandhi was asked, "How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest, most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon, and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person. 
you know
For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual, it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself. 
 just 
It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands. 
well
It's just the beginning, unfortunately. 
 just 
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves. 
 just 
It's just beginning. 
 just 
But I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google, so many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming, but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable. 
 just 
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies. 
 just 
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus. 
 just 
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us. 
you see
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things. 
you see
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet, it means there's been a fracture, like a fault. 
you see
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is. 
 just 
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it. 
 just 
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude. 
okay
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon, it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England, just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat. 
 just 
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968. 
 ok 
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first, a picture that no human eye has ever seen before. 
well
And in this impossibly beautiful picture, you see the main rings backlit by the Sun, you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created, in fact, by the exhalations of Enceladus. 
you see
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting. 
well
So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records -- I guess it all started with a magazine called Student. 
you know
And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this? 
well
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage, since you asked the question. 
i suppose
RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company, you can really run any companies. 
i mean
I mean, companies are all about finding the right people, inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people. 
you know
And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on, you know, the status quo and trying to turn it upside down. 
you know
And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't, 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on. 
well
And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go. 
you know
CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing, because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy. 
well
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who, at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic, and his view was that you were trading, you know, the world's fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind. 
you know
RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. 
well
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually, for that as well. 
well
RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality, that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they -- CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit? 
well
As I say, we go in and shake up other industries, and I think, you know, we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market. 
you know
I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there? 
i mean
I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well? 
well
I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints, you know, you can deal with them. 
you know
So, it all worked out well. 
well
I mean, what are the numbers on this? 
i mean
I mean, how big is the group overall? 
i mean
No, I mean, I think -- CA: But is that your hair? 
i mean
CA: I mean, it is a tough job. 
i mean
 When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here, it's very strange. 
well
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but -- CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about -- RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola, and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy" and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson. 
you know
CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice. 
 just 
RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols' "God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us. 
well
CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward. 
well
CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ... 
 just 
RB: No. I suppose if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something, that might be worth using it. 
i suppose
CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson. 
you know
RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing. 
well
And basically, he's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye, so when you're in space, you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you. 
 just 
RB: Yeah? No, he is a -- CA: Well, some people found it wonderful, some people found it completely bizarre. 
well
I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past. 
i mean
Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so -- and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale. 
well
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was, each one, actually, I think we came close. 
well
And, I mean, first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before, so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream, and we weren't quite sure, when a balloon actually got into the jet stream, whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there. 
i mean
And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic, as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour, the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour, and it just took off. 
 just 
And we were just crossing every finger, praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did. 
 just 
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time, and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped, and left me holding on for dear life. 
you know
 CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ... 
 just 
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone, the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ... 
 just 
RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left, and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped, I would only have a couple of minutes of life left. 
well
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision. 
 just 
And then finally, just thought, there's a better way. 
 just 
I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me, it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it? 
you know
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that: just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which -- just in case anything had happened. 
 just 
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing. 
you know
RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner, the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats, and crashing into the seas. 
well
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying, you know, come on, Richard, there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic. 
you know
RB: Well, I won't contradict that. 
well
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school? 
 just 
I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know, I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe, but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross. 
you know
And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news. 
well
CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross? 
 just 
 RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --  -- I've got it right. 
well
  CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being, you know, doing pretty miserably academically, but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams. 
well
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader, but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ... 
 just 
CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life. 
 just 
I mean, there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home." 
i mean
RB: She was, you know, she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age. 
you know
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids, and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up. 
i mean
RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids, you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm. 
 just 
Your headmaster said to you -- I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school -- he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison, and I'm not sure which. 
i mean
 RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first. 
well
A lot of people would say there's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back, you know, doing some ugly things. 
you know
And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well, and I like to think that's how we run Virgin. 
well
I mean, do you think about life balance? 
i mean
RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important, so from the time the kids were very young, you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them. 
you know
Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky, we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can -- so I can take them there and we can bring friends, and we can play together, but I can also keep in touch with what's going on. 
you know
You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked. 
you know
And I think it's important that the individuals, who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars, but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world. 
you know
RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues. 
well
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into, A, trying to come up with alternative fuels and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels, in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point. 
you know
And we just -- you know, there weren't really people working on that before, so we wanted people to try to -- all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that, and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth's atmosphere as well. 
well
RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called the war room, which is maybe the wrong word. 
i mean
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea, getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world. 
i mean
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say, we've got to fix this problem and we can do it, I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da -- here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that? 
you know
RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually -- we're working with the government on it. 
well
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think, of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him, it's a way of working with him, with his government. 
i mean
It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help, they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years. 
 just 
CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates, or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image, for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct. 
you know
CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment. 
i mean
I mean, it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases, you're still doing these incredible new plans. 
i mean
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101, so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go. 
you know
No, I just want to live life to its full. 
 just 
You know, if I can make a difference, I hope to be able to make a difference. 
you know
And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world. 
you know
CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business, I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of -- I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding. 
well
And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought, well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way. 
well
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks, and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things that keep you grounded. 
you know
 And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause. 
you know
And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know, sheer whatever, sheer ignorance. 
you know
Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co. 
well
And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything, because if you know too much, you're stymied. 
you know
And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth, was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas that -- fortunately, there were enough people there, and it was a team, it was a collective, it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas. 
 just 
And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co, and clearly we also needed to make some money, so we decided we would create a series of products. 
i mean
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house, because everybody's always, you know, leaving, they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail, and he runs to the other room. 
you know
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and -- from working for adults to children, and back and forth, because, you know, I can say that I'm immature, and in a way, that's true. 
you know
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand, I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference. 
i mean
So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --  -- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work. 
you know
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you, you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time. 
you know
So, I hopefully am writing, you know, books that are good for children and for adults. 
you know
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends. 
you know
This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said, "You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos. 
you know
I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning, you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me, because my life is too random and too confused, and I enjoy it that way. 
you know
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair. 
well
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it. 
you know
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true. 
well
And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know, we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here? 
you know
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know? 
you know
You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen and that's kind of the beauty part. 
you know
And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate, and what an intersection of like, you know, Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying, I'd like to do something to this book. 
you know
And I took the examples that they gave, and just did 56 paintings, basically. 
 just 
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in." 
well
And when you're dealing with grammar, which is, you know, incredibly dry, E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk -- and then you come to the rules and, you know, there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question? 
you know
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell, and "could" is an August Sander subject. 
well
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules, which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do, or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich. 
you know
So, once a month for the last year, I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty," which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is, but I know I can throw that around now. You know, it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know. 
you know
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing, because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?" 
well
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet." 
well
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart, because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed. 
you know
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away. 
you know
So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well. 
well
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina, this is the home that I grew up in, OK? 
you know
Well, not so awful. 
well
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead, just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow, but the caption says he is dead." 
 just 
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase, and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here. 
you know
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories, you know, are real sentences? 
you know
And so, you know, I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs. 
you know
Oh my God, you know what? 
you know
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the -- you know, could we have it for a second? 
you know
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because, you know, we're from Russia. 
you know
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out. 
you know
There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power, that spells exist, and that if we could only pronounce the right words, then -- whoosh! -- you know, an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits, right? So this is a very attractive idea, because we're very lazy, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, or the world's greatest computer programmer. 
you know
How many of you know what I'm talking about? 
you know
We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle, it's something we understand really well -- so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers. 
well
The neat thing is if you change the sequence and change the spell, just change the sequence of the staples, you can make a molecule that looks like this. 
 just 
And, you know, he likes to hang out with his buddies. 
you know
Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain, the functions and structure of the human brain. 
well
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails. 
 just 
I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells, little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other, and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness. 
i mean
Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain. 
well
If you look at the first slide there, that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK -- the lobes that constitute the brain. 
 ok 
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks, and you know it's a mirror, but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. 
you know
OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus. 
well
Now, the most common interpretation of this, which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks, is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women, by the way, but I'll just talk about guys. 
 just 
There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision, and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces. 
 just 
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen, and measure your galvanic skin response, and show pictures on the screen, I can measure how you sweat when you see an object, like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat. 
 um
By the way, if this patient then goes, and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?" 
by the way
You look just like my mother." OK? 
 just 
Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom, but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right? 
well
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality. 
well
He said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful." 
you know
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!" 
 oh 
 But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. 
you see
So, I said, "Look, Derek" -- well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two. 
well
 He said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years? 
you know
And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God, I mean I've changed this guy's body image, what about human subjects, ethics and all of that? 
i mean
 "So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead, so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?" 
you know
Well, there are many theories. 
well
One theory is they're just crazy. 
 just 
 OK. Now, the third theory is that -- well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right? 
well
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color, and that's why you get synesthesia. 
you see
Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common, the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking, linking seemingly unrelated ideas, such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun." 
well
Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun, does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire? 
well
Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet, A is A, B is B, C is C. 
 just 
Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion, but these photons in your eye are doing this shape, and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern, but the brain is able to extract the common denominator. 
 just 
The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold. 
well
You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, far from these beautiful mountains, where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different, which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product. 
you know
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few, but a fundamental human right for all. 
 just 
Well, one way to express choice is through the market. 
well
Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately, the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness. 
well
He comes to the market when prices are lowest, with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest, because he has no choice. 
 just 
Well, we don't need, now, any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else. 
well
Well, what happened over the last 25 years? 
well
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa. 
 just 
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands. 
well
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market. 
 just 
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else. 
 just 
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done. 
well
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade. 
you see
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework. 
well
And we feel that over the next five years, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market, and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles. 
 just 
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. 
well
Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas, that the Causbys must lose. 
well
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent, until the broadcasters finally got together and said, okay, enough of this. 
okay
Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked. 
well
Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument. 
okay
By which I don't mean amateurish culture, I mean culture where people produce for the love of what they're doing and not for the money. 
i mean
I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. 
i mean
The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other, a fact we should have learned many, many times over, and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. 
 just 
I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us. 
 just 
You had to go to the library, see if you could get them to find the books for you, you know, footnotes and all that. 
you know
Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up. 
 just 
♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here on my screen. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫ ♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers, ♫ ♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫ ♫ Uh-huh ... ♫ ♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫ 
 oh 
♫ Annihilation moves. ♫ ♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫ ♫ The sound of the final boom ♫ ♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫ ♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫ ♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫ ♫ You see what you want to see. ♫ ♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫ ♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫ ♫ the power of creation. ♫ 
you see
But it has to be technological, so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.  You know, ever since man had any notion that some of his other people, his colleagues, could be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia, he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body. 
you know
So, the way of treating these diseases in early times was to, in some way or other, exorcise those evil spirits, and this is still going on, as you know. 
you know
Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin, and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite. 
well
And they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall. 
well
They thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second. 
well
Well, I have the following from a firsthand observer, who told me this about 35 years ago, when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine. 
well
Well, they were happy as could be, because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation. 
well
And to their amazement, after it was over, he began speaking like he was perfectly well. 
well
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression. 
well
Well, you know, in the middle '60s, the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first. 
well
Well, you're in a university medical center, where everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues, so my referrals began to decrease. 
well
Well, you know what bovine stercus is? 
well
And finally, because I was well known in Connecticut, they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff. 
well
They put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world, who by that time had become so overwhelmed, not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy, but with obsessional thinking, obsessional thinking about coincidences. 
 just 
And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them, just got me dreadfully upset -- all kinds of ritualistic observances, just awful, awful stuff. 
 just 
Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals, and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head. 
well
Well, as in all hospitals, there was a resident assigned to my case. He was 27 years old, and he would meet with me two or three times a week. 
well
And he asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place. 
well
You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth. 
 just 
And you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy. 
you know
he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' And you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life." 
you know
Well, he said, "Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?" 
well
And you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him. 
you know
They just thought, "Well, we'll give a course of 10. 
well
Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember "Ruddigore," and they will remember Mad Margaret, and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd. 
well
Well, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say "Basingstoke." 
well
Well, you know, it's been a wonderful life. 
well
Well, those of you who know some of these books know that one is about death and dying, one is about the human body and the human spirit, one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds, and they have always to do with my own personal experiences. 
well
That I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened. 
 just 
I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor because my readers don't know what I have just told you. 
 just 
But more importantly, I think, is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under 30, and there are many, of course, who are well over 30. 
well
There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied, and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery, but it actually happens. And it happens a lot. 
 just 
And to put it really bluntly, you know, people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right? 
you know
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to. 
i mean
You don't need to ask permission from anyone, you can just go ahead and do it, right? 
 just 
So we forget, but we're also adaptable, and we adapt to situations around us pretty well. 
well
OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life, and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels, but most people have what we call a center of gravity. 
i mean
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing. 
 just 
This is just street-up innovation. 
 just 
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing. 
i mean
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff. 
you see
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well. 
well
OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions. 
 just 
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know, why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right? 
you know
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda. 
you see
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker, on the lowest rungs in the society. 
you know
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world. 
i mean
And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid, in a way that we just totally cannot conceive, when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world's population. 
 just 
So, I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find Coca-Cola tins on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey. 
i guess
 And so I just came, two days ago, from the Himalayas to your kind invitation. 
 just 
 I just wrote an essay on happiness, and there was a controversy. 
 just 
And first of all, you know, despite what the French intellectuals say, it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking, "May I suffer the whole day?" 
you know
 Which means that somehow, consciously or not, directly or indirectly, in the short or the long term, whatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream -- somehow, is related to a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness. 
well
Well, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life. 
well
I used to be a fan of Bach. I used to play it on the guitar, you know. 
you know
After some moments, you just go a little back, and then it starts burning. 
 just 
And happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being. 
well
And so, I think the best definition, according to the Buddhist view, is that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation. 
well
Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad? In a way, why not? 
well
It can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation. 
 just 
However, this is not enough. Those are just auxiliary, help conditions. 
 just 
So then, this just needs to have some experience. 
 just 
We have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being, what the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing. 
well
There are some which are adverse to this well-being. 
well
And if we look from the experiential point of view, there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive, to be aware. 
 just 
So, there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being. 
well
We think we could sit on the cloud, but if you go there, it's just mist. 
 just 
And, at the end, although it may rise, it will just cross the mind, like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track. 
 just 
because it took time for all those faults in our mind, the tendencies, to build up, so it will take time to unfold them as well. 
well
So, the interface with cognitive science, since we need to come to that, it was, I suppose, the subject of -- we have to deal in such a short time -- with brain plasticity. 
i suppose
If you see a comic movie, you go off to the left side. 
you see
Some meditators, without trying to stop it, but simply by being completely open, thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star, they are able not to move at all. 
 just 
It's more to say that mind training matters. That this is not just a luxury. 
 just 
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change, and here's yet another New York Times article, just like every other darn one you've seen. 
 just 
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something, we may be on the road to a solution. 
 just 
And that it's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back. 
 just 
Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago, which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far. 
 just 
So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties -- in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative, because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel.  No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started. 
 just 
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change -- and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change. 
to be honest
After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere. 
you see
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it. 
 just 
And so you see a net force away from the sun. 
you see
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right, I think it's almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in. 
 just 
This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not, give us more and more leverage to affect the planet, to control the planet, to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it, not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit, with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it. 
 just 
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment. 
 just 
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this. 
 just 
So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. 
 just 
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap. 
i guess
It's not a good idea, but it's just important.  I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big. 
 just 
You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real.  So because of this, we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions, and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase the amount of geo-engineering. 
 just 
So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes, but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations. 
 just 
And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know, we've seen the worst of it. 
you know
Not just at how you would do it better, but also what all the risks and downsides of it are. 
 just 
But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable, they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this, and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world than a non-geo-engineered world. 
well
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does, if you understand biology. 
 just 
What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take agriculture over a century, agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules, but the farmer would have understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when 
well
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff. 
 just 
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean, literally, it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption, and one of the best guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes 
i mean
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. 
well
Any place you see a differential, there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying exactly the same technology. 
you see
Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach, then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions, which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy. 
 just 
Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas, well, you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal. 
well
This is a well-known phenomenon.  You eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true, then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you 
well
We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades, you can get a really substantial increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your output. This is just the beginning stages of this stuff. 
 just 
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who did part of the sequencing of the human genome, who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like, a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are 
 just 
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such a modest guy that the day he won, his mother called him and said, "I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just won the Nobel?"  I mean, that was Mom, but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find him at the bench every single day, working on a pipette and building stuff. And one of the things 
you know
this guy just built are these things. 
 just 
What is this? This is the first transplant of naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell, insert it into a different cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff. 
 just 
And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff, both in economic terms and in energy terms. 
 just 
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14 bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the 
well
earthquake fault.  Just a thought. 
 just 
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future, one of the things you should ponder is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which, of course, requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become 
well
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion, let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it basically says for the next 20 years, the price of oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40 bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax 
well
Well, here's an example from my own experience. 
well
Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein, "You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity. 
you know
Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star, maybe in a another galaxy, there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are, and are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots. 
well
And suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on. 
you know
I think there are laws out there, and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well -- but we try. And we try to get closer and closer. 
well
But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes, we can still think there is one out there, and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it. 
 just 
So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law. 
 just 
So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents, and not just from the fundamental laws. 
 just 
Newton called it -- that's Newton, by the way -- that one. 
by the way
You look at gravity, you see a certain law. 
you see
You know what it means. A circle, for example, is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle. 
you know
Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space. 
well
Then Einstein, with his special theory of relativity, looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations, which are called special relativity. 
well
But you can just look at the form.  You can look at the form. 
 just 
You see above, at the top, a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z. 
you see
As you see this clip, look for principles, and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works. 
you see
Now how could it do that? Well, look more carefully. 
well
And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it. 
 just 
Not just with the traditional foot, but also the leg, and even of the body. 
 just 
You can see it here well on this debris. 
well
RF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did. 
you see
We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs, as you see here, and then we tested them. 
you see
This is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris. 
 just 
Well, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here. 
well
It couldn't do that before; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over. 
 just 
Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces. 
 just 
It's extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary. 
you see
RF: And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws. 
well
This is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here. 
you see
You see what happens? 
you see
It just extrudes. 
 just 
This is an undergraduate volunteer -- we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them -- that's actually just a red pen mark. 
 just 
I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research -- we just wondered how they climbed up something -- can lead to things that you could never imagine. 
 just 
It's just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research. 
 just 
So these are tuned toes -- there are six of them, and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint. 
 just 
Here you see it, next, going up the side of a building at Stanford.

I mean, I feel useless. 
i mean
And definitively, I don't know why I am here, but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor, you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!" 
you know
We can start, if you want, by understanding -- it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work. 
 just 
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known, I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats, and why not -- a toothbrush? 
i mean
Even, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean, and something of -- oh no, forget it. 
 oh 
We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know, "I am the man. The final man. 
you know
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin.  For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket." 
you know
If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go, "I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you, I can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that. 
 oh 
We have just to finish the story. 
 just 
And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK -- and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure. 
 ok 
Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape. 
 just 
Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals. 
you see
So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals, which is a great job if you can get it. 
 just 
 And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief, and my French is not very good; I said something like, "I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof." 
 just 
So it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever. 
 just 
Now, after I did the simulation, I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this, and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal. 
 just 
Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at. 
well
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields." 
well
And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this. 
 just 
Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us, and they're stacked recursively. 
 just 
Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture? 
 just 
Second, you might ask, "Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?" 
well
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity -- so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other -- you see very different uses for fractals. 
you see
And finally, well, isn't this just intuition? 
well
Well, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition. 
well
and they'd say, "Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid."  But sometimes, that's not the case. 
well
In Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape. 
you see
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game. 
you see
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things, this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him, "How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is." 
 just 
He said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw because they're very quick and they're very cheap. 
well
Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis. 
 just 
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast, and often the symbols are very well preserved, so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off, and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke, and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes. 
well
And I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher, and I'll come each day and pay you." 
well
And finally, out of desperation, I said, "Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877." 
well
And of course, I was only interested in the math, so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going, "You know, I didn't learn it this way." 
you know
It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer. 
 just 
And he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes, let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two." 
well
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers, but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno. 
you know
  So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this. 
 just 
And you can go to our website, the applets are all free; they just run in the browser. 
 just 
We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino. 
well
So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics, that it's not just about singing and dancing. 
 just 
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this; we're very excited about the future possibilities for that. 
 just 
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization, as we heard earlier, it's in the brain. 
 just 
 Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case? 
 just 
There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself. 
you know
I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out as they're called out to me. 
 just 
And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number. 
 just 
If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand. 
you know
1959, OK -- and the month? 
 ok 
Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. 
 just 
 I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there. 
 just 
OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. 
 just 
But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud. 
well
By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here. 
you know
If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, "you're close," or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself. 
 just 
add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. 
 oh 
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. And this woman says, "My brother is having trouble getting dates, so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating? 
you know
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called "The Human Moment," about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person. 
well
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use. 
 just 
And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.

Well, I've been thinking. For one thing, there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store. 
well
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people. 
 just 
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. 
 just 
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died." 
 just 
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, 
 just 
So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised, scraped and bloody.  You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.

But you know, they're young. They heal fast.

That's all bioluminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies. 
 just 
And you see, some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten, some they use to attract prey, but all of it, from an artistic point of view, is just positively amazing. 
you see
There's still 97 percent, and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises.

This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab, and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can, with their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings, look at light, look at patterns.

And I basically live my life in sort of a trance, and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.

And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you.

So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces, and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.

And I keep it going, and I just got,  also, this suggestion from Milan: it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted; it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic.

making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina, a Methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College. 
 just 
He was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew -- his parents weren't very religious anyhow -- but because he had been born with two club feet, a condition which, in those days, required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11. 
 anyhow 
The night watchman, seeing how things were going and waxing indignant, said, "Well, we're going to call the police, aren't we?"

Well, maybe he was too trusting, because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest.

There was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet, and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said, "Well, yeah. We’ve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep, there's only one place to eat, there's only one bathroom, there's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what?"

And just as clearly, it is saying, "It's okay. It was all so beautiful.

I delivered a lecture in which I described history as, on the whole, a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality, and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said, "You know, Doctor, human beings are fundamentally good."

They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece, but it was not a good one."  Well, it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on -- what else? 
well
I was still trying to take in the notion that these titans, these masters of the universe, in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies, when Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying, "You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book." 
 just 
And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair, but quickly gathered his wits, leaned forward and said, "Well, that is true, but I'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild." "Well, yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken. 
well
I've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words, and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.

And he said, "Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you." 
well
Well, I'm now a trustee of the university, and at my installation ceremony I said, "I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation. 
well
One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers. 
well
Well, we don't make any steel anymore, and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it. 
well
And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life. 
well
Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life. 
well
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech. 
you see
I said, "Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there." 
well
And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator -- who was tragically killed in a plane accident -- he had heard about my desire to build a new building, because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. 
well
Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood, the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm, you can bring them right back to life. 
well
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference. 
 just 
And I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?" 
well
She said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard." 
well
And I said, "Well, there's an easy solution to that problem." 
well
Well, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company called Steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America. 
well
We got it just done in time to show you, so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center. 
 just 
So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here. 
 just 
Well, we did win, and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden. 
well
And there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there. 
 just 
I said, "Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?" 
well
I said, "Well, where would you build this thing?" 
well
I said, "Any chance you know Willie Brown?" 
you know
 As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown, and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago, and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth. 
 as a matter of fact 
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board, and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase, and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech. 
well
And I said, "Well, thank you very much for that. 
well
He said, "Well, I built a company called eBay." 
well
I said, "Well, that's very nice. 
well
He said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network." 
well
I said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card." 
well
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now: the more pictures you see of these celebrities, the more you feel you know them, but you don't know them and you want to know them further. 
you know
Well, here is the image. 
well
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru? 
you know
Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market -- my previous book was only for the U.K. market -- that I suppose it could be called humorous. 
i suppose
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background with serious intent, and then suddenly my work is funny. 
i suppose
And really commenting, you know, based on the perception we have of the celebrities. 
you know
I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes, so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films. 
i mean
And sometimes asking the real celebrity, mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person, which is highly embarrassing. . 
 just 
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change, and there were a terrible thing that has happened, but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that. 
 just 
So, I'm just going to grab a chair here. 
 just 
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine." 
 just 
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times. 
 just 
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise. 
i mean
Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball, but I was, at that point, ready to move on. 
well
And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting. 
 just 
We talk about this a lot, and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example: Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president, was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?" 
 just 
 But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting. 
 just 
And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about: to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits; a little bit about everything that surrounds it. 
 just 
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines. 
 just 
And I'm getting fantastic help from the community; this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet. 
 just 
They may well be by a TED speaker, and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey. 
well
Already, just in the last few days, we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about, that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world, and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in, the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference. 
 just 
Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does, they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy? 
well
People adore the company. And it's better, you know? They like it. 
you know
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters. 
you know
You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel, and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility. 
you know
"I want to say one word to you, just one word." 
 just 
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable; you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina, you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate. 
 just 
So you know, when you stick this idea ...  where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across America. 
you know
I guess I just want you to think about that. 
 just 
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices -- I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks. 
i guess
We're transferring just a few little data bits when we're doing road controlling, road pricing. 
 just 
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free. 
 just 
So, I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan. 
 just 
Please, allow me just two minutes. 
 just 
And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes, it was the first week of May -- this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom; they're just white clouds above. 
 just 
I was here, planting my chunks, cutting up potatoes and planting it, and the bees were working on this tree; bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate. 
 just 
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are; that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me. 
well
Ugh. Mini-Me.  We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin, we figured out we are just one species among many; evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others; we are acted upon as well as acting; we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life. 
well
You suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature, human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world. 
 just 
But, you know, there's a comedian who said, "Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important? 
well
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. 
 just 
I'll give you two examples, also from the garden: lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites? 
you know
You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes and we came out with only 23,000. 
you know
Well, we're all equally sophisticated. 
well
We've been evolving just as long, just along different paths. 
 just 
the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants, growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement. 
well
It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance, but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it, and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens. 
 just 
They then move out to the next one, and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth. 
 just 
Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there. 
 just 
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?" 
you know
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ... 
well
This is well beyond organic agriculture, which is still a Cartesian system, more or less. 
well
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture. 
well
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible -- I need to. 
 just 
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives, we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas -- never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled. 
i mean
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning; maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome. 
 just 
But even though I just started this presentation, this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate. 
 just 
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on, so I decided to move towards packaging.  I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things. 
i mean
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is, but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla, and so on and so forth. If you were interested. 
you know
Unfortunately, just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius, and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression, as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it. 
 just 
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually, extraordinary blue sky. 
you see
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo, that little spiral structure you see there. 
you see
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street. 
 just 
Marcello, as it turns out, is the driver of the number 64 bus, and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter. 
you know
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner. 
you see
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip, but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering. 
 just 
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on. 
well
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No, I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale, so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space. 
 just 
Now that's one drawing, so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher.  You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope. 
you see
I mean, you always peel one layer off another; we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way. 
i mean
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers, vertical layers -- and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if I got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers. 
well
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue. 
you see
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon, and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square. 
 just 
No foldouts, no tricks -- just a book that isn't open the whole way. 
 just 
But it was the journey of the ...  I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome. 
i mean
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work and if the stories aren't going anywhere, I just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction. 
 just 
If you see the red line, you are seeing the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon. 
you see
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace, these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way. 
 just 
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower -- one of the few remaining medieval towers -- towards the church of Sant'Agnese and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona -- which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times; there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers -- and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo, stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus 
 just 
As we look at the drawing board, we see what he's working on is, in fact, a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken, and the red line extends through all the sights. 
 just 
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room. 
 just 
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma, so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly. 
 just 
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma. 
 just 
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions. 
well
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons. 
you know
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years. 
 just 
So she really struggled with this, what to do, because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together -- I believe it was 100, 150 students all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts, and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school. 
well
 Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous, but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex, it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly. 
you know
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared. 
 just 
Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century, we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time. 
you know
CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. 
you know
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future, or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women, it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself. 
 just 
 I'm sure you're trying to figure out, "Well, how does this thing work?" 
well
Well, what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand. 
well
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin. 
well
 I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing, or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements. 
 just 
And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon; I don't want to be like --  -- you know?" 
well
it's similar to being a vocalist, except instead of it coming out of your throat, you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference; you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly. 
 just 
You just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on, or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me. 
 just 
 And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy. 
well
And out of this idea started spinning off many, many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities, and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits, and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry. 
you see
And when there were complaints about budget, I said, "Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections." 
well
 In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which you see here the campus. 
you see
I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum, they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information, it would make them just unable to digest. 
 just 
Well, they said, "People won't understand, they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that." 
well
And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously. 
you know
And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense. 
 just 
And here you see the model: a reception building and some underground parking. 
you see
And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground, and you see the openings for the light. 
you see
And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain, which is a skylight on top of that triangle. 
 just 
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial; you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall, on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia. 
you see
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. 
 just 
You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall, very transparent and inviting and looking in. 
you see
And here studying, in three dimensions, how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure; not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process. 
 just 
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose. 
well
And I finished high school. And just walking, I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States. 
 just 
 and I'll have a lot more to show you, and if all doesn't go well, I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee. 
well
I mean, I thought it was a great idea, but I started building kayaks. 
i mean
Just so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove. 
you know
Two days later, the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space: "... trips to satellites of the outer planets. August 20, 1958." 
 just 
So you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion -- not like just a stick of dynamite, but you're directing it at the ship. 
 just 
Well, here we have a little problem, the radiation doses at the crew station: 700 rads per shot.  Fission yields during development: they were hoping to get clean bombs; they didn't. 
well
You know, it was going to be a nice, long trip. 
you know
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified, just that people managed to sneak home and after, you know, on their deathbed, basically, gave me that. 
you know
And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out, and everybody says, "Well, what are we going to do?" 
well
♫ Jill Sobule: At a conference in Monterey by the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫ ♫ I first saw you and I got so shy. ♫ ♫ You see, I was a little paranoid 'cause I might have been high. ♫ ♫ And I hadn't done that in ages and I won't do that again. ♫ ♫ But that's another story. ♫ ♫ Loved you forever and I've been a big fan, ♫ 
you see
♫ Sobule: My favorite poets took their own lives. ♫ ♫ Orson Welles peaked at twenty-five, below before our eyes. ♫ ♫ And he sold bad wine. ♫ ♫ Together: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? Yeah ♫ ♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫ ♫ Sobule: Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice. ♫ Sweeney: Oh. 
well
♫ Sobule: Hillary supported the war. ♫ ♫ Sweeney: Even Thomas Friedman supported the war. ♫  ♫ Sobule: Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together: ... such a pussy. ♫   ♫ Sobule: William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, ♫ ♫ Tennessee Williams, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah. 
well
♫ Sobule: Take it, Julia. ♫ Sweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine. 
okay
I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane visiting my mother. And to my mother, Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope, which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic. 
i mean
On a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" -- it has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill, it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts. 
 just 
And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law. 
 just 
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs? 
 just 
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down. 
you know
You actually just did that.  That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... 
 just 
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ... 
you know
BF: Oh yeah, it does.  BF: Oh, Daniel. 
 oh 
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons. 
you know
BF: I think we were just outside. 
 just 
 Could you just push that? 
 just 
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say? 
 just 
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much. 
 just 
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh. 
 oh 
 BF: Well, you know ... 
well
We see these magnificent star nurseries, where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise. 
 just 
I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education, are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative. 
 just 
And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing, but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe, who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place. 
 just 
Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?" 
 just 
Well, our gaze fills the universe. 
well
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic. 
 just 
SJ: I'll just be quiet. 
 just 
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on, but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing. 
 just 
She does this with cardboard, but since I have an expensive computer here I'll just rotate this little guy around and ... 
 just 
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure. 
well
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago, I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply. 
 just 
And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side, and I found that they matched up very well. 
well
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything, but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology, and that is: why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed? 
 just 
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician; she just had a feeling for math. 
 just 
Well, that's pretty amazing. 
well
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do. 
 just 
So I'd like to draw a little car here -- I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him. 
 just 
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again, I just drag these guys out and set them going. 
 just 
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here, and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel. 
 just 
You know how much trouble the children have with variables, but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion, they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it. 
you know
So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there, but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time, we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model. 
 just 
Galileo, by the way, did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute. 
by the way
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes: Marshall McLuhan said, "Children are the messages that we send to the future," but in fact, if you think of it, children are the future we send to the future. 
i guess
And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. 
 just 
And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start my normal routine." 
 just 
And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse. 
 just 
There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. 
 just 
And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tell. 
 just 
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender. 
 just 
Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. 
 just 
Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle. 
 just 
Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies -- new media falling very much into that mold. 
 just 
Well, it doesn't have to be terrible. 
well
Well, what's happened? How did people get into this mess? 
well
Where you are now, all of a sudden, sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems, and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen? 
you see
And they can be treated very easily; there are actually ways of getting rid of them, there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures. 
 just 
In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy. 
 just 
And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution, it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing. 
you see
Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up, and people don't realize how important that is -- not having to pick up your fingers to use them.  When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh -- and I will not criticize the mouse too much -- when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something -- first of all, you've got to find the mouse. 
well
That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion -- or one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count. 
 just 
Again, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that I think face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems from the perspective of the quality of that interface. 
 just 
But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays: we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points -- and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass -- if glass was the substrate, which it usually is. 
you know
And when you touch it, you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen, and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly and it just scoots across the screen. 
 just 
Filmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making: you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end, and in some sense the art of it is that. 
well
So it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame. 
 just 
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question, the last thing you do is repeat what you just said. 
 just 
You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing, or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style, then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student. 
you know
Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see, I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read. 
 just 
The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words, so I can get a different definition by just touching the word, and the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration. 
 just 
I can get a definition of these words just by touching them, and the definition will appear in the illustration corner. 
 just 
Here's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case -- NN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies -- this is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted. 
okay
And there are just a few slides I want to go through, but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when, before we did this in any developing countries -- we're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now: Pakistan, Colombia and Senegal -- we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City. 
 just 
And the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain and so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked. 
 just 
That child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic." 
 just 
And then they said, "But wait a minute. You just looked through that manual and you found ... " and he said, "Oh, but that's not reading." 
 just 
He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read. 
well
And it's not, but we think speech -- "My God, little children pick it up somehow, and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job, and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well. 
well
Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder. 
well
You're going to like reading," and just read and read. 
 just 
Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom: 120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher, a little bit of chalk. 
well
But rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest. 
 just 
So we said, "Well, these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same, so that at my site, I would be, if you will, real and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads. 
well
And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on, but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person. 
well
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. 
 just 
I just show it because I want you to know I'm concerned about context. 
 just 
And after we failed, I just kept failing. 
 just 
And I put a piece of tape around it, as you see there, and realized you could sit on it, and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on. 
you see
 I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man, and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning. 
well
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental, again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it, and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal. 
 just 
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one. 
i guess
And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way. 
well
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know, leaving out the -- what the hell. 
you know
And it was all of one material, and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls. 
well
And it's working very well to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it. 
well
I just tell the stories. 
 just 
And it's just a complex of factory buildings. 
 just 
I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say, but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come and where the people working would interact. 
i mean
I just joined the points. 
 just 
He didn't recommend me, by the way. 
by the way
And she came back, I guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site. 
i guess
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom, which I designed like a kind of a barge, looking like a boat. 
you see
When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope -- I mean, I haven't slept in it yet. 
i mean
These aren't focused very well. 
well
These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy, then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing, but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building." 
well
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here. 
 just 
And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood. 
you see
It's plaster and just zinc. 
 just 
If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything, and just wait. 
 just 
And from the building in the back, you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills. 
you see
Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space. 
 just 
 The original building, because it was frog-like, fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well. 
well
I just stuck it on there. 
 just 
 And finally, I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger. 
 just 
People wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on. 
you know
So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life. 
 just 
Well, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime. 
well
Well, then we moved to London for high school. 
well
Well, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border, in brutal conditions. 
well
Well --  -- I hadn't thought of that one. 
well
And you know what it was? Shakespeare." And he recited some to me. 
you know
And these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa -- inventive kids, intellectual kids -- and starved of opportunity. 
 just 
Well, after --  -- that's the truth. 
well
Well, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa before returning to England -- so gray and depressing, in comparison. 
well
Well, I'm not going to explain this equation, but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject. 
well
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang, and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe. 
 just 
Well, this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories, the unified theories, which try to explain all those 18 free parameters in a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them. 
well
And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here. 
 just 
It's all I can convey. According to these theories, there are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with, but at every point in the room there are more dimensions. 
 just 
Well, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question. 
well
Well, making and testing models of the universe is, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe. 
well
So here's just the standard area map of the world. 
 just 
By the way, Africa is very large. 
by the way
It just doesn't exist scientifically. 
 just 
Well, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994 was literally a dream come true for many of us. 
well
Well, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts. 
well
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together with the best lecturers in the world -- who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa -- and put them together and just let the sparks fly. 
 just 
Well, the new South Africa is a very exciting country. 
well
Well, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment, and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning. 
well
They'll do well. They'll have successful careers. 
well
And AIMS has done extremely well. 
well
 We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal. 
well
And I'll just show you one. 
 just 
You know, from physics to medicine, in particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling. 
you know
Neil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well. 
well
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital. 
well
Well, we had a party. This is Africa -- we have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me. 
well
But she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well. 
well
Well, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered. 
well
Well, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple. 
well
So, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans. 
 just 
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous -- and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized.  So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things. 
 just 
And so they would talk to me about this and say, "You know, what we really need is just more people, more bodies, more one-on-one attention, more hours, more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one." 
you know
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?" 
well
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each. 
well
And so they had, you know, their time and their interest, but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together. 
you know
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway, why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school, get extra help on their written homework, so you have basically no border between these two communities?" 
 just 
And everything was great except the landlord said, "Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something. 
well
You can't just have a tutoring center." 
 just 
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors, whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place, somebody said, "You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship." 
you know
And we looked around and somebody else said, "Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer."  And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh, and we said, "There's a point to that. 
well
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin. 
you see
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see, we made it look sort of pirate supply-like. 
you see
Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy. 
you see
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display, which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night -- special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever. 
you see
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads. 
 just 
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater, which is just a saltwater tank with three seats, and then right behind it we set up this space, which was the tutoring center. 
 just 
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free." 
 just 
And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap, because we were operating behind a pirate supply store.  We never put it together, you know? 
you know
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different. 
 just 
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem, especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up, was that there was just the one bathroom.  With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem. 
 just 
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention -- they go home, they're finished. They don't stall. 
you know
So the key to it all is homework!   There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention. 
you know
Then we said, "Well, what are we going to do with the space during the day, because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?" 
well
You just point a camera at a class, and it always looks like this. 
 just 
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events. 
 just 
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you, necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in, or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying, "Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster. 
well
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say, "I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays. 
 just 
Then another school said, "Well, what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?" 
well
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well. 
well
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store, actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money. 
 just 
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing -- I don't know, I don't want to judge. 
 just 
This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping, and they might be more likely to buy some lard, or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook, or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell. 
you know
So the store actually did really well. 
well
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public. 
you know
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, "Well, why don't we have a place like that here?" 
well
And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators, so they combined with a lot of local designers, local writers, and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing. 
 just 
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered, you know, all over there. 
you know
There's nothing worse than, you know, getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that. 
you know
But this is -- I just want to emphasize -- locally funded, locally built. 
 just 
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great," or whatever. That was it. You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back.   So this is the space during tutoring hours. 
 just 
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space, at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day. 
 just 
So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be. 
you see
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay? 
okay
All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish: I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual and organization you know -- will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved, so that within a year we have a thousand examples -- a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships. 
you know
This site will document every story, every project that comes out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website, you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started. 
you see
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are: how smart and how much they have to say. 
 just 
Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world. 
well
This went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular. 
well
But in that city, that tortured city, where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together, you also become aware of the profound connection between them. 
you see
And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion, I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible. 
 just 
I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures, because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice. 
 just 
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States, people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown -- but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism, which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned. 
 just 
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change. 
you see
I'd -- there's one story I'd just like to mention. 
 just 
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy. 
you know
And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar. 
 just 
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. 
well
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters. 
you see
There are about 120, you see them here. 
you see
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters. 
well
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin. 
well
And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case. 
you see
Well, we need a reference. 
well
And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again. 
you see
Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave. 
 just 
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there. 
you see
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that. 
well
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place. 
you see
 It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987, when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. 
 just 
A third time, it's just being a technician. 
 just 
And I'd love to talk about this, but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn't need much talking about -- but I guess I may be very wrong about that, and everything else that I've said. 
i guess
It probably has lies in it as well. 
well
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher, ask an experienced one. 
 just 
Just two weeks ago I made -- you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade. 
you know
But what I've just made -- and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here. 
 just 
And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me, standing -- well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials. 
well
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god, that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio! 
 oh 
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah! 
 oh 
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there -- I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71. 
 just 
 And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do -- I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave, almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope. 
 just 
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay? 
okay
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say, "Well, how come you ain't teaching?" 
well
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate -- I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes." 
well
Not just showing up every now and then. 
 just 
Not just show up to class every now and then. 
 just 
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough. 
okay
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light? 
you know
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man," I was just going to impose upon the powers that be, and measure the speed of light. 
 just 
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo. 
well
And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ... 
you know
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember? 
you know
You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature, which is just about completed. 
 just 
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile. 
 just 
First, there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all of space at one time. 
well
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar. 
well
I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff. 
well
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at, just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s, looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction, also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?" 
 just 
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black, you would look just like Al Gore."  Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race. 
you know
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun." If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in. 
well
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this. 
well
But it's not just the developed nations. 
 just 
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense. 
 just 
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there, just to localize this -- which is good news. 
 just 
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially, but also the rest of the world, have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through. 
 just 
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War, we could be well on the way to solving this challenge. 
well
Al Gore: You have no idea.  CA: When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's -- are you excited by their plans on global warming? 
i mean
by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions -- and, by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, "Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that? 
well
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbs. 
 just 
There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly. 
you know
Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots, so this is actually a multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well. 
well
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself. 
 just 
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect -- the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero], that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent. 
 just 
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow. 
 just 
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work. 
 just 
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music? And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince, orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played. 
 just 
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling, I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra, or into something that nobody has ever heard before. 
 just 
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. 
 just 
Everybody can experience music in a profound way, we just have to make different tools. 
 just 
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area -- mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music. 
well
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer. 
you know
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making. 
you know
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move? 
you know
You know, what's his metaphor for performance? 
you know
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. 
 just 
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies -- they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work. 
you know
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express? 
you know
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. 
you know
Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital, just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. 
 just 
It's just been industrial, which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph, and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe. 
 just 
The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer -- the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S., and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer's capable of running -- sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator. 
 just 
Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. 
you know
One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what -- well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it. 
well
Now, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to -- well, not so little, medium little -- tries to do research on Barbie. 
well
And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly, Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object, which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list. 
you see
But remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials -- our PCs -- we share them together. We also see this in wireless. 
 just 
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun. 
 just 
As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging, you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers. 
you see
Instead of building well-behaved appliances -- things that you know what they'll do in advance -- you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values, a new set of things people value. 
well
Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project, you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model. 
you see
And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right? 
you see
That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well. 
well
So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision, a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical. 
you see
This map --  -- this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories, by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago. 
 just 
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent. 
 just 
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story, here's how the world looked. 
 just 
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago. 
well
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that. 
 just 
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those. 
well
These are just for information: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects. 
 just 
But start telling them, you know, we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away. 
you know
But you know, they have that luxury. 
you know
It cannot just be technology, we recognize that. 
 just 
But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done. 
you know
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong. 
i mean
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression. 
you know
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain. 
i suppose
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else? 
you know
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. 
you know
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me. 
you know
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. 
by the way
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about. 
you know
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety. 
 just 
It is constantly there. And, just as an example, this is one that recently came to me. 
 just 
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years. 
you know
Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it? 
well
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came. 
 just 
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck? 
well
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine. 
 just 
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance." 
well
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair. 
well
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there. 
 just 
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen. 
well
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with? 
 just 
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s that works well, describes the motion of planets, the motion of the moon and so forth, the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees, hitting people on the head. 
well
You know, the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth. 
you know
So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space. 
well
Amazing -- it just popped out. 
 just 
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work. 
well
So, let me just tell you how that goes. 
 just 
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question: what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us? 
well
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns, these can also vibrate in different patterns. 
 just 
And there you see unification, because matter particles, electrons and quarks, radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity. 
you see
When you study the mathematics of string theory, you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space. 
 just 
Now you might think about that and say, well, OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up, yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough. 
well
 But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? 
 just 
So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument, strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving. 
 just 
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world, or can we actually test for these extra dimensions? 
 just 
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision, compare it to the amount of energy before, and if there's less energy after the collision than before, this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. 
well
Einstein comes along and says, well, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is. 
well
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now. 
 just 
I'm just the messenger. 
 just 
 What were we just talking about? 
 just 
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left, after only a year become measurably less clogged. 
you see
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe, that are giving you your genetic profiles, are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?" 
well
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes -- they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise, we can actually change how our genes are expressed. 
well
You get some sense of the size -- you can just see these EU standard-size people underneath. 
 just 
And if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles, so it can measure how fast they're traveling. 
you see
And actually, this morning, I got an email saying that we've just finished, today, building the last piece of ATLAS. 
 just 
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious. 
well
And by everything I mean, of course, me and you, the Earth, the Sun, the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. 
i mean
Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it? 
well
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me." 
you know
Well, we found that as you look back in time, the universe gets hotter and hotter, denser and denser, and simpler and simpler. 
well
imagine a snowflake in your hand, and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated, beautiful object. But as you heat it up, it'll melt into a pool of water, and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made of H20, water. 
 just 
The electron -- the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus -- held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing, the photon. 
by the way
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun, passing through every square centimeter of your body. 
 just 
But you don't feel them, because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak, so they just fly through you. 
 just 
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897, and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino, in the year 2000. Actually just -- I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country, America, isn't it? 
 just 
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road. 
 just 
You know, they're a step in size from the entire observable universe. 
you know
OK, we've discovered the particles, but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is -- really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science. 
you know
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies. 
well
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles. 
well
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field. 
well
Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly, essentially at the speed of light. They're massless. 
 just 
Well, they do change in strength. 
well
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model -- you can calculate how these change -- is the forces, the three forces, other than gravity, almost seem to come together at one point. 
you see
But they just miss. 
 just 
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology. 
 just 
But I guess that's in keeping, so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation, ladies and gentlemen. 
 just 
♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫ ♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Now the moth ♫ ♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫ ♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫ ♫ It can't be believed ♫ ♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫ ♫ who's acting like the bird ♫ ♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫ ♫ Got a brand new shipment ♫ 
 just 
♫ I just don't understand you ♫ ♫ I don't understand you ♫ ♫ I do not understand you ♫ ♫ Don't understand you ♫ ♫ Don't understand you ♫ ♫ I turn around ♫ ♫ See the sound ♫ ♫ Turn around and see the thing ♫ ♫ that made the sound. ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ The day that love came to play. ♫ 
 just 
Well, I think we're going to stop that part of the show. 
well
It's actually a children's song but like so many projects for children it's really just a Trojan horse for adult work. 
 just 
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident. 
you know
And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm -- at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. 
i mean
Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that, people ask me and say, "Well, how did your parents treat you when you were a child?" 
well
You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers. 
you know
The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. 
 just 
So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. 
well
And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015, the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. 
well
I was just recently visiting South Africa. 
 just 
Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether it's education or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and I'll explain that in just a minute. 
 just 
What we mean by that is, you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed. 
you know
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology. 
i mean
I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world, and just dumping product and selling into the markets. 
 just 
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa, in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School, and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal. 
you see
And recently, they've written us letters, telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams, on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal. 
 just 
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part, and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this. 
 just 
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. 
well
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know, I'm going to remind you again, that each generation has to do better than the last one. 
you know
But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. 
 just 
It inhales oxygen, just like we do. 
 just 
These are little wells. 
well
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form. 
well
Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward -- 65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an asteroid impact. 
you know
More recently, at Einstein University, they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy, much like plants use light. 
 just 
So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites. 
well
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept, because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi, prior to sporulation, attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores. 
 um
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference -- you add soil, you add water, you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores, like of the Agarikon mushroom. 
well
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels. 
 just 
But I'm not just doing this to be cute. 
 just 
You actually see a great potential, but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf, and may actually be very resistant, when one tries to introduce ideas. 
you see
And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms, as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease, is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view, germ's-eye view. 
well
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view, disease organisms have to get from one host to another, and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host. 
well
So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria, and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful. 
 just 
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs, but the main point here is that --  there's a lot of them here, I can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong, positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water, and how harmful they are, how much death they cause per untreated infection. 
 just 
Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission, you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph. 
 just 
I mean, if this would require thousands of years, then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens. 
i mean
But if it could occur in just a few years, then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control. 
 just 
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991. 
 just 
Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile, which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America? 
well
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador, which has some of the least well protected? 
well
And to just give you a sense of how important this might be, if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years. 
 just 
But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries, and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness. 
 just 
In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity -- and I won't go into that. 
 just 
But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later, we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem. 
 just 
And I want to give you just one more example, because we've talked a little bit about malaria. 
 just 
And you can show, just by looking at data from literature, that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases. 
 just 
Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama. 
well
And so what you can see is that just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else, caused the eradication of malaria. 
 just 
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone, sub-Saharan Africa. 
you know
So, this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. 
 just 
So, I don't really have time to talk about those things, but I did want to put them up there, just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. 
 just 
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts. 
 just 
But people just haven't been able to justify the cost. 
 just 
If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water, then I think that we can say, let's push the effort into that aspect of the control, so that we can actually solve the problem, even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection, you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply. 
well
Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about. 
well
But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling, and basically visual music, I guess. 
i guess
Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet, and controlling the balls with my feet. 
 just 
You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something. 
you see
Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. 
well
Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that, it's a process of joining with forces. 
well
Well, that's what juggling is about, right? 
well
 OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. 
 just 
 How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives, a moment of learning, a moment of challenge. 
well
You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat? 
you know
 You know, what are you supposed to do? 
you know
It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK? 
 just 
I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this. 
 just 
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. 
well
Well, obviously, there's something in here, and you can all have a guess as to what it is. 
well
And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time. 
 just 
But I just thought I'd talk about a moment. 
 just 
 Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference. 
 just 
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents. 
well
I'm going to do just a short version of it. 
 just 
  Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it, and I dance around a small stage so -- two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on -- what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it. 
 just 
Well, because then it tells me the truth, instead of me imposing the truth. 
well
Because my attempt is to make visual instruments, not to just make -- I'll try one other thing. 
 just 
I said that was stupid, you know, maybe we should just train them to do something useful. 
you know
 And after 10 years of this, my wife eventually said, "Look, you know, you gotta do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine." 
you know
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time. 
 just 
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species. 
well
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving. 
 just 
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there. 
 just 
You see, it wasn't working very well. 
well
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane. 
 just 
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian. 
 just 
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal. 
you know
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail. 
well
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed. 
 just 
I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. 
 just 
But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. 
well
That's just the United States. 
 just 
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. 
 just 
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore," which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. 
 just 
You just ate. 
 just 
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. 
well
Well, they kept them alive. 
well
It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began, the thing we're only realizing just now. 
 just 
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. 
well
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians, the vegans, the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. 
 just 
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. 
 just 
During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. 
 just 
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better. 
well
Well, there's also another program, in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration. 
well
Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place that has nothing to offer? 
 just 
In fact, I have another version at my office and I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here, but there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee, I don't know," saying, "Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?" 
well
All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because, you know, it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents. 
you know
 You know, it's just ludicrous. 
you know
You know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else. 
you know
I believe in just enriching the economy. 
 just 
Do the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave, and I was too young to be -- you know, I thought it was great! 
you know
So, it's a phenomenally active region, it's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place. 
 just 
That's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest. 
you know
Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade: copper, lead, silver, zinc and gold. 
you see
Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach, unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby, we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems. 
 just 
Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge. 
you know
Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea -- human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic. 
 just 
And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine, blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day. 
 just 
Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away, and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing. 
 just 
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. 
i mean
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in. 
 just 
It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous. 
well
 I mean, look at those graphics there. 
i mean
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know." 
well
And they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke. 
you know
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?" 
i mean
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing? 
you know
"You know, do people really use it? 
you know
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience. 
 just 
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want. 
 just 
You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy. 
you know
I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face. 
i mean
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out. 
you know
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure. 
you know
 And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask. 
well
I mean, to me, it just means so much. 
 just 
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers. 
you know
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is. 
i mean
So, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia. 
you see
I mean it's colorful, it's fun. 
i mean
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago. 
 just 
And I was just in New York at the launch, and I went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store; at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall. 
 just 
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere. 
i mean
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them. They were excited. 
you know
 So, I'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, I think we can change the work that we do. 
 just 
I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces, and there's no real connection between one or the other, except that they sort of come out of my brain, and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects, and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things. 
 just 
And it's full of many little trivial end points, like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. 
 just 
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality. 
 just 
You know, they say, never play with your food -- but I always play with things. 
you know
And they would coalesce for just a moment, so you could perceive that there was a chair there. 
 just 
 So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. 
 just 
  And it's really, just sort of -- for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. 
 just 
It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --  -- this is a happy machine, I'll tell you. 
 just 
From an engineering point of view, this is just a little four-bar linkage. 
 just 
I just like, throw it in. 
 just 
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in. 
i mean
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ... 
 just 
The object itself just means nothing. 
 just 
So I'll just let this chair come down. 
 just 
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home. 
 just 
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map, and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of. 
 just 
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them. 
well
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these, and I didn't have a helmet, either. 
 just 
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital. 
 just 
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time, "You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country." 
you know
And she's right. Every time you go there, you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go? 
you know
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as, AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on. 
well
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination, malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there. 
you know
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope." 
well
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place, but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier? 
you know
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy? 
you know
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says, "Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to, you can't do this, I just know it." 
 just 
Yes, let's just go work this thing out. 
 just 
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that. 
 just 
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays. 
 just 
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please. 
i mean
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. 
well
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right? 
 just 
This is what I mean about appropriate technology. 
i mean
Have you seen one of those before? 
you see
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff. 
 just 
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there. 
well
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case. 
 just 
There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got. 
 just 
Well, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin. 
well
I would say not just biological design, but all of the design that we think of as human design. 
 just 
It's all just the same thing happening. 
 just 
I know you know the idea, natural selection, but let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859, in a few sentences. 
you know
You see the idea? 
you see
The principle is you just need those three things -- variation, selection and heredity. 
 just 
Well, the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection. 
well
It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't, because it's just information being copied. 
 just 
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme. 
 just 
Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way. 
well
Oh, well, your earrings, I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings. 
well
All the stories that we're telling -- well, of course, TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes. 
well
You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere, and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see? 
you see
SB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see? 
you see
 Other people are just lazy and make mistakes. 
 just 
I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place, and it's all lovely. 
i suppose
A new replicator was let loose, and it could never be -- right from the start -- it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature, could just copy the useful, beautiful, true things, and not copy the other things. 
 just 
All other species on this planet are gene machines only, they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all. 
well
We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well. 
well
Well, we did pull through on this planet. 
well
You know all about big brains. 
you know
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight? 
you know
Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off, and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know. 
you see
Well, we did pull through, and we adapted. 
well
But now, we're hitting, as I've just described, we're hitting the third replicator point. 
 just 
And this is even more dangerous -- well, it's dangerous again. 
well
They're just information, why would they? 
 just 
Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through. 
well
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion" is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years, and hence diverging from the rest of mankind. 
well
Well, a good guide is to think, "What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world?" 
well
Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much. 
well
Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it. 
well
Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four. 
 just 
I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest, the one that's just motherhood and apple pie -- governments, mutual systems of support for governments -- and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance, and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. 
 just 
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high, but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. 
 just 
Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth; Ghana has discovered oil; Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground. 
 just 
And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great. 
 just 
Well, the short run, it's hunky dory, but the long run, it's humpty dumpty. 
well
So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion. 
well
In all the societies of the bottom billion, there are intense struggles to do just that. 
 just 
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment, how they've been sold over the last 40 years? 
you know
 And, you know, "Excuse me!" 
you know
 Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins. 
 just 
I don't know, you know? 
you know
Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?" 
well
 And, one thing that isn't a mystery, actually, was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures -- and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face? 
well
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing. 
i mean
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all, and we're going to do a very high-res digitization, first because it's a way of preserving them. 
 just 
But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well. 
well
Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light -- come in, and they just squish around the cell, and they come back the other side. 
 just 
Metamaterials, unfortunately -- A, it only works on microwave, and B, it doesn't work all that well yet. 
well
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business, but, in fact, it's negative. 
you know
And these happen to be my eyes, by the way. 
by the way
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity, and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock. 
 oh 
You know, a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism, which is kind of cool, but Jill has what I call slow heroism. 
you know
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie? 
well
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on." 
well
 I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home, and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible! 
you know
You know, skiers pray for snow? 
you know
You hike around, you see something like this. 
you see
You've got this bentonite clay, which is -- sort of swells up and expands. 
well
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually, from the shape, that these are skull fragments. 
well
You know. 
you know
I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy." 
well
You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing, passion in life, and focusing all your energy on it, and I've never been able to do that. 
you know
I just -- you know, because, yes, I'll focus passion on something, but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again. 
you know
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought, "Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down." 
well
And you know, when I was at Microsoft, that was so engrossing, and the whole industry was expanding so much, that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life. 
you know
And say, "Yeah, you know, I -- this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep, but that's really what works for me." 
you know
 There's a study some of you think you know about, but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie. 
you know
People say, "No, that's Nazi Germany, Hitler, you know, that's 1939." 
you know
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts. This was just one study. 
 just 
In study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way, 90 percent go all the way. 
you see
In study five, if you see people rebel, 90 percent rebel. 
you see
So they, right there, you know, they took me out the door, they put my hands against the car. 
you know
I was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell, which was just like a room with a door with bars on it. 
 just 
You don't need it. You just need the social-psychological processes. 
 just 
She saw that madhouse and said, "You know what, it's terrible what you're doing to those boys. 
you know
  I just came to my senses, obviously. 
 just 
You know what? They freeze. 
you know
You know, culture was born of the imagination, and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being when our species descended from our progenitor, Homo erectus, and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world. 
you know
He said, "You know, clearly at some point, we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't." 
you know
If these were postcards of nostalgia, ours was a very long farewell indeed. 
well
But what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence? 
i mean
Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination, that of Polynesia. 
well
These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon, simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well that every island group in the Pacific has its unique refractive pattern with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint. 
well
These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel, can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time, distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean, that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea. 
well
Their billboards are manuals, prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures. 
well
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe you went to the moon, but you did. 
you know
The gourd you see here is -- everything in their lives is symbolic. 
you see
You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes, they're burnt limestone -- to empower the coca leaf, to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride. 
well
I traveled with the Arhuacos, and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man, Danilo Villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second. 
 just 
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington, I couldn't help but say, "You know, you look a lot like an old friend of mine." 
you know
Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto, from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC. 
well
And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet -- there must be nothing between the feet and the Earth for a mamo. 
you see
And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos, and yet, still they pray. 
you see
And it's an amazing thing to think that this close to Miami, two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well-being. 
well
On the contrary, you know, if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see, you discover that the world is not flat. 
you know
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value, instead of just being chaos? 
 just 
Right? If I had given this talk last year, I couldn't do what I just did, because I couldn't have found those photos. 
 just 
No good just hiring employees, you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth. 
 just 
You just said, "I'll call you when I get there." 
 just 
To say instead of, we must make an advance plan, we must have a five-year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever, you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort, and let's deal with it as we go, because we're now well-enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do. 
well
You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily: if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system, they account for three quarters of the photos taken -- just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers. 
 just 
When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup, he thought it would be used for, you know, train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups. 
you know
So, there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment, trying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these. 
well
And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming, my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it. 
well
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics. 
well
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. 
well
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right. 
well
You may just know more about everything than anyone. 
 just 
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet -- and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing, which also goes back to Turing, who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless, little, finite state machine, just reading a tape in and reading a tape out. 
 just 
But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know, we saw it in starting these programs up. 
you know
RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know, televisions are the future, not computers. 
you know
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running, let alone having, you know, software problems. 
you know
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing." 
 just 
And sometimes things are okay. 
okay
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess. 
i guess
But they're just going to stay numbers; they're not going to become organisms. 
 just 
It just was another version of the same thing happening. 
 just 
You know, could we get them running? 
you know
And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins, and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world. 
 just 
And all our computers have, inside them, the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day, sort of on pencil and paper. 
 just 
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors that we're in denial about, and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness. 
i mean
This is an image I just recently completed, that is -- when you stand back at a distance, it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution. 
 just 
And, as you slowly step back, you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette." 
you see
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness. 
 just 
This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes, which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S. 
 just 
Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times. 
well
 And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills, which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States, attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications. 
you see
This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon, this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery. 
 just 
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls, and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern, and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls, which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. 
you see
Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples. 
 just 
They're just examples. 
 just 
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend. 
 just 
And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions. 
well
I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible. 
 just 
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation. 
 just 
Well, many biologists will tell engineers, and others, organisms have millions of years to get it right; they're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well. 
well
So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly. 
 just 
How can you make sense of this? Well, we believed -- and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply, is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves. 
well
Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog, or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect, or four legs as one of a trotting crab. 
well
And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well. 
well
And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane, when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question. 
 just 
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs, we collapsed them down as one. 
well
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it, you give it a push, as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain or no reflexes, just by the structure alone. 
 just 
Well, I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies, at least they have been so far. 
well
Think about the typical kind of robot that you see. 
you see
It just bends by itself beautifully. 
 just 
Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability. 
well
It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front, and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod, and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal. 
 just 
 Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything, it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system, with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal. 
 just 
Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them we should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on Mars. 
 just 
 Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible, we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell. 
okay
It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill. 
 just 
Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out -- that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works. 
you see
And if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times, you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully, those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times, you'll see each hair has split ends. 
you see
They don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine. 
 just 
You know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry, where you had these two atoms, they're close together, and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times with these small structures. 
you know
And just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning, dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this. 
 just 
  We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this that we realized that that small-size scale -- and where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore -- we needed to look at ants and their feet, because one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well. 
well
I just looked at it, and I didn't know what to do. 
 just 
I mean, this was -- was I my things? 
i mean
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year. 
by the way
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces, which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project. 
 just 
I just instead said, "I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... " And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who've already given me so much solace, and just say to TEDsters: I'm proud of me. That I take something bad, I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this, all these pieces. 
 just 
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film. 
i mean
That's my wife, Heidi, who didn't take it as well as I did. 
well
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon, just 35 miles from here. 
 just 
You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment. It's really cheap. 
 just 
Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1900s. 
you know
You see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note. 
you see
 You know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing, when I was working with a young pianist. 
you know
 You know, you've come home from a long day, and you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up. 
you know
It's just simply not part of your life. 
 just 
And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello," you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in. 
you know
 Do you know what I think probably happened here? 
you know
If they want sad music, they just play those two notes. 
 just 
You know, every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China -- everybody knows: da, da, da, da -- da. Everybody knows, who's expecting that E. 
you know
It's the same with the Chopin. He's just about to reach the E, and he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again." 
 just 
You know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years. 
you know
Well, I did this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds. 
well
And one of them came to me the next morning and he said, "You know, I've never listened to classical music in my life, but when you played that shopping piece ..." 
you know
If you thought, "Everybody loves classical music -- they just haven't found out about it yet." 
 just 
If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it. 
you know
 Right. So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it. 
you know
And you know, I have a definition of success. 
you know
♫ My oh my, walking by, who’s the apple of my eye? ♫ ♫ Why, it's my very own Clonie. ♫ ♫ Oh, if I should stroll the hood, who knew I could look so good ♫ ♫ just talking on the phone to Clonie. ♫ ♫ We are pals, it's cool, 'cause we're not lonely, ♫ ♫ shallow gene pool is nothing to my only Clonie. ♫ ♫ Me and you, hustling through, holding on through thick and thin, ♫ 
 oh 
♫ just day by day, our DNA, so the Olson twins got nothing on us. ♫ ♫ We'll survive, side by side.

well
In fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well -- and I did, too -- in the arts: this was my passion. 
well
He said to me something that just went completely over my head. 
 just 
He said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits, but I don't like grey pin-striped suits." 
you know
And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on, I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project. 
well
My career, I mean, I'd done my career. 
i mean
So they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there. 
you see
This picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced. 
 just 
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. 
 just 
Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are -- there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK? 
okay
This is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri -- who's here, many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia, set up this school that we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet. 
you know
These kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. 
 just 
Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way. 
by the way
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things. 
 just 
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.  So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. 
by the way
And, in English, the word "cheap" has a double meaning, which is really appropriate, because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive. 
well
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody -- you know, good design is very important. 
you know
The mesh network, the reason I -- and I won't go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world, they're connected. There's not just laptops. 
 just 
Latin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages. 
 just 
And it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries -- I say former, because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity, make a press release. 
i mean
He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us, nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power, but just a vanilla laptop proposal. 
 just 
Add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said, "Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September, we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end -- just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. 
 just 
We said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31. 
 just 
The first day it was just wild. And then we said, "Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one, but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in. 
well
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay? 
okay
I won't dwell on the pricing at all. 
well
But it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do -- I've just said it. Don't just give one, get one. 
 just 
I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even 24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours. 
 just 
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight. 
well
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this. 
well
And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go. 
you know
My search is always to find ways to chronicle, to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people. 
 just 
So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us. 
 just 
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window. 
you know
This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed. 
 just 
 So, here are these women, who never discuss their period with their husbands, and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?" 
well
 And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into -- you're teaching him how to be a woman." 
you know
And she said, "You know, you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror. 
you know
Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda, the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one? 
you know
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. 
 just 
So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything, but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas. 
you know
So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany, and we had the Catholic priest over, my mother was entertaining him with tea. 
 just 
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back, so he summoned me up, and he said, "Go into the bedroom, my bedroom. 
 just 
 And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered, just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said, "It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish." 
 just 
Then I'd say, "How do you know?" 
you know
♫ Feminists don't have a sense of humor. ♫ ♫ Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo, hoo, hoo. ♫ ♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫ ♫ They have a tumor on their funny bone. ♫ ♫ They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha, ha, ha, ha. ♫ ♫ Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up, ladies. ♫ ♫ Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what’s wrong with that? ♫ 
 just 
♫ that's why these feminists just need to find a man. ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫ I’m Dennis Kucinich and I approved this message. 
 just 
I asked my mother, you know, should I say anything in support of anyone? 
you know
And she said, "Oh no! Just dis everybody, except Ralph Nader." 
 just 
♫ sail the mighty ocean wide. ♫ ♫ I could cross the burning desert, if I had you by my side. ♫ ♫ I could be a king, dear, uncrowned, humble or poor, rich or renowned. ♫ ♫ There is nothing I couldn’t do, if I had you. ♫ Thank you. Well, thank you so much. 
well
I spent a few days photographing children in different countries, and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists, I always hope that when my pictures were published, they might actually have an effect on a situation, instead of just documenting it. 
 just 
And the guy just told me, "There's no way. This grandmother won't even -- you know, there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising." 
you know
And I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator if it would be OK if I stayed for the week. 
 ok 
And I just told the little girl, whose name was Hyun-Sook Lee, that if I ever did anything to embarrass her -- she didn't speak a word of English, although she looked very American -- she could just put up her hand and say, "Stop," and I would stop taking pictures. 
 just 
And so, she really just completely ignored me most of the time. 
 just 
I mean I had fallen in love with this girl, but I -- you know, it was, like, emotionally I was about 12 years old. 
you know
If you know of photographers, the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented. 
you know
And I said, "I'll pay for the ... " I mean, I had this whole sort of picture. 
i mean
And I said, "Well, tell him that I am a photographer." 
well
I said, "Well, tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother to find a family for her." 
well
So I was -- you know, the door was being slammed in my face, it's incredibly cold, and I'm trying to think, "What would the hero do in a movie, if I was writing this as a movie script?" 
you know
So I said, "Listen, it's really cold, I've come a very long way, do you mind if I just come in for a minute? I'm freezing." 
 just 
So I finally decided, I said "Look," -- this is all through the translator, because, this is all, you know, I don't speak a word of Korean -- and I said, "Look, I'm really glad that Hyun-Sook has a family to live with. 
you know
I said, "But you know, I bought an airline ticket, and I'm stuck here for a week." 
you know
And just -- I want him to understand what happens if she stays here. 
 just 
And we went outside, and he was just furious. 
 just 
And she said, "Well, he's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house, some rich American with your cameras around your neck, accusing me of enslaving my niece? 
well
Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this?'" And I said, you know, "Look," I said, "You're absolutely right. 
you know
I just think that -- what little I know about the situation, she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have." 
 just 
And you can see how different she looks just in three months. 
 just 
Well, there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story, who had 75 children living in his house. 
well
This is Father Keene. He's just a wonderful guy. 
 just 
And there's clothes, and there's kids, and, you know, there's three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine. 
you know
And the third night, we came back, we'd just gone out to dinner, where you saw the pictures, and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said, "There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight, so if you want to put the kids five floors below you, there's a room there." 
 just 
We were just like, you know, ah, just full of ourselves. 
you know
And we fall asleep -- and I've been in this room, you know, for a couple of months now. 
you know
So, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing, I go to close the window, and I hear people shouting outside, and I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out." 
 just 
So, the two of us were just like, "Oh my God, oh my God." 
 oh 
And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour, it's like they took five Valiums -- you know, they're all over the place. 
you know
I just remember this unbelievable, just utter chaos. 
 just 
I remember sitting near the bed, and I was just so -- I had two overwhelming feelings. 
 just 
One was absolute terror -- it's like, "Oh, please God, I just want to wake up. 
 just 
Please, I just want to wake up, it's got to be a nightmare." 
 just 
I remember just being so frightened and terrified. 
 just 
I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene. 
i mean
In any case, 12 hours later, I mean, they put us in the lobby. 
i mean
It was one of just the most horrifying nights. 
 just 
It's so weird how life just goes on. 
 just 
So you know, if you were writing this, you'd say, "No, we've got to write the script differently." 
you know
Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up, because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer, and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well, in the beginning. 
well
And Kylie -- I mean, it was almost like Kylie was her own child. 
i mean
It's just, you know, it was just so interesting, just to watch -- this is her mother in the background there. 
you know
Natasha, would you just come up, for a second, just maybe to say hello to everybody? 
 just 
I mean, she -- you know, we've looked at the pictures together. 
you know
♫ You can, I can, she can, he can, ♫ ♫ we can make a little bit of difference in this world. ♫ ♫ Everybody gonna make a little ♫ ♫ little difference, yeah. ♫ ♫ Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference. ♫ ♫ Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world, ♫ ♫ oh yeah. ♫  Thank you so much. 
 oh 
I think you guys know it quite well. 
well
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, that most of you know, life became very, very difficult. 
you know
And what I did, I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis. 
 just 
And he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?" 
you know
After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi, they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area where the zoo, where Okapi was born. 
 just 
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks. 
 just 
But many of them are just here, because they don't have money. 
 just 
So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen, and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game. 
 just 
And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because, I mean, it's very, very trivial. 
i mean
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this. 
 just 
So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk. 
well
We heard about those already yesterday, and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already. 
i suppose
But, just briefly, the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals -- neural networks, in this case -- all of which are random at the beginning. 
 just 
Those are then selected by the algorithm, reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well. 
well
I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results, and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line, like I've just demonstrated, and this is what I got instead. 
 just 
It was, academically, quite a challenging project, and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it. 
well
What you see here is the character standing there, and there's an obstacle that we put in its way. 
you see
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle. 
you see
 Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there, are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles. 
you see
Okay. That's the video. Thanks. 
okay
What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body. 
you see
Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment, is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens. 
 just 
So that's what you see here. 
you see
if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well. 
well
I'm going to push it a bit harder now, harder than I just pushed Chris. 
 just 
What you see is it takes steps backwards, it tries to counter-balance, it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land. 
you see
Now, this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done. 
 just 
So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you, but now I'm just going to push it from different directions. 
 just 
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on. 
by the way
And you see it falls differently. 
you see
This is the first time the public sees this as well, because we have been in stealth mode. 
well
Now, just a fun thing: what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice. 
 just 
We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens. 
 just 
We just took this character that I just talked about, put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it. 
 just 
So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked. 
 just 
 There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ... 
by the way
So that you don't have a character that looks limp, but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away, that looks kind of alive in midair as well. 
well
So this character is going to be hit by a force, it's going to realize it's in the air, and it's going to try and, well, stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing. 
well
And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization. 
 just 
This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London, who are using our software and experimenting with it right now. 
 just 
So if you look at the character carefully, you see there are lots of body movements going on, none of which you have to animate like in the old days. 
you see
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically. 
 just 
Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look. 
 just 
Yes, you can just about see it here. 
 just 
Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves, "Can we do that ourselves as well?" 
well
We did that. It took about altogether just two hours, pretty much, to create the simulation. 
 just 
Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages, and we pretty much just did this for a laugh, just to see what we'd get out of it. 
 just 
Just finally, this is only just the beginning. 
 just 
He just started to create that dance himself. 
 just 
And what you see after a while -- I think he even goes into a climax right at the end. 
you see
That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically. 
 just 
So it's just --  Thanks. 
 just 
Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well, so thanks very much for your time. 
well
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. 
 just 
It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. 
 just 
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All," and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending. 
well
You can just Google it. 
 just 
You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying -- you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it. 
you know
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind, and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around. 
you know
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. 
you know
So, it really was cognitive psychology -- you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing. 
you know
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. 
you know
And I explained my project, and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?" 
well
And I said, "Well, that would be great!" 
well
 And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand. 
you know
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. 
you know
Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? 
you know
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. 
 just 
Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. 
well
So, you know, I met with creationists. 
you know
It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. 
 just 
This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. 
you know
And they said, "We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning." 
 just 
And they would say, "Well, what about you? 
well
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational. 
well
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion. 
 just 
You're just picking and choosing." 
 just 
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. 
well
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. 
 just 
 Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. 
well
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology, because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist -- so everything I know about it can be said in one minute. 
 just 
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate, just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa, to go down through the ice, find out who is swimming around in the ocean, whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods. 
 just 
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick, so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there -- send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore. 
 just 
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which, in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud -- these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there but they are biologically very interesting indeed, because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals, which are just the right ones for developing life. 
 just 
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth. 
 just 
But if they just simply could grow, like leaves, little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight, then they could keep warm on the surface. 
 just 
There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there. And I mean, the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole. 
i mean
Well, of course, as soon as anybody did look, which was after about 20 years, when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun. 
well
So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life, which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. 
 just 
You see the red glow in their eyes, which is the reflection of the flashlight. 
you see
And then, when you shine sunlight at them, the sunlight will be reflected back, just as it is in the eyes of an animal. 
 just 
We're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck. 
well
What's going to happen in the end, it's not going to be just humans colonizing space, it's going to be life moving out from the Earth, moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life, of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there, it makes it much more exciting, in the short run. 
 just 
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting our third experiment: studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage. 
 just 
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. 
 just 
You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life -- but no, you just love them harder. 
you know
You know, you're lying there, you're looking at the picture, and you're in this machine, and you're calculating, you know, what went wrong. 
you know
How, you know, what have I lost? 
you know
Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time, conserve your mating energy, and start the mating process with this single individual. 
 just 
I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly. 
well
I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair. 
 just 
Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage -- and you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box, you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with -- but I've looked in a hundred species, and everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites. 
you know
And I just simply say, "Hardly." 
 just 
And finally, John Belk said, "Do you know who's sitting here?" 
you know
 And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people. 
i suppose
You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. 
you see
Thomas Edison also said, "When you see everything that happens in the world of science, and in the working of the universe, you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge." 
you see
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well. 
well
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, "I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. 
well
And afterward, she said, "You know, I'm an atheist, but I know that there's something up there higher than we are." 
you know
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our -- many young people think she's still alive. 
 just 
And they're -- they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. 
 just 
I knew Dr. von Braun very well. 
well
It was he who penned the well-known words, "The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of." 
well
Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. 
well
It can be yours, as well, as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. 
well
I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. 
you know
 Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how. 
you know
 Now, I remember when I was about 15, I read a copy of Life magazine, which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters -- there's still people trying to do it --  -- who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch. 
 just 
You know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind -- a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms, where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. 
you know
And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. 
 just 
KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road. 
 just 
KB: Just don't break my concentration. 
 just 
By the way, two days ago, we were going to film this down there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car, and we got a camera man in the back, but halfway through the drive, he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter, stuck to his leg. 
by the way
So, I want you to just think about it for a moment. 
 just 
A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened, all right. 
 just 
You see, it's very simple, once you know how, but very complicated in other ways. 
you know
Would you mind just standing over here for a moment? 
 just 
I want you to just stand exactly like this for me, pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind. 
 just 
I just touched his back, and I just touched his arm. 
 just 
Now, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK, just take a deep breath in through your nose, letting it out through your mouth, and relax. 
 just 
And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here. 
 just 
I want you to hold it there just for a moment, and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness, and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. 
 just 
Do you understand? Just answer yes or no. 
 just 
Can you stand up? Just stand, stage forward. 
 just 
It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened. 
 ok 
Most people ask you, "What the hell just happened up here?" 
 just 
But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized, you will forget everything that happened. 
 ok 
 You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. 
you see
Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him. 
you see
 CA: Well, to reward him for saying "eureka," and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us -- Steve Jurvetson. 
well
KB: Yes, and just to help you out, I'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing. 
 just 
KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden. 
well
 Now, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct? 
you know
So I said, "Well, how many words do I get?" 
well
And she said, "Well, one." 
well
"Well, how many words do I get this time?" "I think, well, you get two. 
well
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model. 
well
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. 
 just 
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. 
 just 
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent. 
 just 
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment. 
 just 
Pleasure has raw feels: you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling. 
you know
And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. 
 just 
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect, when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. 
 just 
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and to contrast it. 
well
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes. 
well
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. 
by the way
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough -- there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life. 
 just 
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary. 
well
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape. 
 just 
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. 
 just 
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there. 
 just 
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died. 
well
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. 
well
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia. 
well
The question now is, well, who are we? 
well
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers. 
i mean
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip. 
 just 
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course? 
 just 
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end. 
well
And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years, I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts, but also the artifacts of other people. 
you know
As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story, and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. 
 just 
So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University, and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts, not just from street corners, but also from the Internet. 
 just 
And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. 
you see
The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio, photographs, movies, even lectures like this one -- we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position, some kind of omniscient, external body through whose eyes you see the story. 
you see
I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex, and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. 
i mean
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this. 
 just 
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt" and the two whales that were killed down here. 
you see
And now we've whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs, and then we can enter the narrative at that position. 
 just 
They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades, and an incredibly efficient process. 
 just 
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that, I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. 
 just 
And it leads to just a completely different value system. 
 just 
But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy. 
you know
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with. 
 just 
This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight, but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. 
 just 
But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people. 
 just 
I asked her about her wish, and she said, "You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish." 
you know
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said, "Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent, but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage." 
well
And she said, "Well, you know, I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave." 
well
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way -- with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from. 
 just 
What if she saw the truth after just one year, what would she do for the next 35 years in her life? 
 just 
Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent. 
you know
JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it. 
well
 You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it. 
you know
You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z. 
well
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. 
 just 
These are just not things we talked about very often. 
 just 
Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here. 
you see
Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. 
 just 
Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. 
 just 
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us. 
i mean
I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day. 
i mean
This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building? No. 
 just 
The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine. 
 just 
And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do? 
well
Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. 
 just 
This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today. 
well
Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. 
 just 
So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop. 
 just 
This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed. 
 just 
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines, but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine. 
 just 
And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days; the Web is only 5,000 days. 
 just 
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell, but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet, if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. 
well
It's just a huge machine, and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. 
 just 
So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk. 
 just 
So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things. 
well
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple, and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine, you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. 
 just 
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah -- all these things are going to become Web based. 
 just 
So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things. 
 just 
And so, giving an example of this thing, I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. 
 just 
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once, and it should know who all your friends are. 
 just 
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified, and you should just carry these relationships around. 
 just 
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page, or your computer. 
 just 
And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things. 
 just 
Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google. 
 just 
We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things -- I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. 
 just 
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better -- it's going to be something different. 
 just 
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better," but a new kind of stage in this development. 
 just 
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is. 
 just 
And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system. 
 just 
What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now, is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. 
 just 
And it's actually as much as your laptop computer: it's just 10 watts. 
 just 
And let me just summarize. So the bottom line: the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. 
 just 
Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. 
 just 
In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. 
 just 
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides. 
 just 
And that current, electrical current, is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on. 
 just 
I mean, neurons have thousands of these. 
i mean
And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. 
 just 
So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern. 
 just 
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. 
you see
They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain. 
 just 
And they figured out all the different cells, and they figured out the network, and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. 
 just 
And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. 
 just 
This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. 
you see
And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip. 
you see
So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. 
you know
When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts. 
 just 
And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here and something happens in your background, you merely move your eyes to it. 
you know
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano, OK. 
 just 
I don't think that I would've had that reaction, if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction, hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know, buying into this hype about computers. 
you know
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797. 
you know
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. 
 just 
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. 
 just 
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes. 
 just 
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?" 
i mean
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps. 
well
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. 
well
Well, there are other ways of making a flap. 
well
And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. 
 just 
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?" 
well
 And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern. 
 just 
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed -- which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern. 
 just 
And you can do more than just insects. 
 just 
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass -- that's not so hot. 
well
Well, then you could do an organ. 
well
  Just to show you, this really was folded paper. 
 just 
And we can use this not just for visuals, but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. 
 just 
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow. 
well
You know, where did these things come from? 
you know
Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school. 
well
The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs. 
 just 
You see some incredible stuff. 
you see
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took. 
well
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. 
well
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes. 
well
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. 
well
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family. 
 just 
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape. 
well
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, "Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories." 
well
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era. 
well
Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. 
well
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do. 
well
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. 
well
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans. 
well
Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer. 
well
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. 
well
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today. 
 just 
Well, you want the ultimate African success story? 
well
The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. 
 just 
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. 
 just 
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, "You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. 
you know
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level. 
you know
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that. 
well
And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from, you know, a handful of populations around the world. 
you know
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more -- hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world." 
 just 
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars. 
 just 
So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space. 
well
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. 
 just 
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it. 
 just 
But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?" 
 just 
Instead of just knowledge of this park, he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues Now let's go over to India. 
 just 
And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget." 
well
we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put Jonas into Dharavi, which is part of Mumbai, India, and let him stay there, and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. 
 just 
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. 
 just 
I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch, the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. 
 ok 
But there are also glimmers of hope, and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this, we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. 
 just 
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun. 
 just 
Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have." 
you know
 Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. 
 just 
 Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. 
 just 
This is her just puffing out, you know, snorting out in disgust. 
you know
Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature, and came back with not just a collection of photographs, but an amazing experience and a great story. 
 just 
It is these kinds of stories, ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. 
 just

 just 
♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫ ♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫ ♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫ ♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫ ♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫ ♫ catching some sun.

 just 
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators, such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road, to study things on the smallest scale. 
 just 
So, recently, we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe -- and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me, the planets, the stars, the galaxies -- the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. 
i mean
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. 
i mean
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK. 
you know
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance -- this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK -- we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. 
 ok 
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK. 
well
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well. 
well
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there. 
 just 
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right? 
well
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies -- those are the galaxies in the cluster. 
well
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe -- and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK -- and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are. 
 ok 
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate. 
well
So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again. 
you know
In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any, you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy. 
you know
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter. 
well
Now, what do I mean by well motivated? 
well
I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK, things that I haven't even talked about, that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting, new particle. 
i mean
They just pass through anything. 
 just 
 With queens and -- it's OK -- queens and tens. 
 ok 
So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. 
you see
LG: Here -- you see some are missing? 
you see
 No, now and then I put in a mistake, just to emphasize how difficult it is. 
 just 
It's called "Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible, but not so many people know, if you check, if you press at the right spots, you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right? 
you see
But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals -- the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. 
you know
And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way, and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate, then you go to -- then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... 
 just 
You see, yeah, perfect. 
you see
For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas, and you're betting, and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card. 
 just 
So here, I grab -- you know this? Five of clubs ... 
you know
This -- oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault. 
 oh 
No?  LG: But you see the hand. 
you see
You see the cards? Yes. 
you see
You see, I don't work with prestige, so always do mistakes. 
you see
One, two, three, four -- yes, the camera got it? Five, six, seven, eight -- ah -- nine, 10, the jack, jack of spades, queen of -- I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen. 
 ah 
Stop. Do you see the pattern? 
you see
CA: You're peeking. You just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back. 
 just 
 Okay. 
okay
So here, all the cards are face down -- you agree?  LG: Yes? You see that in the screen? 
you see
Touch me, feel -- ah, ah, you know! 
you know
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you. 
okay
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it, and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here," and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting. 
you know
I mean, you lose. 
i mean
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg -- you know, isn't that nice? 
you know
His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later, he weighs, you know, 80 pounds. 
you know
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get. 
i mean
They are just so beatable, and that's why they get beaten. 
 just 
I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?" 
well
And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess." 
well
Well, I've got news for you. 
well
You know, "Sit, sit." 
you know
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner." 
you know
And I can imagine this dog, you know, speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita, saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train. 
you know
It's like, if I just sit, that's my command. 
 just 
Now we move to phase three, when now -- there's times, you know, when daddy knows best. 
you know
You see, the punishment was working. 
you see
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class. 
 just 
I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one. 
i mean
You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here. 
you see
 I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that? 
i mean
You know, I puppy-train my child. 
you know
I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on." 
you know
I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness. 
i mean
You know, kind of like a little robot. 
you know
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents. 
you see
You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee. 
you see
You know, calculus is wonderful. 
you know
Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics -- these are cool things. 
you know
And my look to the future is, and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people that you know, your husband's just as easy to train. 
you know
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship? 
you know
No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits, which are just as hard to break as bad habits. 
 just 
You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. 
you know
And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition. 
 just 
We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. 
you know
And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. 
you know
He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. 
 just 
And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute. 
by the way
This is -- we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. 
you know
So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. 
 just 
And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. 
 just 
And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, "I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano." 
you know
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know. 
you know
 I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. 
 just 
Right, do you know where I'm going? 
you know
Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data -- no Glenn Gould in the room. 
 just 
We've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well. 
well
  And that's just what the live audience did. 
 just 
But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. 
 just 
I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. 
 just 
Just think about that, you know? 
you know
And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, 'Forget the poor people. 
you know
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages. 
you know
And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey. 
you know
You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid. 
you know
And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school? 
 just 
Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money. 
you know
And I was so disappointed, and I was like, "Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?" 
you know
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are? 
you know
And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. 
you know
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know? 
you know
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know. 
you know
You know, so money ran out. 
you know
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me. 
you know
With pity, you know. Sadness. 
you know
You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know? 
you know
And I just wanted to personalize that. 
 just 
Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what? 
you know
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know? 
you know
And I was just moved. 
 just 
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!" 
you know
When you focus just on the disasters --   -- we're ignoring the potential. 
 just 
And this is an example, you know, blogging is one way of doing that. 
you know
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act. 
you know
The aid approach, you know, is flawed. 
you know
You know, just jump. 
you know
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know. 
you know
And because I'm needed here, you know? 
you know
But there is such a need, you know? 
you know
And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity. 
well
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting. 
 just 
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand. 
you know
You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. 
 just 
You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere. 
you know
We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know? 
you know
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference. 
 just 
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, "BBut it's not scalable, you know. 
you know
It's not that easy, you know? 
you know
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. 
 just 
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her. 
i mean
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her? 
well
You know, she's now my baby sister. 
you know
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don't normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded. 
 just 
And he was like, "Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States." 
you know
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out." 
you know
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school." 
 just 
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart, you have all these things going for you." 
you know
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh." 
you know
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me. 
you know
And he built me up, you know? 
you know
And this is just an illustration. 
 just 
We just need a push. 
 just 
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know? 
you know
You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave. 
you know
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know? 
you know
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move. 
you know
Now, a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. 
 just 
Or more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop? 
you know
 And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller, he's writing genomes that will work, we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does. 
you know
And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes, just so I don't scare you. 
 just 
And each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK? 
 just 
When you zoom in, they've got, you know, weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good. 
you know
 So, this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK? 
well
And what's really neat about it -- well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork, but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits. 
well
They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes, made a little switch, you see here, wired it up, tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. 
you see
Now, this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go. 
 just 
But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer. 
 just 
You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match. 
 just 
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32. 
 just 
And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations, and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it, as Feynman said, you know, we need to build something to understand it. 
you know
You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. 
you know
It's not just making about -- it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits. 
 just 
That's an in-joke, by the way. 
by the way
So the first question, and you might want to write this down, either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well. 
well
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it? Or would you just say, that's actually not possible? 
 just 
And if you can, just scribble a pattern. 
 just 
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate, but maybe not in this instance. 
you know
I passed them really well, but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground. 
well
And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way, it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on. 
by the way
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people -- we might as well get it right. 
well
Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse, have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?" 
well
Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer and we've got winter, and what -- does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night, and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields. 
i mean
We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else, and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look -- and scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models. 
well
And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed, there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional -- in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall," and said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't -- there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right, 
you know
And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it, they would have learned how it actually works, rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. 
you know
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well. 
well
Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling, as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after, that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching. 
you know
And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. 
well
OK? We collude, and actually if you -- if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams, to really understand, to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue, and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air, then I might have done better at science. 
 just 
Your homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift? 
you know
 Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement, it's just part of learning that's important. 
you know
Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on. 
 oh 
SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006, amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited. 
well
 Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. 
well
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs. 
you know
 Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer? 
 just 
E: [Squawks] SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier, but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem. 
well
 Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo. 
well
 SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous? 
i suppose
 Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in]. 
well
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy, a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere. 
you know
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska. 
you know
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber -- and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy, and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space. 
you know
You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now. 
you know
It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Union raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks, you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there, and while the probability is very small, the impact, figured in literally, of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking, searching, preparing to defend, is not unreasonable. 
you know
One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know. 
you know
In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know, just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward, in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us. 
you know
The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy -- we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes, you know, everything stored on our databases, and back them up off the planet, in case there would be one of those disastrous situations. 
you know
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today. 
you know
And I'd like to take you there, to that morning, for just a quick video. 
 just 
Well, people are going to die, how can you possibly going to put this forward?" 
well
By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin, is going to be about 200,000. 
you know
And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month. 
 just 
The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea. 
you know
And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas, and we just took on a new mission statement: "to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity." 
 just 
I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board. 
 just 
And that's huge. And then he turned around and said, "Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one." 
well
I said, "Well, that's great." 
well
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving, you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability. 
you know
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize, the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee, and you pay on success. 
you know
You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there, you know that when you're going for a goal, the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself. 
you know
Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule of -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work. 
you know
Well, it must be a good idea. 
well
Craig Venter has just joined our board and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him, we'll be announcing later this fall, about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine. 
 just 
Well, good morning. 
well
You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60, and today I'd like to talk about their relationship. 
you know
And it's not just what these are doing to each other, but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. 
 just 
And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you and what's not, and then tell me why. 
 just 
 Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs. 
well
By the way, this is about when I enter the picture. 
by the way
Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money. 
well
By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL, and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet. 
 just 
You know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world, about total transformation. 
you know
For 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking, you know, who else talks that way? 
you know
We promise something great, we evangelize it, we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well, and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again, as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment. 
well
I mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media? 
i mean
Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket. 
well
PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction, the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer, but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy, and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence. 
you know
PH: You know, that one computer was huge. 
you know
To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland, and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds. 
 just 
 Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set, you just get them out. 
 just 
PH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village. 
you know
You know, the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in. 
you know
And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations, it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do. 
 just 
The most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own HyperCard stacks. 
well
You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war on the content business. Find the commercial stuff, mash it up, tell the story your way. 
 just 
By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network. 
by the way
Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry, now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous. 
i mean
At stake: the battle for you, the consumer, and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America.  PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet, the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks. 
you know
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media. 
 just 
Well, you know where we're going on from here. 
well
To show you how schizophrenic this all is, here's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company, being asked, well, with the writers' strike, isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online? 
well
 Man: Yes, well, first, you know, I'm part of News Corporation as part of Fox Entertainment Group. 
well
For example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe, it's a network to hook its customers together. 
 just 
One of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis, who just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and -- rhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said about where songwriting's going. 
 just 
PH: So, to wrap up, I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan, who, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change, and I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before. 
 just 
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees. 
well
And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning. 
 just 
This is just one photograph from the air, and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe. 
 just 
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells. 
well
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. 
by the way
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American, we need three new planets. 
you know
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are, arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth, with this extraordinary brain, capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences, and yet we're destroying the only home we have. 
well
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. 
you know
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world. 
 just 
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term, in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect? 
well
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well. 
well
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife, domestic animals as well. 
well
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money, or just using them to feed their families, and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment, because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens. 
 just 
We have this program in prisons as well. 
well
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes. 
well
And I mean, think of the technologies. 
i mean
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines. 
 just 
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible. 
 just 
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us, and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park. 
well
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring. 
 just 
And we need some environmental role models as well, and I've been hearing some of them today. 
well
And just a last word on that -- the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today. 
 just 
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow. 
 just 
People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel. 
 just 
If you know about this trait, you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. 
you know
Once you understand this trait, you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know. 
you know
And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix." 
i mean
The best definition of innateness I've ever seen -- this just clarifies so many things for me -- is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. 
 just 
This Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule," and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course, as the foundation of so many religions. 
well
This painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity," but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. 
 just 
So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues. 
you see
I'll just flip through a few other slides. 
 just 
Well, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!" 
well
If you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers, for conservatives, well, loyalty is good -- dogs ought to be loyal. 
well
Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism? 
 just 
But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure, here's the same story, the same progression, told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago, in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. 
 just 
But they quickly see, "You know what, other people aren't doing so much though. 
you know
It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. 
 just 
Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip, you need some sort of punishment to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate. 
 just 
It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time, and you get the Grand Canyon. 
 just 
So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights." 
well
So once you see this -- once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute, that they form a balance on change versus stability -- then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix. 
you see
Well, if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions, and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology, I think you come to these conclusions: that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. 
well
But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in, saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right." 
 just 
Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right. 
 just 
And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are -- understand our moral psychology, understand that we all think we're right -- and then step out, even if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Seng-ts'an. 
 just 
So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails. 
 just 
There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology. 
 just 
Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea. 
you see
These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria. 
you see
You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out. 
you see
BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp? 
you see
DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. 
 just 
I just can't get over this -- that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. 
 just 
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way. 
by the way
 It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates. 
 just 
Although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years. 
well
DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well. 
well
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again, higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life. 
 just 
It's just like music -- it really is just like music. 
 just 
It's absurd. It's just absurd. 
 just 
But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 -- going forward, of course -- were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. 
 just 
So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things, just to jog your memories. 
 just 
If you're born after 1950, this is just -- consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane. 
 just 
 I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested, and I think this was seriously delusional. 
well
And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know, and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. 
well
It was just completely off the wall. 
 just 
It was just really, really frightening. 
 just 
So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. 
 just 
Well, you need about 75 pounds of it. 
well
This is not a product placement. It's just -- in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this --  -- but basically, this is it. 
 just 
Now this situation, already I -- you know, I don't really like thinking about this, although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very, very insecure in terms of developing this material. 
you know
Well, there's a lot of know-how out there. 
well
Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. 
well
I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community -- a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk, like better interdiction, better prevention, better fixing, you know, better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. 
you know
This is a 10-kiloton bomb, slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think -- "news you could use" kind of concept here. 
 just 
If you're right where the bomb went off, you will be vaporized. And that's -- I'm just telling you, this is not good. 
 just 
Well, if we're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack, you, up here, are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. 
well
You have, when the blast goes off -- and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it. 
by the way
In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do -- and I mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast. 
i mean
And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. 
 just 
You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud, I said, in just a few minutes. 
 just 
You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction, less destroyed here, then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way, as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. 
you know
And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard, and I just used some chalk on there. 
 just 
You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand, 105 degrees, one water bottle. 
 just 
And they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk." 
 just 
And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the States. 
by the way
So as we talked, Richard and I, I said, "You know, maybe I should bring a camel. 
you know
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. 
well
So not only do they have the very long eyelashes, but there's the secondary -- I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever. 
i guess
They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand. 
you know
I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants, you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!" 
you know
We're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well. 
well
Well, and you're glad I didn't show you this. 
well
That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream, and just whacker the entire area around him. 
 just 
Now, what you also didn't see was that -- and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki. 
by the way
Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate? 
well
But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel. 
 just 
I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs -- and I'm very well ... hung. 
well
 Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought, which is probably the most important thing to take away. 
 just 
And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference, not just this year, but in past years. 
 just 
But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting. 
 just 
And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website, the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type, just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this? 
 just 
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we? 
you know
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it? 
well
If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it? 
well
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes. 
well
And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte, so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word. 
you know
You know, is it worth trying to get there? 
you know
And we sort of said, well, how hard is this? 
well
This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services, for competing with the bookstore there. 
 just 
There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well. 
well
So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing. 
well
Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books. 
well
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them, because you could just buy another one, that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning. 
you know
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books -- about 300,000 now -- doing very well. 
well
And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well -- sort of these auto-page-turning things. 
well
And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage. 
you know
So all in all, that's going very well. 
well
And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world. 
 just 
Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs -- or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at. 
well
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. 
 just 
We tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies, which has just been great fun. 
 just 
Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web. 
well
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one, which is probably best known for burning, is, don't just have one copy. 
 just 
How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up? 
 just 
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure." 
well
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'" And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're going to use a microphone." 
well
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know -- old Cuban man from Camaguey. 
you know
 "After what I just told you?" 
 just 
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once -- to tell our story and have it heard. 
 just 
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch, came to the United States one thousand years ago. 
 just 
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now, he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go. 
you know
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue, and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport. 
well
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?" 
you know
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed, you know, that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit, you know, same color as the Buick. 
you know
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know. 
you know
"I guess I must." 
i guess
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door. 
 um
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert. 
i mean
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of birth breathing -- you know, that one? 
you know
"OK, so I stopped at a light and there's a guy, you know, in the back." 
you know
"No." She explained, "The man" -- I have to tell you as she did, because it loses something if I don't, you know -- "he come to the window, and he does a thing like this, which tells me he's pretty old, you know. 
you know
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.' Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps." 
well
 So he's talking to her, and at some point she says, "Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done." 
you know
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory, praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along, some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. 
you know
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking, that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren, this woman's mind. 
you know
But you know. 
you know
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child, the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly. 
you know
Well, I stood up to her. 
well
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding? 
you know
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us? 
 just 
You know, she eats small portions. 
you know
Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm. 
you know
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know. 
you know
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't." 
you know
People have pulled aside, I mean, they've come out of that queue line, they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. 
i mean
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there. 
 just 
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" -- they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!" 
well
I said, , and the young girl and the young boy say, "No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing." 
 just 
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK, because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon, you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly." 
you know
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God, she reminds us of our mother." 
i mean
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says, "You know what, honey?" 
you know
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids, or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school and tell them to learn, you know, learn what's in those schools. 
you know
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away, as oil hits its peak oil, you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should, or could, be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it. 
you know
You know, it doesn't work. 
you know
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed, but it's an issue in the food supply. 
you know
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT, but we know it wasn't good for you and me. 
okay
It really is just a new idea. 
 just 
I mean, people toss around sustainability, but we have to figure out what sustainability is. 
i mean
In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations, we've gone from being 200 -- being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers. 
you know
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals. 
you know
And if we continue down this path, if we continue to feed kids bad food, if we continue not to teach them what good food is, what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen? 
you know
Well, the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents. 
well
You know, we are responsible for what kids eat. 
you know
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago. 
well
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay. 
you know
Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken. 
well
You know, what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken? 
you know
You know, that vegetables are actually colorful, that they have flavor, that carrots grow in the ground, that strawberries grow in the ground. 
you know
You know, we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. 
you know
You know what? They're just going to be sick. 
you know
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people, very, very different, and I needed to market it. 
you know
And you see these recipes on the side? 
you see
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow, I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own. 
you know
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar, they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack. 
 just 
You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school. 
you know
Because, you know what, many of us are sort of at the end of our careers, and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids, the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet. 
you know
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. 
you know
And, you know, I'm not that better off now. 
you know
There was just a big study done, and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning. 
 just 
You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing. 
you know
And just remember, at very least tacitly, this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing. 
 just 
Okay, Finance 101 on this, and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece, because I think this is something we all have to understand. 
okay
So you know what, when we talk about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot. 
you know
One gourmet coffee, one, is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids You know what? We should be ashamed. 
you know
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids, whether you take your kids, or grandchildren, or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them. 
 just 
And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. 
 just 
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better." 
you know
And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas. 
 just 
And then I was an entertainer, I guess. 
i guess
You know, you think it's so cool, but they -- anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in. 
you know
They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool? 
you know
You know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh, and said, "Look, I can animate this." 
you know
And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego. 
you know
You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur? 
you know
You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist. 
you see
And every now and then, we do something like a, you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know, that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and -- and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out. 
you know
There's some kind of a blend that happens that allows, you know, to find innovation. 
you know
I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see. 
well
This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa, and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble. 
 just 
And this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear. 
you know
And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought. 
you know
And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell. 
you know
And then we said, well, you're going to feed him, and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated. 
well
And, you know, I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time. 
you know
Well, I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well. 
well
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic. 
 just 
 So right now, you see, I love little robots. 
you see
So my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will." 
well
This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know, my muse and my partner for eternity here. 
you know
She's an actual, you know, artist. 
you know
He didn't test so well, but I like him. 
well
And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why. 
well
 So, a little tether coming off, it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes. 
 just 
It's just a little server control and I made a little video going: "Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good," you know, and then I'd reach my hand. 
you know
And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time, said, "Yeah, we want to do this. 
i mean
We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair, and we're going to hire you guys to do this." 
you know
And they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them." 
well
And so we just had a disc of the files. 
 just 
And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars. 
you know
And I just a little bit on each one. 
 just 
Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff? 
you know
So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise up in Boise, on a river, you know. So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross, and we did Miracle Moves Baby, made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff. 
you know
We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet, won "Best Innovations" at CES, but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK, I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur, and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it, and then people started to want to do it. 
 just 
And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help. 
you know
And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here. 
 just 
And you can see we got a guy from -- who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us, down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything. 
 just 
So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that? 
you see
Yeah, they're like kids, you know. 
you know
You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry. 
okay
That's what the investors think, that it's just --  -- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys. 
 just 
And we're hoping that -- you know, our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human. 
you know
Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know. 
you know
Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet. 
you know
We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it. 
 just 
Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds. 
 just 
We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial, and they're going, "Whassup," you know? 
you know
And so I just -- I hope we all dream well. 
well
If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, "Well, what about thinking and emotions?" 
well
But thinking is really very straightforward: it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. 
 just 
Well, the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense. 
well
Okay, there're lots of problems to worry about. 
okay
Most people are about 60 inches high or more, and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big, by using nanotechnology, I suppose --  -- then you could have a thousand times as many. 
i suppose
You know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23 from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out, but -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people and you give them a scanner, or whatever you need, and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best, or she -- no reason to have just two sexes 
you know
any more, even. So each child has 46 parents, and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children. 
i suppose
And Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, "Well, that was wrong. 
well
Well, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter. 
well
You see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost, and nobody lives more than 120 years, for reasons that aren't very well understood. 
well
And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes, we can live 200 years. 
 just 
Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40, and I doubt that it's several hundred. 
 just 
So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. 
you know
You know, there's about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions. 
you know
And I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and --  -- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. 
i guess
So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian -- we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories, where you say, how do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is, after we go through a lot of levels, including designing a huge, messy system with thousands of ports, we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. 
you see
So, I think in the next 20 years, if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence, like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say, can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets; we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them. 
 just 
You can't just walk up and say, "Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl, and you should invest in me." Right? 
 just 
DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy! That's a straight line, look at that! 
 oh 
Experience: you've got to be able to say, "Hey, you know, I've done this before." 
you know
But, you know, not everybody has all these skills. 
you know
What else do you require? Well, leadership. 
well
Finally, you're asking for my money -- not just because it's my money, but because it's me. 
 just 
I want to know validation -- not just what you're telling me, but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense. 
 just 
But if you can do it, it works really well. 
well
But you know what? Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. 
you know
And you know what? 
you know
Best of all, images. Just a simple image. 
 just 
This is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences. 
you know
Or, "We sell services to help do X." You know, whatever. 
you know
I don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it? 
 just 
This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here. 
 just 
Then you take me back to just your logo on the screen. 
 just 
Well, I have a laptop in front of me. 
well
It lets you know exactly where you're going, helps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit. 
you know
Have you seen me touch the computer? No. Why not? 
you see
A year ago, I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing, that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. 
 just 
There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate, and some of them just come from common sense. 
 just 
If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a -- kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be, and that there are places out there where, supposedly, everything is the opposite to the way it is here. 
you know
Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random. 
well
Now, these aren't just differences in anatomy, like the shape of your ear lobes, but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams: "Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally." 
well
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota, they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes; both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee, both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists, both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after, and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. 
well
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. 
well
Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs. 
well
And just to make a long story short: first of all, the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. 
 just 
 Well, the book came out in October, and nothing terrible has happened. 
well
It's not clear, by the way, since then, whether that is an accurate generalization, but the data at the time seemed to support that. 
by the way
Well, pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters, death threats, ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals, coming from irate left-handers and their advocates, and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired. 
well
Well, the night is young, but the book has been out for half a year, and nothing terrible has happened. 
well
I'll just put that list up for a few seconds, and see if you can guess which two -- I would estimate that probably two of these topics of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews. 
 just 
Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline. 
well
Well, here's a diagnosis. 
well
And here's just one example. 
 just 
I mean, this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century; here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century. 
i mean
 Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement. 
 just 
By the way, this is one sentence -- you can actually parse it. 
by the way
Well, the argument in "The Blank Slate" was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century, although not the arts in general, have disdained beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight and style. 
well
Well, this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. 
well
Well, the other hot button is parenting. 
well
Well, here's some sobering facts about parenting. 
well
Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together? 
well
You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar, because not only would they share their genes, but they would also share their environment. 
well
So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices. 
 just 
And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years, are they going to be everywhere sooner than that? 
well
And you know, the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong, a little microprocessor embedded, and then other games that came after that. 
you know
And just as in the early days, when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers, you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books. 
 just 
But at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale. 
you see
And let me just show you that. 
 just 
And it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles. 
 just 
 We'll just put some crap here. 
 just 
 Okay. 
okay
 I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up. 
you see
Okay, so it's doing local navigation there. 
okay
Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile, things were just too -- there was nothing left to do. 
 just 
Okay, good. 
okay
And over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. 
well
And I want to actually use a robot here -- a robot named Chris -- stand up. Yeah. Okay. 
okay
He sort of does that. But I'm going to -- Chris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh. 
 just 
 Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good. 
okay
I just want to show you one technical diagram here. 
 just 
It was just saying random English phonemes. 
 just 
 And on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here -- where in each of these cases, the robots want more respect. 
you know
Well, do you ever need to give robots respect? 
well
They're just machines, after all. 
 just 
But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines. 
you know
You don't see a description of how, you know, Molecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule. 
you know
And it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges, and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. 
you know
If we are machines, then in principle at least, we should be able to build machines out of other stuff, which are just as alive as we are. 
 just 
And to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us. 
you know
We don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know, having the idea that robots could really have emotions, or that robots could be living creatures -- I think is going to be hard for us to accept. 
you know
And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like. 
you know
And the question is, you know, will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us? 
you know
And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard, you know -- "I accidentally built a 747." 
you know
We'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot. 
you know
 And we're just not going to let it go that way. 
 just 
It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street, it says, "does not make me happy." 
 just 
We had a show that just came down last week in New York. 
 just 
Here's what I mean. Politics and -- let's focus on the political system in particular question here, which is the system of democracy. 
i mean
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense. 
well
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace." 
you know
Well, so says George W. Bush. 
well
Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks. 
well
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. 
well
Because they would have done extraordinarily well. 
well
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States. 
well
It will be transformative of Islam as well. 
well
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens, it cannot be the right strategy, either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war, "Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out, because we opposed the war in the first place." 
well
Well, what I'm here to say then is, for people who are skeptical about the war, it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. 
well
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose -- just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud. 
 just 
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure. 
 just 
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field, and it sits on just four very delicate columns. 
 just 
The public, you know, once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar. 
you know
So, all the waters of the world are served there, so we thought that, you know, after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water, you could also drink this building. 
you know
And so it is sort of a theme, but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that. 
you know
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell, because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know, 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?" 
well
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them. 
well
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. 
you know
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective, and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. 
 just 
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know, the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with. 
you know
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself, and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall. 
by the way
So, what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there. 
you see
And what you see is -- actually, the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element, which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the -- which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around, cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage. 
you see
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain. 
by the way
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building, but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site -- you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston -- and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum. 
you know
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit. 
i mean
The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light, and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. 
 just 
This was eliminated because the view was too good, and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open." 
 just 
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. 
 just 
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis. 
 just 
And for the purposes of this talk, I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects, and it happens to be our current obsession, and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction. 
 just 
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started. 
 just 
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped. 
 just 
Before and after shot.  Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go. 
 just 
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself, which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. 
 just 
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage. 
 just 
 And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing, but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin, very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier, the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage. 
 just 
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military, but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. 
to be honest
Actually I'm just going to pause for one second, because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED -- you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. 
 just 
I just want to get that out of the way. 
 just 
 And -- you see the picture at the bottom? 
you see
The graphics were just horrible. 
 just 
Well, obviously it's for children, right? 
well
Well, no, actually it's 30 years old. 
well
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever, so it's just not true. 
 just 
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer, making the publisher about another 275 million. 
 just 
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data. 
 just 
I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items. 
 just 
This is happening in your local cities too, you're probably just not aware of it. 
 just 
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving. 
 just 
 With the combination of simple, interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. 
 just 
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. 
 just 
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap, a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life. 
 just 
A well-designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. 
well
No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game. 
 just 
Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply TVs. 
 just 
There is a potential to do good as well. 
well
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well. 
well
DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. 
 just 
 DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class. 
 just 
You know, we have the technology. 
you know
She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. 
 just 
I just hope she likes video games. 
 just 
 And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. 
 just 
And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density -- I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call. 
well
There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day, as it was for about a week after, and the West Village had never seemed more lively. 
you know
And I thought, well, this is the power of a city. 
well
I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there, was destroyed by the attacks, and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. 
you know
But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later, the city had never looked more alive. 
 just 
If you'd gone into the minds of the people, well, you would have seen a lot of trauma, and you would have seen a lot of heartache, and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover. 
well
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well, and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now. 
well
Well, there are some kind of executive decisions, but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody. 
well
Well, it was the whole city. 
well
So it's been a very optimistic time, I think, and I want to just talk about a few of those things. 
 just 
That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. 
you know
 And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this, but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing. 
you know
It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. 
 just 
Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. 
 just 
This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web, and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place. 
 just 
Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this. 
well
Well, something like Technorati is supplying that. 
well
He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there. 
you know
And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus." 
 just 
Well, you know, we should expect to see that. 
well
 I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish. 
 just 
And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel, I think, right there. 
by the way
It just came out. This is bursty words, looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. 
 just 
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere, so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off, that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. 
you know
That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting. 
you know
And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious. 
well
So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those. 
you know
You know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do," but with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language. 
you know
It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs, and a long tail of blogs with very few links. 
well
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on, literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece -- was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. 
 just 
But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion -- but followed by other cultures as well -- that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life, you could live on in the memory of others. 
well
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now, but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived." 
 just 
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?" 
well
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington." 
well
Now, when you're only six years old, and your father comes home every single night and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail, recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon. 
 just 
The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella, came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island, just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion. 
 just 
 Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s, before I had gotten married and had my three sons, I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys. 
well
Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families, and the public figures we have respected in our history, just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe, really can live on, so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives. 
 just 
Let's just get started here. 
 just 
Okay, just a moment. 
 just 
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today, because today as well, there are some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia. 
well
Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses, you know right away that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject. 
you know
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework, the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse, the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation, which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron. 
well
Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse, with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well? 
well
In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different -- they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies 
 just 
are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific, of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation? 
well
Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years, and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water, of soil, of climate change, invasive species, the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. -- listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs -- 
well
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies, at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers. 
well
Whereas the personal income, on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation, But you find essentially the same results, namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level -- increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are. 
well
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks, and as he does that, he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination. 
 just 
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man is, he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels, or his problems at home. 
well
His body disappears, his identity disappears from his consciousness, because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do, to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration, and at the same time to feel that he exists. 
well
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder, because I can't compose.  So what it's telling you here is that obviously this automatic, spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique. 
well
Now, when that happens, he says the music just flows out. 
 just 
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. 
you see
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. 
you see
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say, you can't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job. 
 just 
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense, leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity: you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other; you get immediate feedback. 
you know
You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger. 
you know
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be, but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill. 
 just 
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance, or destiny, or what? 
 just 
These corals can be quite kind of mean, you see, and I have surfing scars to prove that. 
you see
That he was in all these other locations as well, but experiencing them as separate individuals. 
well
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral. 
 just 
These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton. 
 just 
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty. 
 just 
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful, and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles, each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape. 
 just 
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern -- well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory. 
well
Well, pretty bad. 
well
I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...? 
i mean
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. 
well
GL: Well, as far as we know electrons are point particles, so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales. 
well
And that's because there's some little bit of fear, little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. 
 just 
Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know, we really need, we really cherish and we really work on. 
you know
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers, just like designers are seeking scientists. 
 just 
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant. 
you know
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now, just to give you a taste of it. 
 just 
He's thinking -- of course it's all a concept -- of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa, I don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation.  I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know. 
you know
You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. 
you know
Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat -- of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker, but you know, in the future it could be made better -- which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find. 
you know
Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally. 
you know
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know, as anything in our life today, we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints, and at different levels. 
you know
You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" -- the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. 
you see
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair, but you know what? One day it will take seven hours. 
you know
And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home, customize your chair. You know, companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity. 
you know
And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine -- you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much -- that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer and print your own basketball. 
you know
This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping. 
 just 
So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life. 
 just 
These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory So instead of having only the pictures, you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have, you know, Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive. 
you know
So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death, they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them, and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever. 
you know
You see, this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell, New Mexico. 
well
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies, Sasquatch, God, the possibility of love -- and thereafter, as you know, Enrico Fermi ate alone. 
you know
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned, just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. 
 just 
 But it was also the tone of how she asked the question: apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer, as though she just wanted to talk to me. 
 just 
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course, always wears a tuxedo. 
you know
Well, it's certainly not this one. 
well
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe, grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene -- he has other kinds of glamour. 
by the way
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary. 
well
Well of course, in the 20th century, glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. 
well
There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization," and it's not just the case for people. 
 just 
So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous. 
you know
The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough. 
you know
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period, but because, in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday. 
 just 
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality. 
you know
Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat -- you just see the possibilities. 
 just 
You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural. 
 just 
The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this -- I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world. 
you know
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie. 
 just 
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time. 
you know
You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like. 
you know
I mean, there's no paper on the desk. 
i mean
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too. 
i mean
You know, we're marching toward Utopia. 
you know
And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor. 
 just 
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology. 
you know
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid, even though she thought she could look stupid. 
you know
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine. 
 just 
I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn’t have before, and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet, but that happiness is not -- we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom," when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people, 
 just 
But rather all of these different practices -- you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn’t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. 
you know
You know, when most people think about the diet I recommend, they think it’s a really strict diet. 
you know
For reversing disease, that’s what it takes, but if you’re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices. 
 just 
Now I thought, you know, if we just did good science, that would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive. 
you know
Well, because it helps them get through the day. 
well
And I’ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression. 
 just 
Many of you have kids, and you know that’s a big change in your lifestyle, and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they’re worth it. 
you know
And just to show you this, this is from the CDC. 
 just 
And if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 -- you get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001. 
you see
Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ... 
well
You know, I don’t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day, and so I just thought I’d spend a few minutes on that. 
you know
It’s not just what you exclude from your diet, but also what you include that’s protective. 
 just 
Three grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules; more than that just gives you extra fat you don’t need. 
 just 
Now, the problem with the Atkins diet, everybody knows people who have lost weight on it, but you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen. 
you know
So, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. 
 just 
And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship, just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. 
 just 
I then wondered, well, maybe they’re just changing their PSA, but it’s not really affecting the tumor growth. 
well
So, if it’s true for prostate cancer, it’ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. 
well
It can be sexual intimacy – I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. 
 just 
One group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group. 
 just 
They just met once a week for a year. 
 just 
Other studies have shown this as well. 
well
And at the end of it, somebody said, "Hey, Swami, what’s the difference between wellness and illness?" 
well
And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word "illness," and circled the first letter, and then wrote the word "wellness," and circled the first two letters ... 
well
To me, it’s just shorthand for what we’re talking about: that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. 
 just 
Well, it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure: it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. 
well
What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets -- versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just -- these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc., in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance? 
 just 
You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle -- that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over. 
you see
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density of information, but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology -- computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve, and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. 
 just 
It's just going up through the roof. 
 just 
The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual -- and whatever else we devote ourselves to. 
 just 
Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. 
 just 
Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute, put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii, and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to 71,530 feet -- higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. 
 just 
It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there. 
 just 
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii. 
 just 
In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams, his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces -- that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it, 
 just 
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're -- all right -- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees. 
you see
And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month, showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour with just a little battery in it. 
 just 
There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. 
 just 
In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. 
 just 
The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. 
 just 
Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush. 
well
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there, but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. 
 just 
So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something. 
 just 
We can probably get it down, but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --  -- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --  just --  But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous; there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago -- 
 just 
Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute, just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa? 
 just 
CA: Just -- KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer. 
 just 
It was just frightening. 
 just 
It's not considered vintage -- she just likes certain music to sound a certain way. 
 just 
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle at the ocean. 
 just 
She just says, "No thank you." 
 just 
You know? 
you know
We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected, it changes our understanding of the way things work. 
 just 
You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet, and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. 
you know
KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is. 
you see
And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know, we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in, and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on. 
you know
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good. 
 just 
And as we thought about it more, we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience, just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future. 
 just 
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is. 
you know
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work. 
 just 
 Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly. 
you see
In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal: so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag. 
 just 
 ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. 
 just 
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect. 
 just 
KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing. 
you see
You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on, based on the curvature of the pages. 
you see
Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good. 
 oh 
But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect, then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor. 
you know
ZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself, and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible, beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies. 
 just 
And he kind of comically explained that time after time, what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go. 
 ok 
 I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries. 
i mean
And you know, his son was mesmerized, because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. 
you know
 I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me. 
i mean
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this, feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti, who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know, studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce? 
you know
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything -- just in a reduced, small version. 
 just 
I love her, you know. 
you know
You’re just too blind to see it now. 
 just 
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just -- Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky. 
 just 
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean. 
you know
Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now. 
 just 
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse. 
 just 
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through. 
you know
And so it’s really -- it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997, which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship, the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history. 
you know
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated. 
 just 
And what would a child -- what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think, I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him? 
i mean
What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well, France is a liberal society." 
well
I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me. 
i suppose
You know what you are? A crocodile. 
you know
Well done, well done. 
well
 NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here, is that while we’re making all these huge advancements, what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should -- Africa should move forward, but we should remember, so we do not go back here again. 
you know
 One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers. 
 just 
But I’m just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement. 
 just 
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage. 
well
Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite -- his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know." 
you know
Well, it’s the relative importance. 
well
But it’s a question of perception, and if that’s what you’re thinking, if that’s what you think I mean when I say, "This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'" If you think that that’s the relative importance, two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten. 
i mean
The problem we have in believing that is -- you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. 
 just 
If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet, it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks. 
 just 
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it. 
 just 
I don’t know of any other submersible, or even remote, that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space. 
 just 
Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray. 
 just 
And just notice how she rolls under and turns; she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls. 
 just 
Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away. 
 just 
She just rolled right away from underneath. 
 just 
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. 
 just 
I just had to go and build another machine. 
 just 
But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it, it’s a little bit of back pressure, and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water. 
 just 
I don’t really look that ugly, but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted. 
 just 
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head. 
 just 
"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about, oh, I don’t know, just so close." 
 just 
We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now." 
 just 
Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please. 
okay
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces. 
 just 
You see the larger wing area here. 
you see
We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go. 
 just 
It just seems wrong to try and patent --  -- the freedom for underwater flight. 
 just 
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo. 
well
Having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us. 
 just 
One from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well. 
well
And, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami, what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists, who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories. 
you know
You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds." 
you know
There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers, but for the most part the group's guess would be better than just about all of you. 
 just 
You know, if you think about something like Google, which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that, and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing we call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order, or a remarkable intelligence in it. 
you know
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there, and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. 
 just 
A network is not just the product of its component parts. 
 just 
So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme, once an idea gets going, it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on, because other people have, say, a link. 
 just 
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature. 
you know
But we know that occasionally ants go astray, and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost, they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does. 
 just 
And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long and lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died. 
 just 
That's the thing we have to fear -- is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die. 
 just 
And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed. 
you know
Well, I want to take you on this journey. 
well
And so when I came in and I started walking around, people -- they just knew what was going on. 
 just 
And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment." 
well
And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest. 
 just 
Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening, was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say, and so I stopped listening. 
 just 
And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back, while they were still finishing up. 
 just 
Well, that just ended communication. 
well
Well, that lasted 17 years. 
well
I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying. 
you know
And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher and you were teaching, if you weren’t learning you probably weren’t teaching very well. 
well
My dad came out to see me graduate and, you know, I did the deal, and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... " You know what went on, he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. 
you know
He said, "I don't know how you do this, son -- I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don’t talk. 
i mean
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone, because you seem to be doing a lot better when you’re not saying anything." 
you see
 Well, I put on my backpack again. 
well
Well, my journey kept going on. 
well
I wrote regulations for the United States -- I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations. 
i mean
He said, "You just start walking east; get out of your car and just start walking east." 
 just 
Well, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time. 
well
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. 
 just 
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message." 
well
But the thing that was different was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence, but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet. 
 just 
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me, and that I was going to have to change. 
 just 
You know, we can do it. 
you know
And I was afraid to change, because I was so used to the guy who only just walked. 
 just 
And he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor, very quickly, just as quickly as they could. 
 just 
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it. 
 just 
Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence. 
 just 
But before we start, I need just to put these on. 
 just 
So the way they work is, you know, you just put your finger in the thing, pull them back, and off you go. 
you know
 Well, they’re still coming in from the back there; they’re still coming in. 
well
Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better... 
i suppose
So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know. 
you know
Why do we have them? Well, as I said, we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. 
well
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest. 
to be honest
Now, an adult encountering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know. 
you know
One of them might be, you know, when we see this funny stripy thing: is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us? 
you know
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree? 
 just 
Well, at least, we did once. 
well
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose. 
i suppose
Well, not necessarily. 
well
And you know, the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. 
you know
And you know, from an exploration perspective, this behavior makes complete sense. 
you know
I want you to do as many of them as you can, in the minute that I’m just about to give you. 
 just 
Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say. 
okay
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. 
 just 
So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things, even if they don’t seem that different from each other, is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play. 
well
For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well. 
well
It’s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do. 
 just 
I mean, can you have rules about creativity? 
i mean
Well, it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process. 
well
And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said, well, I want to hold it like this, or like that. 
well
The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. 
i mean
And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way. 
 just 
But you know, many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play. 
you know
Some of it’s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don’t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid. 
 just 
They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying, you know, "That’s just happening because they’re acting it out." 
you know
And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see, and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play, just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes. 
 just 
This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian, and he’s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient. 
 er 
 And also, the amazing thing about this video -- as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience. 
you see
And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty while you’re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck’s going on. 
you know
So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know, he’s beginning to try on that identity. 
you know
And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway. 
you know
Not just because they lead to insights about the experience, but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience. 
 just 
And so far, I admit, this might feel like it’s a message just to go out and play like a kid. 
 just 
Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub. 
well
But there aren’t just rules about how to play; there are rules about when to play. 
 just 
These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of. 
 just 
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories. 
well
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know, the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell. 
you know
And my definition of a theory is, it’s not just something that you teach people; it’s labor saving. 
 just 
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. 
well
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know, if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs. 
you know
If it didn’t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things. 
well
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature, there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them. 
well
In other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense, just a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling. 
 just 
You need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right, OK? So you can try a thousand molecules, you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend, and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one. 
you know
So nobody likes particularly to -- you know, aftershave with carcinogens. 
you know
Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said, look, I’ve just found this such a beautiful reaction, that even if this compound doesn’t smell of coumarin, I want to do it, it’s just such a nifty, one step -- I mean, chemists have weird minds -- one step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely crystalline compound. Let us try it. 
you know
You see, when you’re a scientist, you’re always selling ideas. 
you see
And I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know -- there’s three attitudes: You’re right, and I don’t know why, which is the most rational one at this point. 
well
But for the last three years, I’ve had what I consider to be the best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby -- which is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things -- plus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works. 
you know
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well. 
well
And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do. 
by the way
Well, my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics. 
well
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide, you know, whether I’m right or somebody else is right, in 30 and 50 years. 
you know
There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK? 
 just 
Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. 
 just 
So in such a relational universe, if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured, like this device here, or that device there, or something beautiful, like all the living things, all of you guys in the room -- "guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women. 
by the way
Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda. 
 just 
The phones just aren't ringing about the people." 
 just 
I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally, appropriately, interestingly. 
i mean
They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number -- this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. 
i mean
So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide; what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me. 
 just 
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly. 
 just 
I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those -- well, I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go, we're going to set up camps, and we're going to supply humanitarian aid. 
well
Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves. 
well
Well, if you denounce, you're probably never going to get back in the room. 
well
Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing? 
you see
He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them. 
 just 
At a macro level, he thought, you know, we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity. 
you know
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was. 
i mean
And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know. 
you know
 And sometimes -- actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post, that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever, but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on. 
 just 
And I took a picture of his shoes, and we thanked each other and just went on our way. 
 just 
Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there, so many clothes out there. 
you know
Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn, there was actually someone thought of that thought already. 
 oh 
This woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine, and she came backstage and she said, oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism and talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia. 
you know
I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know, he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know, you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know? 
you know
So I don't really know that. I don't really -- actually I do my own kind of research, you know. 
you know
And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you. 
 just 
And I think about, you know, their roles, and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at. 
you know
Whether they're kind of glorified in this way, or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified, or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated. 
you know
It's rarely color that I find in nature, although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color, natural color is so beautiful. 
you know
I mean, that's just not possible, you know. 
you know
And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know. 
you know
So, you know, for years I would go to bars and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately, or something. 
you know
 And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!" 
you know
The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right? 
you know
And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other. 
you know
You know, homosexuality, right? 
you know
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know. 
you know
And at least, you know, in my case, because if I just do one thing all the time, I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily. 
you know
And you know, I don't say that I do everything well, I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all. 
well
And I kind of try not to look back, you know. 
you know
Like, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know. 
you know
But I guess that's okay. Right? 
i guess
Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything, and not just one, you know. 
you know
It's just that. 
 just 
Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that's so ... somehow, like, about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio, like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show. 
you know
IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back. 
 just 
I don't want to be -- okay. Here we go. 
okay
IM: You look so cute already, by the way. 
by the way
IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know, aggressively ugly. 
you know
Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous, does that mean you shouldn't have kids, because you know they're going to end up getting messed up? 
you know
ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first, I think. 
well
A: Oh no, we're just staging, ROD: We're just staging it. 
 oh 
IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right. 
by the way
I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that. 
i mean
Right? And then I realized, that was on my website, and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview. 
you know
Then how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something. 
you know
And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows? 
 just 
And again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right? 
 just 
IM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny. 
you know
Chef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal. 
well
In the old days when they used to make butter, you know how you make butter? 
you know
Well, that's it. Thank you very much. 
well
Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now. 
well
Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then, hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there. 
well
So, that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break, you know, in here. 
you know
Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else, and go do something different, you know, and doing that. 
you know
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office, and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead. 
you know
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets, but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know. 
you know
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago. 
you know
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago, after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite, and that's the one you see on the left in there. 
you see
And that was done over a period of a couple of years, and now we are the leading organization, you know, exploring space on all of your behalf. 
you know
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward; somehow it ended going sideways. 
you see
But then also, just to celebrate that, we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile." 
 just 
It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it; I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days. 
well
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know, when we entered one of the floats. 
you know
That's more on the play side. And on the right side, that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it. 
 just 
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things, you know, and the serious things that we try to do. 
you know
Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do. 
 just 
Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple. 
well
You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see, all that life that you see around you, and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here. 
you see
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there. 
you know
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller, but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth, you know, if you don't take the oceans into account. 
you know
So it's about the size, you know, of the United States. 
you know
And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is, relative to Mount Everest. 
you know
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth. 
you know
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot. 
you see
And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon, and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers. 
you see
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know, the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down, you know, that canyon. 
you know
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down -- or that Rover -- and made sure that it's all working well. 
well
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working. 
well
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on, but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last 90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered, and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm. 
you know
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart, but every once in a while it's good to be lucky. 
well
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here, and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up. 
 just 
And now we designed them reasonably well, but that's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data. 
well
You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working, one of the front wheels, so what we are doing, we are driving it backwards. 
you know
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited, you know, outside the science community about these Rovers, so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community. 
you know
By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know, about four years ago. 
you know
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned. 
okay
Okay, deploy the airbags. Open. 
okay
As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth, so you see sand dunes. 
you see
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole, because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada. 
you know
So, we wanted to find out, actually, what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it some organic, you know, material. 
you know
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet. 
 just 
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars, but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know, in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of, a little bit of what's going to happen. 
you know
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart. 
 just 
So it will be a very tense moment, you know, as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet. 
you know
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know, an efficient kind of machine. 
you know
And we really love being close to the art center, because we have, as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center, Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays, far-out displays, you know, in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room, just to get people to think wildly about things. 
you know
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation, you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor. 
you know
So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work. 
 just 
So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know, that we have to face. 
you know
You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day, you know, if that happened, so we have to test, because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds. 
you know
Next step, we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL, in what we call our Mars Yard. 
you know
We kick them, we hit them, we drop them, just to make sure we understand how, where would they break. 
 just 
And then we back off, you know, from that point. 
you know
That big shield that you see outside, that's a heat shield which is going to protect it. 
you see
And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags. 
well
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know, mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass. 
you know
Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way. 
you know
So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real. 
you know
And also to help you, to help the community so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails, you know, also on Mars. 
you know
So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know, fun things we are doing on Mars. 
you know
One, it's a very attractive planet -- it just has the beauty of the rings and so on. 
 just 
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed, that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun, a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together, and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets, you know, were formed. 
you know
By the way, all of this is real stuff. 
by the way
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings, which are the particles. 
you see
So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know, is being formed in that location. 
you know
Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting. 
well
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet, which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know, below the surface. 
you know
And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers which are being, you know, emitted from it. 
you know
That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well. 
well
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn, we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements. 
you know
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast, and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island, and that looks like an ocean. 
you see
So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know, because water would have frozen. 
you know
You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it, and you've got your car filled up. 
 just 
And just to kind of put us in perspective, this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun. 
 just 
There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well, but on the top left, around 10 o'clock, there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth. 
well
So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know, just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center. 
you know
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language, and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make. 
i mean
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all. 
i mean
I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --  Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better. 
you know
So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term. 
i mean
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years, and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long. 
 just 
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy. 
you know
We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --  -- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something. 
i mean
 We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original: 17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares. 
 just 
So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners. 
 just 
I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space. 
you see
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this, I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works, because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland. 
 just 
 I'll just quote from the specification. 
 just 
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser. 
well
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people, that's why these patents are sometimes necessary. 
 just 
And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me. 
i mean
And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict. 
i mean
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title. 
i mean
 Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --  Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad. 
i mean
You know, there is a --  I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this. 
you know
And you know, there you had this little sign -- I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read, "Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here. 
you know
 OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you. 
i mean
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans. 
 just 
Here I just brought it back to its original state. 
 just 
 But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know -- Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art. 
you know
You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea: it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it. 
you see
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway. 
i mean
I mean, it's "the future we will create." 
i mean
 But to round things up I would like to show you just one more. 
 just 
 I just piled them up. 
 just 
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack. 
 just 
 Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly, so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler. 
 just 
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know, next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years -- basically civilization's story so far. 
you know
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period. 
i suppose
And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. 
 just 
Well, this was the first solution. 
well
You don't want just any mountain. 
 just 
In this case it might well be an image of the clock. 
well
Something that's just yours. 
 just 
People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true. 
 just 
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars. 
well
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line, due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that, as you'll see when we go inside in a minute, we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. 
 just 
Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain. 
by the way
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington. 
you see
As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington, just a few old mining roads like this, so you have to bushwhack everywhere. 
 just 
Well, here's a potential approach. 
well
Now, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director. 
you know
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there, and that brings it out. 
you see
Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs, it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot, there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq. 
 just 
And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble. 
well
In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air. 
well
and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell. 
well
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words, a few things about my personal life, because I think there is a connection. 
 just 
Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer, and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor, who is a veteran of National Geographic, and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa, I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun." 
you know
So I guess it's a world premier. 
i guess
Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here. 
 just 
I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood. 
i mean
I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality, but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films. 
i mean
Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world. 
 just 
Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant. 
 just 
It’s not just what you see in picture. 
you see
You see the person live. 
you see
You see how he talks. You see how he lives. 
you see
He influences you really good, you know. 
you know
It’s not just what you see in the picture. 
you see
Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies. 
you know
And I didn't want that, you know. 
you know
Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there, but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out. 
you see
Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face. 
 just 
Wat, wait. Just hold this for me. 
 just 
KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know. 
well
You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives. 
you know
I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you. 
 just 
I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers, and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe. 
you know
It’s technology. I’m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know, the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. 
you know
It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood. 
 just 
FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important. 
 oh 
Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this, these are films that are distributed directly in markets. 
you know
They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology. 
you know
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs. 
you know
And so one of the questions that I asked you is, when you look around, what do you see? 
you see
Well, you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people, but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here, being reshaped in a certain form. 
well
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy, which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's an art design college conference going on, and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know, what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from, and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here. 
you know
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know, what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that? 
you know
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it. 
you see
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres, just because that's where we're making observations. 
 just 
I mean, it just gives you the scale. 
 just 
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way, and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies, and there's a sphere that marks the different times. 
you know
You see the whole big picture? 
you see
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside, and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang, which is actually incredibly uniform. 
you see
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space, and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean. 
 just 
And just put radially they're going out that way. 
 just 
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall, but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. 
you see
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky? 
you see
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies, you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure. 
you know
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall, and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids. 
you see
But you can see the voids, you can see the complicated structure, and you say, well, how did this happen? 
well
It's not just throwing them out at random. 
 just 
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially, some of the play principles and some of the design principles that, you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up, but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. 
you know
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time, develops into this complicated structure. 
 just 
You see how the filament -- you see how several filaments are coming together, therefore making this supercluster of galaxies. 
you see
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe in a very simple way? 
you know
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one. 
 just 
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it. 
 just 
And you see how the dark matter lumps up, and the ordinary matter just trails along behind. 
you see
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000, and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in. 
 just 
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see, and then only things that have started forming already are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on. 
 just 
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before. 
you know
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out all the major continents, but that's about it. 
well
But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there, where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth. 
you see
You can see that just from the map alone. 
 just 
You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to, and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine -- they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around. 
well
If people want to use it in their labs for working on research, just reconstruct it yourself, because, you know, it might break in FedEx. 
you know
So the solution has to be, as people like Russell and Einstein in a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century, that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart. 
 just 
You know, public policy and moral progress. 
you know
And you know, and the troubling thing is that it's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things, so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage. 
you know
It was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose, a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books. 
i suppose
And I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called me to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore because, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on. 
you know
Things where, you know, a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome. 
you know
Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction, which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement in what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms, if something costs about 1,000 dollars today, say, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost, I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay? 
okay
Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education. 
 just 
The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface, we just didn't know how to do it at the time. 
 just 
So given that we know and should believe -- because Moore's Law's been, like, a constant, I mean, it's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever. 
 just 
If we take carbon nanotubes, you know, Iijima discovered them in 1991, they just have incredible properties. 
you know
They conduct heat along their length but not across -- well, there is no width, but not in the other direction if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also. 
well
And we've dedicated -- we've just raised a new fund, we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments. 
 just 
The third area that we're working on, and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York. 
 just 
And so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here, he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep, because there's so many great technologies out there, we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know. 
you know
We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals. 
well
Well, you have to hold people accountable. 
well
It's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember, you know, Galileo essentially locked up, and who are still fighting this battle against the church. 
you know
I mean, it's crucified. 
i mean
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York. 
 just 
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding. 
 just 
 I mean, I love the stuff. 
i mean
You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage, and that's what you get when you want foie gras. 
you know
He's really just in love with -- he's at one with -- he's the goose whisperer. 
 just 
 And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought, like I'm speaking to you now, right, but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions, because the more I got to know him and his system, the more exciting this whole idea became. 
you know
I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever, so you know, I slowed down. 
you know
And finally, by the end of the day I was like, Ed-uar-do, you know like this? 
you know
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese -- and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this -- the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks. 
 just 
I mean, his farm is incredible. 
i mean
Well, because he doesn't force feed, because he doesn't gavage tons of corn, his livers were pretty grey. 
well
 So I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like, is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up? 
you know
Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything, and it was always nature. 
you know
And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like, weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves. 
you know
And the problem with saying that, of course, is that you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily. 
you know
I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much, he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like, this guy's a genius, you know? 
you know
And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise. 
you know
And I'm not like some super taster, you know? 
you know
I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it. 
you know
I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out. 
 just 
And he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round. 
 just 
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well: to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements. 
well
 Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. 
you know
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050. 
well
Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein, which suggests that the approach might be a general one, and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases, not just Alzheimer’s disease. 
 just 
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease, well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease. 
well
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma, which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye. 
 just 
And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay? 
okay
The largest individuals of this species, the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California, where the rain is really intense. 
 just 
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast, and was discovered in 1998. 
well
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them, using the so-called arborist climbing technique, with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree. 
 just 
She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall. 
by the way
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you -- everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar. 
you see
Flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time. 
 just 
If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just, you know, extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off. 
you know
But as you go and you look closer at a tree, what you see is, you see increasing complexity. 
you see
And what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the Eastern Hemlock species -- that is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite -- but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns. 
 just 
One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all, and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. 
 just 
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time. 
well
We don't know what it is -- we just know it's there. 
 just 
CA: So, you have to wonder when, you know, if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth, you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip. 
you know
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening, and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever. 
 just 
It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me, and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is. 
 just 
RP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases -- parasites that move into the human species. 
you know
But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide, all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself -- CA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently. 
you know
You know, we're going to do things a little differently. 
you know
And at the same time, we're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that -- snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating. 
 just 
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. 
you see
I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this, and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions. 
 just 
You know, I guess the first question is, why build a virtual world at all? 
you know
And I think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project, you know. 
you know
So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing. 
 just 
I was just always trying to make things. 
 just 
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things, and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else. 
 just 
And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to -- but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened, like on Star Trek. 
you know
I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight, and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling. 
you know
And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just, you know, just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers, I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers 
you know
I just wanted this place where you could build things. 
 just 
And so I think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important. 
you see
Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible. 
 just 
You know, another way to look at that, is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space. 
you know
I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies -- you know, it's this dream that we all share. 
you know
In some sense, you would become someone else in that journey, because there wouldn't be -- you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind. 
you know
You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know, comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of -- and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s. 
you know
We always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life" with "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet." 
 just 
You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can't. 
you know
Second Life today is this 20,000 machines, and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know, an object would be something like this, possibly interactive. 
you know
The first is that, as I said, the -- well, the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings. 
well
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know, that 3D, that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us. 
you know
You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you, and ask them, "Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it." 
you see
That experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example, is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way. 
 just 
Asking for advice, rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map. 
 just 
So let me stop there and bring John back, and maybe we can just have a longer conversation. 
 just 
You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that, you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or, is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it, that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it? 
you know
Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody, even if you mean well when you build them. 
well
And what's more, human society, when it's controlled, when you set out a grand scheme of rules, a new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever, that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond, you know -- I always laughingly say -- the Mall of America, you know, which is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture that, you know, has been built. 
you know
It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat. 
 just 
I just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design. 
 just 
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective, and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately -- I think we've now turned it off, if I remember. 
 just 
But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this, which is great relative to the utopian idea. 
you know
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub, we put a disco where you could dance, and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to, and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island. 
you know
because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. And I sold it to them -- I mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building. 
i mean
And I remember that that was just so telling, you know, that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen. 
you know
When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular -- JH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule. 
you know
You know, an example of something -- pregnancy. 
you know
So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know, taking two avatars and merging them, or something. 
you know
But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so -- I mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know, what goes on in the overall economy. 
you know
PR: Well, first of all, we're very early, so this has only been going on for a few years. 
well
And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies. 
you see
That said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture, is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world, and in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life, 65 percent of the people there are not in the United States, and in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages. 
you know
as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not -- many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing -- I'm just speaking broadly and critically -- it's not very appealing to people that play online video games, because the graphics are not yet equivalent to -- I mean, these are very nice pictures, 
 just 
but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4. 
you see
There's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life. 
you know
In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think, when you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know, challenge you to just do this and find out. 
you know
If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay? 
 just 
JH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creative when you were young and, you know, liked to make things. 
you know
I mean, it's not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative. 
i mean
 PR: I was a -- there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny. 
you know
So I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world, and obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something. 
you know
PR: If you count, yeah, cities. So -- but I did -- and I didn't do -- I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right. 
well
I wasn't, like, an obsessed -- you know, get A's kind of guy. 
you know
I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I -- JH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying? 
i guess
 PR: Well, I'd say a couple of things. 
well
Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here, but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober, disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side, has to conclude, based on the data, that with those kinds of economic forces at play, there is definitely going to be a sea change, and that change is going to be intensely disruptive 
you know
We must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant, and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps, than we are typically in our real lives. 
you know
But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this, other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes. 
you know
But you know what? 
you know
That's just 12 percent of the population. 
 just 
The fuel cell looked great: one-tenth as many moving parts and a fuel-cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine -- and it emits just water. 
 just 
The automobile becomes, then, an appliance, not in a commodity sense, but an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform for information and computing and communication, as well as a form of transportation. 
well
I just want to ask one. 
 just 
You know, I could be wrong about this, but my sense is that in the public mind, today, that GM is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford. 
you know
Are you serious about it, and not just, you know, when the consumers want it, when the regulators force us to do it we will go there? 
you know
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers, allows us to actually simulate, in this piece, over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64. 
 just 
But this is really just the beginning. 
 just 
And so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs. 
 just 
Now this piece is currently in process -- due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo, just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. 
 just 
And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy, so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie." 
 just 
Well, she and I went blackberry picking. 
well
This was in 1968, I guess it was. 
i guess
He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from, or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina -- some place that has a lot of music. 
well
I just fell in love with the culture and the people. 
 just 
And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player. 
you know
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. 
 just 
Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks. 
 just 
  Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year. 
 just 
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up. 
 just 
 Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys? 
well
 Well, it was 1954, I guess it was. 
well
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store, and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. 
you see
Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said, "You boys! You think you can have anything you want. 
well
Of course, we were just eight and 10. 
 just 
Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman: put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas -- it's hot. 
well
Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers. 
 just 
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this. 
 just 
Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess. 
well
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice. 
 just 
He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. 
well
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. 
well
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way. 
you know
Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field. 
 just 
Try this old song with me. I sing: Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. 
well
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. 
well
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. 
 just 
 Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument. 
well
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck, just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well. 
well
Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year, my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident, and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world. 
i guess
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief, just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in. 
 just 
And you know, at the top of the list, of course, were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them. 
you know
And for me, the sound of a steel guitar, because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things. 
 just 
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it, but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play. 
 just 
 Well, I hear you're having trouble. 
well
If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through. 
you know
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues. 
 just 
Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues. 
 just 
Now, you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes, but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get. 
you know
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose. 
 just 
This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid; I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one, you know, what they were making. It was like a library, just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see, just floors and floors of these things, and one of the engineers said, some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket. 
you know
Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael. 
well
Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon. 
well
Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder. 
well
We said, well, what are you going to do with it? 
well
 So we made them a big batch, and it was in my -- now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California. 
 just 
No problem. Yeah, you know." 
you know
It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this. 
 just 
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet; the air was the just full of black smoke. 
 just 
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay. 
okay
So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here, and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this. 
 just 
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here. 
you know
  But, of course, I'm working since 25, doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China. 
you see
 These were just some of the things I've made. 
 just 
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable than just the craftsmen do. 
well
Well, to describe our profession otherwise, we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty. 
well
EZ: Well, if you are sure, I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast. 
well
What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly, is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right, and then nod to the person on your left. 
 just 
 Now, chances are that over the last winter, if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died. 
 just 
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these very strange things that we can't begin to understand. 
you know
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know, the National Guard would be out. 
you know
If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually, a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course, the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get, you know, your three-pound packages of bees. 
you know
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die, to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer. 
you know
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious, intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet. 
you know
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world. 
 just 
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year. 
 just 
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy. 
 just 
I mean, there may be 100 explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is, but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor. 
i mean
You know, they pick up their hives; they move their families once or twice in a year. 
you know
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know, father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting. 
you know
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener, and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener. 
you know
Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola, I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know, jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients, -- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola -- 
you know
And that's a really great expression, because really, bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know -- they get paid for their services. 
you know
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks. 
okay
Well, these bees hang out at that hole, and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg, and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work. 
well
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees, you know that your environment is healthy, because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees. 
you know
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble, but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community. 
 just 
In fact, you know, the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea; it wouldn't be a bad idea. 
you know
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants, or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that -- and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine, this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances. 
you know
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things. 
you know
You see, the book was not driven by reading. 
you see
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show one or two more objects from the stage, but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it. 
 just 
You see, this is a human brain model, OK? 
you see
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net. 
you see
I'm just going to play a brief video clip. 
 just 
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money, not only on wine but on lots of things, and are they living a better life than me? 
you know
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. 
you see
Which, I guess, you know, communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price. 
you know
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know, "Would Signore like the truffles?" 
you know
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that, you know, their purpose had been served, and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me. 
you know
And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good, but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today. 
you know
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it, he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online, so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing, and, you know, gauge its freshness. 
you know
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know, you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs. 
you know
Oh, yeah, you know this one? 
you know
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know, hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries. 
you know
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans, and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form. 
you know
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet. 
i mean
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know, each buyer gets their name engraved on it. 
you know
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods. 
you know
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said, "You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour." 
you know
 This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology. 
 just 
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following. 
 just 
And you know, it had this fragrant softness, and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil. 
you know
And then I tasted it, and it, you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness, which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways. 
you know
And it wasn't just to that wine. 
 just 
Any one of the wines served at this tasting, if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know, the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable. 
you know
But drinking 60 great wines over three days, they all just blurred together, and it became almost a grueling experience. 
 just 
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech. 
 just 
A lot of people, you know, said that they liked the more expensive wine more -- it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive. 
you know
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek. 
well
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, 
you know
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes. 
you know
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan, and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung, and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly. 
well
So, this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though. 
 just 
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc. 
 just 
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide. 
you see
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which, by the way, doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. 
by the way
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know. 
well
Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say, "Me? I lost." "Me? I lost." 
 just 
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is. 
well
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food, but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat, you think, I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours. 
 just 
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario. 
 just 
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play. 
well
Now, just in case you're not getting it, here's a schematic of what happened, OK? 
 just 
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine, and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do? 
you see
Let me just give you an example. 
 just 
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience. 
well
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't, these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them, and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner, and what do you find? 
 just 
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers -- these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers, and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better. 
you know
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient. 
well
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12, they might as well wait 13. 
well
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year. 
 just 
What you see here are two lads, one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler. 
you see
Here are the results of what I just showed you. 
 just 
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this: If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon? 
well
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug? 
i mean
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look. 
i mean
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it? 
i mean
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know, go to Israel. And a mall blows up, and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on. 
well
I mean, this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it, shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks. 
i mean
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said, Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us. 
you know
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty? 
i mean
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude, unless someone can show that there's, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come. 
you know
CA: We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past, in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth, and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things? 
 just 
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. 
well
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before. 
you see
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before, our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated. 
you know
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of, which is the error of value. 
you know
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose, and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that? 
well
Now, economists tend to --  -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses, which is: this is just a bunch of stupid people. 
 just 
 DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember, people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either, even though they don't feel great during the drawing. 
well
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. 
well
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes, not just as our home. 
 just 
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other, even on this planet. 
well
Certainly, in the last 15 years, we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed, and just last month, a couple of weeks ago, a planet in the size-class of Earth has actually been found. 
 just 
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be, I would've probably said, a couple of percent. 
well
How do you know it when you find it? 
you know
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy to study microscopic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth, at much smaller scales than ever before. 
well
So, perspective is everything and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about, I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. 
 just 
This is my favorite game on airplanes: where you're in an airplane and you look out the window, you see the horizon. 
you see
In this cave, great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here, and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down. 
you see
Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves, which are a by-product of volcanic activity, in many cases, by these beautiful, glistening silver walls, or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold. 
well
So, lava-tube caves-- I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet. 
 just 
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves. 
you know
Well, we're going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions. 
well
I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top. 
you see
So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study, looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars. 
 just 
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today. The experiment is -- and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded, that you did it in a typical North American way, that is, you were raucous and incoherent. 
by the way
 So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize. 
i mean
So to put the question a little more seriously, let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did, for spontaneous synchronization. 
 just 
Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize? 
 just 
Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right? 
i mean
I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not. 
i mean
There are just three simple rules. 
 just 
Here on the model you see the predator attacking. 
you see
And you see that in nature. 
you see
It's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think, As I say, it's just those three simple rules, plus the one about watch out for predators. 
 just 
I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding. 
i mean
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment. 
 just 
We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from. 
you know
If you see fireflies in North America, like so many North American sorts of things, they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other. 
you see
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none. 
you know
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video, that they really were very well synchronized. 
well
Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order, and I've already hinted that the answer is no. 
well
Well, you don't have to be a whole creature. 
well
You can even be just a single cell. 
 just 
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles. 
 just 
All right, so, I've got a metronome, and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise. 
well
What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same. 
 just 
Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces. 
well
I'm going to put them on a movable platform, which is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is. 
okay
 All right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there. 
 just 
Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think? 
 just 
Boy: It was about -- Interviewer: I mean, that much, or this much? 
i mean
Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me. 
 just 
Boy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance because if you didn't keep your balance, then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees. 
 just 
Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right. 
 just 
Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge. 
 just 
Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome, but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk. 
i mean
But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie, who figured out what happened on the bridge, and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was. 
you see
Actually, I think the first person you'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay. 
okay
Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble. 
well
Their instructions: just walk normally. 
 just 
SS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks, maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over. 
well
The change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. 
 just 
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. 
you know
They need to learn learning. And then, just think -- they can have, let's say, 100 books. 
 just 
Sometimes school is under a tree, or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education, so you need a collaborative model of learning, not just building more schools and training more teachers, which you have to do anyway. 
 just 
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown. 
you see
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over, and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles, and one here in San Francisco, called Benkyodo, which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan. 
well
Well, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies. 
well
Another of my favorite dishes: General Tso's Chicken -- which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken. 
by the way
So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war. 
you know
You see different varieties of Chinese food. 
you see
 And they totally randomly take Chinese noodle dishes, and just ramenize them. 
 just 
But you know what? 
you know
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters. 
you know
I'll just start talking about the 17th century. 
 just 
I -- you know, when I -- after I had invented PCR, I kind of needed a change. 
you know
You know, sometimes there's a 10-, 15-minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in. 
you know
You know, they get a real bad rap in the world. 
you know
And I realized, the roots of the way I sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things. 
 just 
That -- you know, I was born thinking about things that way, and I had always been like a little scientist guy. 
you know
And when I went to find out something, I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised, you know, when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science, because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever. 
you know
You know, it was -- like it happened in England, and Germany, and Italy sort of all at the same time. 
you know
And it's, it's a kind of -- You know, Charles I got beheaded somewhere early in the 17th century. 
you know
And the English set up Cromwell and a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever, and not the kind of Republicans we had. 
well
And they would get really pissy, and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight about issues like whether or not it was okay if Robert Boyle made a device called the vacuum pump. 
okay
 Which was -- back then it was sort of, you know, well, you know -- if you made this thing -- he made this little device, like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of -- you know what a bell jar is? One of these things, you pick it up, put it down, and it's got a seal, and you can see inside of it, 
well
I mean, the first -- I think one of the first experiments he did was he put a bird in there. 
i mean
And people in the 17th century, they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know, this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules, and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that. 
you know
I mean, fish don't know much about water, and people didn't know much about air. 
i mean
Ah, uh --  Aristotle said that nature abhors one. 
 uh 
And you know, Boyle says, well, shit. 
well
I mean, whatever that is that kills the bird -- and I'm calling it a vacuum. 
i mean
And the religious people said that if God wanted you to make -- I mean, God is everywhere, that was one of their rules, is God is everywhere. 
i mean
I mean, you want to call it Godless, you know, you call it Godless. 
you know
He had another fan opposed to it that he had like a -- I mean, the way I would have done this would be, like, a rubber band, and, you know, around a tinker toy kind of fan. 
you know
Something was missing, you know. I mean, these are -- it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that, but that was what was going on at the time. 
you know
And like, there was big arguments about it in the -- you know, the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff. 
you know
Charles II was kind of saying, you know, you should keep that -- let's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don't get so -- you know, we don't want the -- we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so -- because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that, that's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble. 
you know
And so, Charles said, I'm going to put up the money give you guys a building, come here and you can meet in the building, but just don't talk about religion in there. 
 just 
And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society, they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well. 
well
And seeing what happens, it was OK to generalize, and say, I'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things. 
 ok 
Like if you do an experiment on stage, and nobody can see it, they can just hear it, they would probably think you were freaky. 
 just 
I mean, reality is what you can see. 
i mean
That wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting, but I'm sure that was part of it, you know. If people hear voices, and they can't see and associate it with somebody, that person's probably not there. 
you know
It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes, who was a local philosopher, said about it, you know, because you weren't going to be talking final causes. What's happening here, in the middle of the 17th century, was that what became my field -- science, experimental science -- was pulling itself away, and it was in a physical way, because we're going to do it in this room over here, but it was also what -- it was an amazing thing that happened. 
you know
I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled a thing that was really impeding technology from being developed. 
 just 
And, I mean, everybody in this room -- now, this is 350 short years ago. 
i mean
You know, the ones that turned to the right, there are some of those in the Japanese translation. 
you know
But in that 350 years, the place has just undergone a lot of changes. 
 just 
I mean, if you can think how important -- If you have a GPS system and there are no satellites, it's not going to be much use. But, like -- but, you know, if somebody had a GPS system in the 17th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it, you know. If that person -- Audience: For the teddy bear? The teddy bear? 
you know
I mean, individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get. 
i mean
You know, the important people -- you can almost read about their lives, about all the really important people that made advances, you know. 
you know
And, I mean -- this kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do -- now I, when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something -- you know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot, and my mother didn't really know much science, but I thought if you want to know something about stuff, 
you know
you do it -- you make an experiment, you know. 
you know
You get -- you get, like -- I just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought. 
 just 
It isn't true. I mean, there's a lot of people -- You know, I was one of those scientists that was -- got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post-modernism thing. 
you know
 KM: I mean, I didn't really think of that as an argument so much as just a lively discussion. 
 just 
I didn't take it personally, but -- I just -- I had -- I naively had thought, until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century, I'd thought that's just the way people thought, and everybody did, and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear. 
 just 
And I knew that frogs -- little frogs -- had aspirations of space travel, just like people. And I --  I was looking for a -- a propulsion system that would like, make a rocket, like, maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles. 
 just 
And, I mean, that was my sort of goal. 
i mean
 You know, that's what you call a lead. 
you know
 You sort of -- now you say, well, let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar, and heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do, and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work. 
well
And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on, and if there was any puffs of smoke out there, she'd lean out and admonish us all not to blow our eyes out. That was her -- You know, that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us. 
you know
Nowadays, it's no ma'am, check your shoes. And like --  But then it wasn't -- they didn't have any, but the guy had -- I said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know. 
you know
You know, I started off with little tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar, which was readily available, and I mixed it in different proportions, and I tried to light it on fire. 
you know
I mean, the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down -- you'd light it, and it would just start dancing around the yard. 
 just 
 So I started developing -- you know, George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother. 
you know
I didn't know what the rules were, I'm a natural born scientist, I guess, or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century, whatever. 
i guess
And we had not -- I mean, we weren't frightened by it. 
i mean
We should have been, because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise, and it was powerful, you know. 
you know
But I wasn't worried, by the way, about, you know, the explosion causing the destruction of the planet. 
you know
I hadn't heard about the 10 ways that we should be afraid of the -- By the way, I could have thought, I'd better not do this because they say not to, you know. 
you know
If I'd have waited around for that, I would have never -- the frog would have died, you know. 
you know
At any rate, I bring it up because it's a good story, and he said, tell personal things, you know, and that's a personal -- I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife, but that would be too personal, wouldn't it. 
you know
But in the actual process, you get an idea -- like, when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides, and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA, you know, the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car, and then instead of going -- I went back and I did talk to people about it, 
you know
You know, if I had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not, he would have said, no, it probably won't. 
you know
You know, that's how you do science. 
you know
And then you say, well, what can make it work better? 
well
And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean, it's all -- you've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work. 
i mean
I mean, you can't make up results, and then do another experiment based on that one. 
i mean
So you have to be honest. 
to be honest
I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty would always get me in trouble, if I, like -- so I've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive, and that sort of leads to that kind of science. 
 just 
You know -- and there is a lot --  There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened. 
you know
One of the things that happened right around World War II in that same time period before, and as sure as hell afterwards, government got -- realized that scientists aren't strange dudes that, you know, hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube. 
you know
Scientists, you know, made World War II as we know it quite possible. 
you know
You know, they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process. 
you know
And everybody stepped back a little and said, you know, we ought to invest in this shit, because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position, at least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways. 
you know
And they got involved in it, and the scientific and industrial establishment was born, and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money, you know, because it was suddenly available. 
you know
They were the same people that later went in to medical school, you know, because there was money in it, you know. I mean, later, then they all got into business -- I mean, there are waves of -- going into your high school, person saying, you want to be rich, you know, be a scientist. You know, not anymore. 
you know
And those people don't think -- they don't -- they don't always tell you the truth, you know. 
you know
I mean, if you actually measure the temperature over a period -- I mean, the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years -- longer than that it's been measured, but in really nice, precise ways, and records have been kept for 50 or 60 years, and in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up. 
i mean
It's like, the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit, because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit. 
 just 
And even then, you know, because the buildings get warm in the daytime, and they keep it a little warmer at night. 
you know
It should have been. But not a lot. Not like, you know -- the first guy -- the first guy that got the idea that we're going to fry ourselves here, actually, he didn't think of it that way. 
you know
He was thinking of the earth as, kind of like, you know, like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it, really, just energy coming down, energy leaving. 
you know
And so he came up with this theory, and he said, this will be cool, because it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden, you know, and the surfers liked it, the surfers thought, that's a cool idea, because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes, and -- but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad, you know. 
you know
I mean, the temperature as measured -- and you can find this on our wonderful Internet, you just go and look for all NASAs records, and all the Weather Bureau's records, and you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just -- the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit. 
 just 
So if you just average that and the daytime temperature, it looks like it went up about .7 degrees in this century. 
 just 
But in fact, it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up. 
 just 
Now, people like things that have, like, names like that, that they can envision it, right? I mean -- but people don't like things like this, so -- most -- I mean, you don't get all excited about things like the actual evidence, you know, which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the 1990s. 
you know
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine, February the first, and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers, and in also the Science editor's, like, descriptions of these papers, for, you know, for the quickie, is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean, what these guys were doing, and this is what -- the NASA people have been saying this for a long time. 
you know
When it gets warm it generates -- it makes redder energy -- I mean, like infra-red, like something that's warm gives off infra-red. 
i mean
Well, these guys measured all of those things. 
well
I mean, you can talk about that stuff, and you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it, but these -- they actually measured it, and it turns out that in the last 10 years -- that's why they say "decadal" there -- that the energy -- that the level of what they call "imbalance" has been way the hell over what was expected. 
i mean
Like, the amount of imbalance -- meaning, heat's coming in and it's not going out that you would get from having double the CO2, which we're not anywhere near that, by the way. 
by the way
Well, they found out in this study -- these two studies by two different teams -- that five and a half watts per square meter and the place didn't get warmer. 
well
These papers should have been called, "The End to the Global Warming Fiasco," you know. 
you know
You know, if they said, you know what? 
you know
There isn't a problem with global warming any longer, so we can -- you know, they're funding. 
you know
It's not by a small one. They just -- they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth -- there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about, because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer. 
 just 
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know, it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful, and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about. 
you know
So I mean, the reason I put those things all together, OK, here's the way you're supposed to do science -- some science is done for other reasons, and just curiosity. 
 just 
And there's a lot of things like global warming, and ozone hole and you know, a whole bunch of scientific public issues, that if you're interested in them, then you have to get down the details, and read the papers called, "Large Decadal Variability in the..." 
you know
And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues, and making a lot of money out of it, you'll be misinformed, and you'll be worrying about the wrong things. 
 just 
I mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK, thank you for having me here. 
i mean
I mean, this was great. 
i mean
It's such a great way to -- I mean, they should make Java books like this, and we've have no problem learning a program. 
i mean
But this was a great, grand time of the computer, when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era. 
 just 
And, you see, this era coincided with my own childhood. 
you see
It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu; it was a family business. 
you know
So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken for two weeks in the store, and that week -- now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I had to do everything. 
you know
Because, you see, we'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it, like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow. 
you see
So, when I got to MIT, you know, as most of you who are creatives, your parents all told you not to be creative, right? 
you know
So, same way, you know, I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's -- John's good at math. 
you know
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out; I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. 
 just 
And when I was making icons, I was, like, the icon master, and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know. 
you know
And then luckily, you know, I had the fortune of going to something called a library, and in the library I came upon this very book. 
you know
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand, who was one of the greatest graphic designers, and also a great writer as well. 
well
And just began to design stuff, like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on: sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever. 
 just 
So, I was published, you know, so, wow, my design's in a book, you know? 
you know
I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer, you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread? 
you know
You know, he wrote in one of his books: "A Yale student once said, 'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.' Design schools take heed." 
you know
Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving. 
well
And he says, Well, when's it going to stop? 
well
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once: you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this. 
you know
And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer, I had a moment of -- what is it called? -- the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. 
 just 
To give you a sense of the speed, the scale: the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.? 
 just 
He'd come in and say, you know, If I am here, everything is okay. 
you know
And you'd feel so much better, you know. 
you know
So, if you can see here, you know, that program you're seeing in the corner, if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once. 
you know
And also, at the same time I was frustrated, because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere, and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know, and this is, like, in the late 1990s, and this is in Basel, a great graphic design school. 
you know
Is this what we want, you know? 
you know
And also, I began to be fascinated by machines -- you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel. 
you know
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me, so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think, Well, what else is there in life? 
well
And so computers, as you know, these big computers, there are now tiny computers. 
you know
Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. 
 just 
I've done shoes for Reebok as well, as a kind of a hobby for apparel. 
well
The world is just so tasty. 
 just 
I put these all back, by the way. 
by the way
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. 
well
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land -- the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters. 
 just 
I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example. 
i mean
And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us about, you know, how evolution works on land? 
you know
Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it, digging it up for many years, I end up looking at the mammal radiation, and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology, advancing by an order of magnitude. 
 just 
So there's lessons to learn, and there's lessons to learn from the exception, the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made, and many other scholars have made around the world. 
well
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we're going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. 
 just 
I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions: "Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?" 
well
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs and find, really, everything that existed -- not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky, and you dig a place like that, you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did. 
 just 
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know, or your kids know, at least, on four legs. 
you know
Well, they're composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose. 
well
And, you know, on and on -- a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this -- and some of you have had the chance to touch it -- this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old. 
you know
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of -- all those small animals -- they all come from northern continents. 
you know
And huge things -- I mean, this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile. 
 just 
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure. 
 just 
Narrator: If they can just land it, this croc will provide useful data, helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus. 
 just 
PS: Okay, when I say three, we move. 
okay
So -- there were --  Well, you know, the -- the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way. 
well
You get divided, and a continent's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree, or you're crafty, and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division, or you're living peacefully on each side, and on one side you just go extinct, and you survive on the other side and create a difference. 
 just 
So you see the tree of life, but now I've added the dimension of area. 
you see
I mean, is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen, in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there, or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another? 
i mean
We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase, and now, as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing, it becomes even more prominent. Where are all these people going to come from? 
you see
It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say, well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start, but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education. 
well
Many of you could ask the question, you know, why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately, a roadable aircraft, possible at this time? 
you know
They'd worn themselves out, beating themselves against the window, and, well, they were easy to capture. 
well
Historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals, and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads. 
you see
Well, you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy. 
well
I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet. 
i mean
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that. 
i suppose
Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation in something like the Skycar, probably in another volantor form as well, will be a significant part of our lives, as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years. 
well
You know, literally after seeing that image, and finding out what Bateson was working with, we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form. 
you know
To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus: the fact that they're calculus-based means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements. 
 just 
You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension, because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. 
you know
It's just a curve without inflection. 
 just 
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know, in the example of the nose to the face, there's a fractional part-to-whole idea. 
you know
It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus, so I brought some images to just describe how that works. 
 just 
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits So, these are the different perspectives of that interior, which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form. 
 just 
So, it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel. 
 just 
Basically what we can do, is just cut a graphite mold, put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees, gently inflate titanium that's soft, and then explode it at the last minute into this form. 
 just 
So, for me, what was important is that this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot, a teapot, and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- that they would have a coherence -- so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots -- but that everyone who bought one would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way. 
 just 
And I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction. 
 just 
Finally, I'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication. 
 just 
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills, to just replace, kind of, young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models. 
 just 
I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years, and just loved utilitarian form -- simple things that we use every day, little compositions of color and surface on form. 
 just 
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach, a company dealing with simple forms, making good designers available to us, and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well, and it seems to have worked. 
well
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights 
you know
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized, you know, the first job of design is to serve a social purpose. 
you know
Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure: horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines going across, these magenta squiggles, the workmen being reduced to decorative elements, just a nice, kind of, breakup of the urban place. 
 just 
And, you know, that no longer exists. 
you know
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good. 
you know
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco -- a trash can that's been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships, and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture. 
 just 
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative and so tolerant. 
you know
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also, and I think that it's recognizable there, and has an important effect on culture, because their public spaces are protected, their sidewalks are protected, and you're actually able to confront these things physically, and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things. 
well
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. 
you know
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo. 
you know
And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements, it can do just about anything. 
 just 
In a very short period of time, completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such, and we had to get up and leave; it was just that uncomfortable. 
 just 
The last shots that I have deal with -- coming back to this theme of sidewalks, and I wanted to say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know. 
you know
Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy; he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap, although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test, which was for vision. 
 just 
But to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal. 
 just 
He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist, even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever: everything he saw was just a blur. 
 just 
And, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say, yeah, ha-ha, you know -- it's all microfilm. But that's -- that's not the point. He understood the shape of the future. 
you know
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred 
 just 
and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips singing "Midnight Train to Georgia," while --  -- in my dad's big easy chair, you know? 
you know
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art, which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all, or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of "Inspired by Nature" -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him, 
 just 
 So -- so this was my nature. The thing was, I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was, I saw it as just this road to discovery. 
 just 
Actually, it was just me embracing my nature, which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all. 
 just 
So what does a "scientific mind" Well, I started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them, almost immediately. 
well
Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage, as well. 
well
What's interesting is, once you hit print -- and this is from 1450, by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves: rectilinear panel arrangements, simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence. 
by the way
And within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions, and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here. 
 just 
And it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about Moore's Law, about Moore's Law back in the '70s, and I knew what was coming. 
 just 
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages. 
 just 
And I thought, O.K., well, if that's true, is there any way, when we go beyond today's print, to somehow bring that back? 
well
Now, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right? 
 just 
That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now. 
 just 
But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, that's just where the technology is right now. 
 just 
I just want to get to the last panel. 
 just 
  Just one more. 
 just 
Well, in this technique, what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world, the artisan bread-baking community, has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads. 
well
 The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is, you know, how do you make it taste good? 
you know
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us, or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber, for the bran is fiber. 
 just 
It's just dough that is wet. 
 just 
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we -- in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages. 
okay
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage. 
okay
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is "mise en place," which is just a French way of saying, "get organized." 
 just 
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization -- when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them, they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst. 
well
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting? 
i mean
It's just a euphemism for killing, right? 
 just 
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know? 
you know
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life. 
you know
The first transformation -- and, by the way, the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else. 
by the way
Well, in this case, the first transformation is alive to dead. 
well
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam. 
by the way
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive. 
well
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know. 
you know
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that, again completing the life cycle, you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that -- it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this. 
you know
And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here, again, is to use, in addition to everything we talked about, this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread" because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making. 
you know
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years, is that goods have become commoditized. 
well
They just care about three things and three things only: price, price and price. 
 just 
My first book was called "Mass Customization" -- it came up a couple of times yesterday -- and how I discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service, because it was done just for a particular person, because it wasn't inventoried, it was delivered on demand to that individual person. 
 just 
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price; fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing; and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods, but services as well. 
well
You know the words I mean? 
you know
 But nonetheless, not just the Dutch, but everyone has this desire for the authentic. 
 just 
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get a two-by-two. 
well
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as -- you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake, right, because you can see behind the facade, right? 
you know
Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles, well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot, outside in this city. 
well
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself. 
 just 
When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment. 
 just 
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean? 
you know
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn, and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there. 
 just 
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak, but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica, and I made parodies about it. 
 just 
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring. 
you know
And what I responded to was, you know, Art Nouveau, or deco, or Victorian typography, or things that were just completely not Helvetica. 
you know
I wasn't educated. I just sort of put these things together. 
 just 
I just hated Helvetica. 
 just 
 And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play, a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well-educated. 
well
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world, and they started winning awards, and people knew them. 
i mean
And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position, and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity, it's the moment of serious play. 
you know
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics, and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away, which meant I had to change it. 
 just 
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do. 
 just 
And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said, Well, I think we can paint it. 
well
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place, it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be? 
i mean
So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents, and I went to Pittsburgh and I said, "You know, really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town. 
you know
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project, and so utterly ridiculous, and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness, just completely because it was so goofy to begin with. 
 just 
We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense, and how it was really derived from an umbrella, and we made animations of these things, and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. 
 um
So, I'm plugging along here --  and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase. 
 just 
Now, I agree that you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions and, you know, if you use a slide projector, you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side, or up or down, but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off, to trade that off for a focus. 
you know
 It's a thought. Just a thought. 
 just 
 This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time, and I thought -- you know, fly all night, I looked up, and I thought, wow, how clean. 
you know
I mean, how nice is that? 
i mean
Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture. 
 just 
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message. 
you know
You know, it's pretty clear. 
you know
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it. 
 just 
And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it. 
well
So, apparently when photography was perfected, there were people going around saying, that's it: you've just ruined painting. 
 just 
People are just going to take pictures now. 
 just 
There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why." 
 just 
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric, and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times, predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising, television, media world. 
 just 
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now. 
 just 
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking? 
you know
 I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. 
 just 
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense. 
well
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night, and there were definitely some heads turning, you know, people smoking and, "Huh!" 
you know
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something; it looked like they might be real. Anyway. 
you know
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out. 
 just 
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas, and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin. 
 just 
This was either an old product with new packaging, or a brand-new package, and I just thought, Yikes! How's that still happening? 
 just 
The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night, and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ... 
 just 
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. 
well
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday." 
 um
So, we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative: their over-competitiveness, their, you know, long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it. 
you know
You know: Thank God it's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls, and hear everybody else's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home. 
you know
 I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know. 
you know
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ... 
you know
This is an opener for Brian Eno, and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music. 
 just 
 Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat. 
 just 
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile. 
well
Look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she's going through? -- and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps." 
 just 
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate. 
 just 
I'm just not sure this is improvement. 
 just 
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work, and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. 
well
 But, you know, the government would make a plane; they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you? 
you know
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith, you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species. 
you know
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology, and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools. 
you know
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s, and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20, in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device -- in your washing machine, your cell phone. 
 just 
It's, sort of, like if you ask people, Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband? 
well
You know, they are generally put together in pairs, creating a word or what we call base pairs. 
you know
And you would, you know, when you think about it, four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work. 
you know
And that may not sound very intuitive, but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers. 
you know
So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music, that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly. 
 just 
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero. 
 just 
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity, a lot of ways to describe mechanisms. 
well
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing, we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office. 
 just 
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. 
 just 
So, up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology, which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it, and maybe it's going to make it work. 
well
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor, look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different. 
 just 
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA -- genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months. 
 just 
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know, whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that. 
you know
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs. 
well
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting. 
well
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay. 
okay
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms. 
you know
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself, So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live? 
 just 
Well, guess what. It does. 
well
Well, actually, you could do it the other way. 
well
So, you know, by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism, the software, if you will, changes the hardware. 
you know
They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well. 
well
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir. 
well
By the way, just so you know: you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms; there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified. 
you know
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance; we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs. 
you know
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants, as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes, it is the ecosystem around them, it is the microbes that live in their root systems, that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves. 
 just 
This is not big news to viticulturists; they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization. 
you know
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it -- we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what? 
well
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human, they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes; we can figure out what they are. 
you know
All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs, sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like -- that's just a big database -- and then fertilize. 
 just 
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson -- he's not always the most politically correct guy ... 
you know
 ... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?" 
you know
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question: "Well, somebody has to." 
well
 I consider myself a very spiritual person, and without, you know, the organized religion part, and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural. 
you know
Now, we can create bad impacts -- we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth -- but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made. 
 just 
There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast. 
you know
We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules; we're just learning what the rules are. 
 just 
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease -- if you could make disease go away, because we understand how it actually works, if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants if we could create clean and plentiful energy -- we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics, have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline. 
 just 
Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple: working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand, is the next step in humankind's evolution. 
well
 And it's just going to get more wild. 
 just 
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet, rather than just hand-carrying the videotape. 
 just 
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness" as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand, for what this imaginary project could aspire to, not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. 
 just 
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project," "Smart Mobs for Natural Security" -- but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say. 
 just 
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly. 
i mean
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world. 
you see
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection, able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up. 
 just 
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together, making use of technological innovations and human communities alike, we might just be able to fix it ourselves. 
 just 
We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all; we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used. 
 just 
And as we say at Worldchanging, another world isn't just possible; another world is here. 
 just 
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much. 
 just 
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right. 
 just 
 I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000, but Hollywood goes to the chase. 
i mean
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night, and tried to write a counter-argument to it, and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable, for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place where you could probably get not just life, but complexity, 
well
Well, "Rare Earth" actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public. 
well
Well, the second part of that, soon after -- and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience, and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth." 
well
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me, and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist." 
 just 
I mean, there we are. 
i mean
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth-like life, it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse -- that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface -- because of rampant carbon dioxide. 
well
Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet. 
well
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death. It's strange -- extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon. 
well
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules, and it's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz. 
 just 
I mean, it must be true, because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time, and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000, totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes. 
i mean
Well, there are five major mass extinctions over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five. 
well
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors. 
you know
The age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago ... 
well
Now, luckily, this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here: this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture -- there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny -- this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished. 
 just 
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't? 
well
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty, swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes. 
 just 
So, I really suspect there's an alternative, and that life does actually try to do itself in -- not consciously, but just because it does. 
 just 
Well, what's the source of this? 
well
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything, it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it. 
well
Well now, I die. 
well
How many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year? 
 just 
 Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter. 
 just 
You know, I am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 41 -- when she was five, was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers, If it doesn't bleed when you cut it, my daddy doesn't understand it. 
you know
One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do. 
well
And when I did, I thought, well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary. 
well
Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery. 
well
If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works. 
you know
If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work. 
you know
And you know what I found out? 
you know
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by? 
you know
What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself; to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of. 
i mean
Now, we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays, too, and the most well-remembered essay is one called "A Defence of Poetry." 
well
See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself. 
 just 
Well, you know precisely what it is. 
well
And we have had examples over and over and over again -- you've just heard one in the last 15 minutes -- of people who have not only had that commitment, but had the charisma, the brilliance -- and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God -- the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest, and who no doubt will continue to succeed, 
 just 
Golly, I'm just totally losing it. 
 just 
Now, think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. 
 just 
You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants. 
 just 
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is, and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it, we wouldn't have that, or movies in general, or computers, or T.V. sets, or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light. 
 just 
I just happened to get my education in a little different way. 
 just 
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is: virtually nothing -- and I mean this honestly -- has been invented yet. 
i mean
We're just starting. 
 just 
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. 
 just 
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made. 
you know
that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet. 
 just 
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. 
 just 
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much, I'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. 
well
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. 
 just 
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people, and there can be a public beach just off to the side, and they don't even know it's turned on. 
 just 
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash. 
 just 
Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago. 
 just 
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit, and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. 
 just 
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs. 
well
SS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don't we start there? 
well
AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports. 
well
And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps -- big, thick, five-ply wool socks on -- you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known. 
you know
And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things -- and they're all looking at me like, OK, we know who's not going to win this race. 
you know
And, I mean, I went up there expecting -- I don't know what I was expecting -- but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet, two inches ... 
you know
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta, I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes, without qualifying that word "athlete." 
 just 
And, you know, people said, "Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed -- but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track. 
you know
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world. 
 just 
He's just a rather intimidating figure. 
 just 
 "I want to see if I can, you know -- I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices, see what drills you do and whatever." 
you know
That's all I wanted -- just two practices. 
 just 
"Can I just sit in and see what you do?" 
 just 
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything." 
well
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?" 
you know
That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around, he said, "You know, you're good enough. 
you know
SS: Well, on your way to the Olympics, a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown. 
well
Why don't you just tell them? 
 just 
AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts -- you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo -- and they're all looking at me like, "Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?" 
well
And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that, you know, in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country -- you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you. 
you know
And it's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio, and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket. 
you see
And I, I mean, was just mortified -- because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour. 
you know
And he just sat there like this. 
 just 
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn; he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off? 
you know
AM: Okay, well, Atlanta. 
well
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification, are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the Special Olympics, which deals with people with mental disabilities. 
 just 
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta, and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters. 
 just 
I had just done the long jump, and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says, "How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot, so we can't get off on the springboard." 
you know
I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that." 
well
So, it's funny -- I'm three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point, you know, so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up? 
you know
And I'm sure of it, you know? 
you know
I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years, you know? 
you know
I tried to get it out of anybody I could, you know, "Who am I running against here?" 
you know
 So, I'm just, like -- they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know? 
you know
You know, I'd never lost anything, like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know, I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first. 
you know
And, you know, I'm just thinking, "Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania." 
you know
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter. 
you know
So they call us out and, you know -- "Ladies, you have one minute." 
you know
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd, like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see. 
 just 
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here; if I'm not going to beat these girls, I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know? 
you know
 I mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany, and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat. 
i mean
And the gun went off, and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible -- this feeling of just being overwhelmed. 
 just 
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete. 
you know
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before, on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying, "Here's my life going in this direction -- and I want to take it here for a while, and just seeing how far I could push it." 
 just 
And that was this collective glory -- that there was, you know, 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta. 
you know
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do: sitting back and realizing the progression, how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know. 
you know
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs. 
you know
AM: Well, these are my pretty legs. 
well
Like, you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want. 
 just 
You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off." 
 just 
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over, to keep it on. Which, when I sweat, you know, I'm pistoning out of it. 
you know
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it. 
 just 
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know, it's like a big -- it's come full circle. 
you know
For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track, I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity, whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion. 
you know
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want -- and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people. 
i mean
 It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel. 
 just 
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it. 
i mean
And this is just a silicon piece of skin. 
 just 
I mean, what happened was, two years ago this man in Belgium was saying, "God, if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes, looking so real as if she breathed, why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?" 
i mean
I mean, they make ears for burn victims. 
i mean
 AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side -- I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me? 
 just 
Because I have this problem ... " You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like, "If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late." 
you know
When we started thinking about this project -- how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously -- well, there's some problems with this idea. 
well
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop. 
 just 
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses, like the common cold, like polio and so on, and I just broke them down into small segments. 
 just 
And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus, and just break it into small windows. 
 just 
These sequences right up here -- which don't even code for protein, by the way -- are almost absolutely identical across all of these, so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses, without having to make something individual. 
by the way
And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation through evolution -- how these viruses evolved -- by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents. 
 just 
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school, I've been messing around making DNA chips -- that is, printing DNA on glass. 
well
And that's what you see here: These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass, and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent. 
you see
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots, and this is what you see: you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here. 
you see
So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass -- little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens. 
 just 
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry, you can build one of these too, and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free, with basically order-off-the-shelf parts. 
 just 
 And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip. 
 just 
I talked about that -- you know, that situation where you go into the clinic and you don't get diagnosed? 
you know
Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure -- I mean, why not? 
well
And so, that's a hard way to look at things, so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode, grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way. 
 just 
There're 102 known variants of the common cold, and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them: there are just new ones every year. 
 just 
We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field. 
 just 
But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right? 
you know
Well, it's pretty simple. 
well
This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid. 
by the way
Or, even better, let's just take people right out of the emergency room -- undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections. 
 just 
We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So --  -- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold. 
i mean
Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good. 
well
 But by the time you get to block nine, you see that respiratory syncytial virus. 
you see
Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this, you need a little bit more informatics, so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis. 
well
There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure, and so basically -- and what do they learn from it? 
 just 
All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis. 
well
I mean, they went to the max for this woman. 
i mean
They gave us endotracheal aspirate -- you know, a little fluid from the throat, from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this. 
you know
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4. 
well
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4? 
well
There's just a little bit of it sequenced. 
 just 
And why is that? Just lore. There's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease. 
 just 
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses? 
 just 
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid, but that's what, you know, science is really good at. 
you know
Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here.    Thank you!  I took my shoes off to dance, but maybe I'll get at that later. 
 just 
Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, 
well
My uncle is a very well-known Cape Breton fiddler. 
well
His name's Buddy MacMaster, and just a wonderful guy, and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing, and we had parties, great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses, and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs. 
 just 
Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, could play it, so you'd have someone come 
well
into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music. 
 just 
I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy.  
i guess
 Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here, but I'm just trying to put it all together, trying to figure all you people out, and I've been here for a short while, and I'm starting to understand a little bit better. 
 just 
And she said, just talk about yourself. 
 just 
It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario, an hour and a half northeast of Toronto, and we grew up on a farm. 
 just 
That's how we met.  You tell them.  NM: You want to or no?  Well I guess I have to now. Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, 
well
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro," which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper. 
well
That's it.   Then — Will I keep going?   Then we dated for two years, broke up for 10, got back together and got married.   DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it. 
 just 
    NM: Well, we're gonna play one together now.  We're laughing, like, because our styles are totally different, as you can hear. 
well
And so, you know, Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play, but we don't have any of those ready. 
you know
We just started yesterday.  So we're gonna play something together anyway. 
 just 
 NM: Okay. Sure. 
okay
All right, okay. 
okay
NM: Well, um... 
 um
The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it. 
 just 
It had gone through, like, five or six families, and it was just a big thing for us, and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago. 
 just 
DL: What about Leahy?  NM: Just tell them what— DL: She wants me to talk about— We have a band named Leahy. 
 just 
There's 11 siblings. We, um— What will I tell them?  We opened— NM: No surgeries. 
 um
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah. 
 oh 
It was a big thing for us, and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married, so we're staying close to home for, I guess, another couple of weeks. 
i guess
 I like it.   DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished, so of course, what we would do is we'd get on the piano 
 oh 
Okay, play in, how about A? 
okay
I had just taken trigonometry in high school, I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus. 
 just 
You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back-up. 
 just 
And I concluded, after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels, different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy. 
 just 
Usually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today, with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many, many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes. 
 just 
So what you see here is 12 separate petals, that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar. 
you see
James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it. 
 just 
I mean, all of the improvements he made -- and it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt, today is named after him. 
i mean
Steam engines are dangerous, and they had tremendous impact on the world, as you know -- industrial revolution and ships and locomotives. 
you know
So, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, you're just alternately heating and cooling the air. 
 just 
And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea, which was, well I'm still not heating the metal now, with this kind of engine, but I'm still reheating all the air. 
well
It's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top -- this part gets hot, this part is cool, and electricity comes out. 
 just 
You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house, you just save money with each incremental one you add. 
 just 
Pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place, but even the green or blue areas are good, just not as good as the places that are red, orange and yellow. 
 just 
It just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid-supplied electricity. 
 just 
It's just how many watts do you get per dollar, and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way. 
 just 
It's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there, and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that. 
 just 
And at less than a five-year payback, all of a sudden this becomes very economic So you don't have to just want to have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. 
 just 
It just makes economic sense. 
 just 
If you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it -- someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money, basically from day one. 
 just 
I was walking from the elevator over here, and even just looking at the stage right now -- so there's probably 20 500 watt lights right now. 
 just 
So there's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit. 
 just 
And it's just amazing, walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator. 
 just 
And we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are, I think. 
 just 
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years. 
well
Why? Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria. 
well
Well, what's the history of this disease? 
well
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. 
 just 
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much. 
 just 
I brought some here, just so you could experience this. 
 just 
It involves social scientists, so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets, but 90 percent. 
 just 
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on, and we'd understand very well. 
well
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well. 
well
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are. 
well
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers, some of them just making crap and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year, but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you, and try and do a good job in that one brief moment." 
 just 
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well, and call them out, and find out what those techniques are. 
well
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. 
well
There's a lot more problems like that -- AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited, just at the very name of these things. 
 just 
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen. 
you know
I was asked, I guess about six years ago, to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca. 
i guess
And these, I'll just show these without comment. 
 just 
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro, who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance, and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince." 
 just 
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero, this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat. 
 just 
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable. 
well
 Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money. 
you know
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy. 
well
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?" 
well
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old, like this." 
i guess
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see, you remember that old thing I discarded? 
you see
Well, I found a way to use it. 
well
 Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things. 
well
And as you know, you have to have a front. 
you know
I mean -- you've got to be confident; if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it? 
i mean
And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square? 
 just 
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever." 
well
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, and tell us to just go shopping. 
 just 
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital. 
well
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors, doesn't just make people feel a little better, it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well. 
well
Let me just give you a few examples, first of rules and the war on moral skill. 
 just 
Well, not always. 
well
I'll just give you one example because time is racing. 
 just 
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed. 
well
Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated, "We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'" And when professions are demoralized, everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives and they stop asking "Is it right?" 
 just 
Well, acknowledge them. 
well
One was Ray Anderson, who turned --  -- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business. 
you know
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work. 
well
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill. 
 just 
And, by the way, the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday. 
by the way
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep, and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want -- you've just got to say no. 
 just 
Your 401 just got nailed. 
 just 
And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States, we'd better deal with this stuff. 
 just 
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards. 
 just 
I mean, you're born with no teeth. 
i mean
I mean, you understand where this story's going. 
i mean
But, I mean it gets more interesting. 
i mean
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart, leaving just the cartilage. 
 just 
And this stuff is moving very quickly, and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight. 
by the way
And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear -- I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right? 
i mean
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones, and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner, and now we have these little buds that nobody sees. 
i mean
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can. 
well
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can, they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk, or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales. 
well
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition, and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can. 
well
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel. 
well
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware, more noble and more just society. 
 just 
It does concern you, as well. 
well
Well, now is that time. 
well
 Did I say that? I guess I did. 
i guess
I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. 
you see
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. 
i mean
And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. 
 just 
not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. 
 just 
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. 
 just 
And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. 
i suppose
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space. 
well
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances, and theirs might be as well. 
well
We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years, including the small planet, announced earlier this week, which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth. 
 just 
Well, what about 10^22? 
well
Life happened very quickly, and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos. 
well
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well. 
well
So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres," and by taking the Earth out of the center, and putting the sun in the center of the solar system, he opened our eyes to a much larger universe, of which we are just a small part. 
 just 
And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are, the targets for SETI's searches. 
 just 
Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year, and four of the respondents said, "SETI." 
well
Well, to quote: "The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception. 
well
And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved. 
well
but you seem to have more hair. 
you see
Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century, and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s, with Ron Howard as the director. 
well
We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up, particularly in close-up. 
 just 
Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly. 
you know
 You know, this is some tough stuff. 
you know
Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things. 
you know
And we were now well out of our comfort zone, and in uncharted territory. 
well
And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us. 
you see
And the software would tell us that, well, in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here, and it concludes moving in frame 32. 
well
 The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides. 
 just 
We found the old adage, you know, "The eyes are the window to the soul," absolutely true. 
you know
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology "emotion capture," as opposed to just motion capture. 
 just 
Brad Pitt: Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon, but ... maybe not. 
well
You know, we had to be taught we developed during the Great Depression and World War II. 
you know
I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time, -- a little over 200 feet -- and, I had caught this little fish here. 
 just 
I'm not just an ichthyologist, I'm a bona fide fish nerd. 
 just 
The first thing I learned -- well, I'm mortal, that's a really big one. 
well
But, this is really just the tip of the iceberg. 
 just 
I'll get into why that is in just a minute. 
 just 
So, the bottom line is that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below 500 feet. 
well
So, I'm just going to show you a basic idea. 
 just 
The nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues, and that's all fine, that's how we're designed. 
 just 
And, sure enough, they dissolve into your blood, and into your tissues as well. 
well
Well, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also. 
well
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts, but, you know, you got to start somewhere. 
you know
Well, there are three main advantages to a rebreather. 
well
Well, in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood, and look underneath and see what's going on. 
well
Now, the counterlungs aren't high-tech, they're just simply flexible bags. 
 just 
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop. 
 just 
You need three of them, so that if one of them goes bad, you know which one it is. 
you know
And I can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting. 
 just 
We start up here on the boat, and for all this high-tech, expensive equipment, this is still the best way to get in the water -- just pfft! -- flop over the side of the boat. 
 just 
So, we drop in the water, and we just sort of go over the edge of this cliff, and then we just start dropping, dropping, dropping. 
 just 
It's really a very interesting -- you ever see "The Abyss" where Ed Harris, you know, he's sinking down along the side of the wall? 
you know
Now not all of it is new species -- like that fish you see with the white stripe, that's a known species. 
you see
It's not just fish, either. 
 just 
And those fishes that you see right now are new species. 
you see
But this is what it looks like, and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles. 
 just 
 So, we're down there, and this is at 400 feet -- that's looking straight up, by the way, so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is. 
by the way
And if you're a biologist and you know about sharks, and you want to assess, you know, how much jeopardy am I really in here, there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is -- Diver 1 : What kind of sharks? 
you know
As a fish nerd, I have to laugh, because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing -- we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy. 
you know
This one's -- you know, you can see how ugly it is. 
you know
Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing, just look at the monetary value of this thing. 
 just 
And I remember coming up from one of these deep dives, and I had this fog, and the narcosis takes a little while to, you know, fade away. 
you know
Sure enough, I had caught one -- I just completely forgot that I had caught one.  And so this one we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to. 
 just 
So that's it's official scientific name, in reference to its deep-dwelling habits. 
well
When we first found it, we weren't even sure what family this thing belonged to, so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish, because it looked like something out of one of those books. 
 just 
Well, it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds, one pebble at a time. 
well
It's not just new species: it's new behavior, it's new ecology it's all kind of new things. 
 just 
So, what I'm going to show you right now, very quickly, is just a sampling of a few of the new species we've discovered. 
 just 
What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding -- although as you can see that's pretty amazing, this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. 
 just 
And I'm going to just close on a very somber note. 
 just 
The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general, which is that we all have two goals. 
 just 
And the second goal, for those of us who have mastered that first goal, is to -- you know, you call it spiritual fulfillment, you can call it financial success, you can call it any number of different things. 
you know
So, I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest, he absolutely did. 
i guess
If you live your whole life in fear -- I mean, life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality. 
i mean
and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city. 
well
I was quite shocked by that, and thought to myself, "Well, OK then. 
well
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. 
well
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching. 
you see
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life. 
well
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table. 
you see
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture. 
i guess
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces. 
 just 
And because of that announcement, we got a big article in The New York Times, which led to more press, which led to more attention, and me deciding to become CEO of that company -- whereas I was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring. 
 just 
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup, where focus is so critical, but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company, thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side, and it ended up taking over not only the company, but my life for the next five or six years. 
 just 
But it wasn't just individuals. 
 just 
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well, and put a Twitter feed on the front page, and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well. 
well
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates -- interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water. 
well
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways, but it introduces new use cases as well. 
well
And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends. 
 just 
It's happened more and more lately, whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis. 
well
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter. 
 just 
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. 
 just 
CA: Just kidding. 
 just 
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. 
 just 
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy. 
 just 
Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team -- all this different stuff that I have to do, and sometimes it gets overwhelming. 
well
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters, or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves. 
well
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago. 
 just 
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. 
i mean
If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters, we can go into this hidden hallway, and I'll quickly just show you the interface. 
 just 
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know? 
you know
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain, and this is Matahari, her second son, which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy. 
by the way
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together, just now like victims for every baby, six have disappeared from the forest. 
 just 
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there. 
 just 
When I stood there in the grass, it's hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass. 
 just 
So we plant it later, along the waterways to filter the water, provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available. 
 just 
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months. 
 just 
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant, by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people. 
by the way
This is what it looks like: the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water, carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. 
 just 
What I really did was I just followed nature, and nature doesn't know monocultures, but a natural forest is multilayered. 
 just 
So, just like nature, we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that, we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then, what is just as important: get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours. 
 just 
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance, from the Urals up to England, you know how many? 
you know
On the top left, underneath those green stripes, you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. 
you see
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before. 
 just 
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. 
well
I'll just run them very quickly through. 
 just 
And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place, but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there. 
you see
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears, but afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes, you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area. 
you see
Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy of the intact primary forest, what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon. 
well
So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane were interested in, but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles, and they also help to keep our global climate stable. 
well
Here in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist, gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them. 
you know
And especially, you know, as a small brown woman in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country, far away from the areas of power and money, I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this? 
you know
Well, I think that I can do something. 
well
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make -- those videos and so forth -- you know, they don't reach everybody, and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia, and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to. 
you know
 -- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing. 
 just 
And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects, which is the generation of Canopy Confluences. 
 just 
I'll just give you a few examples. 
 just 
I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth -- an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor, I don't have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands. 
you know
Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses, and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild. 
well
We've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest, and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been. 
 just 
Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well, I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons. 
well
And I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?" 
well
I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it. 
 just 
Being an apprentice, you know, you do that. 
you know
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife. 
you know
And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know. 
you know
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive. 
 just 
A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp. 
well
Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK? 
you know
I mean, you know. 
you know
And I'm like, "I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it." 
 just 
And he said "Well, that's how we do it." 
well
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped. 
you know
He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking. 
you know
And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second. 
 just 
 And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like ...  Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up. 
 just 
How did -- you know -- I mean -- how did I get here? 
you know
 It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own: and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies, and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy. 
 just 
You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity. 
you know
The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK. 
you know
I mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right? 
i mean
You know? 
you know
Neo in "The Matrix," you know? 
you know
These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for. 
 just 
And, as I stood there, looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK. 
 just 
Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon? 
 just 
I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day. 
i mean
Because, dude, you know, four years." 
you know
You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around. 
you know
And now, when I talk about the show, I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it. 
 just 
I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not. 
 just 
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work. 
 just 
 You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right? 
you know
I mean, that's all I heard growing up. 
i mean
The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas. 
 just 
Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong? 
you know
I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say -- but what if it's really safety third? 
i mean
 No, I mean really. 
i mean
What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first. 
i mean
So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean. 
you know
You see him all the time. 
you see
I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message, what's really being said? 
i mean
I just know that that's a front in this war. 
 just 
And right here guys, Silicon Valley, I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now? 
i mean
So, we've got this new toolbox, you know. 
you know
And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin. 
 just 
So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor. 
i mean
I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little. 
you know
This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties like any other war. 
i suppose
They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation, like risk and responsibility, like peripetia and anagnorisis, like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore, and like my time that's gone. 
 just 
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ... 
well
I mean, it's just wonderful. 
 just 
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice. 
 just 
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at. 
 just 
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well. 
well
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts. 
 just 
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results. 
 oh 
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out. 
 just 
This is one through 20. Next," they just give you as many o's as there are pages. 
 just 
And it's just clever. 
 just 
Oh well, different story. 
well
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults. 
you know
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun. 
i mean
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking, I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down. 
you see
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. 
 just 
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life. 
well
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water. 
you know
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment. 
 just 
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water, by the way, because it recirculates the same dirty water. 
by the way
Well, this has emotions if you like, because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright." 
well
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars, but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention." 
you know
But that's reflective design as well. 
well
As opposed to this one, which is a pure behavioral watch, which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you. 
 just 
And some of you may argue, "Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?" 
well
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. 
 just 
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time. 
by the way
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror. 
 just 
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc. 
 just 
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures. 
 just 
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?" 
well
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon. 
by the way
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids, ages six to eight, at a children's museum, and I brought with me a bag full of legs, similar to the kinds of things you see up here, and had them laid out on a table for the kids. 
you see
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious about what they don't know, or don't understand, or is foreign to them. 
you know
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way, and maybe censors that natural curiosity, or you know, reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids. 
you know
 And just like that, I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled" to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. 
 just 
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call. 
well
And the conversation would go something like this, "You know Aimee, you're very attractive. 
you know
 I thought, "Well, that's amazing, because I don't feel disabled." 
well
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do. 
i mean
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts, but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have. 
i mean
You see any adults? 
you see
Well, lets go back to the 15th century. 
well
And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male, he's wild and fairly hungry. 
you see
And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play, but it's never just singularly one thing. 
 just 
And you may feel like this character, who is also just doing it for its own sake. 
 just 
Now JPL, NASA and Boeing, before they will hire a research and development problem solver -- even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech -- if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life, played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well. 
well
This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good. 
 ok 
Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long, but it's a fundamental part of the play scene. 
well
Well, a lot. 
well
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play, its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals. 
you know
So what will follow is a student-made film about just that. 
 just 
If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. 
 just 
And if you imagine a kid pretending to be King Kong, or a race car driver, or a fireman, they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know. 
you know
And this is where my chasing animals for four, five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now, which is that play has a biological place, just like sleep and dreams do. 
 just 
So it's not just something you do in your spare time. 
 just 
Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pens and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard." 
well
SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play. 
well
I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play. 
i mean
Well, it was basically frustration. 
well
It was just very frustrating. 
 just 
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky, say on the Internet, then life would be so much easier. 
 just 
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy. 
well
Well, some people did. 
well
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again. 
you know
I mean, it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away. 
i mean
Well, documents you read, OK? 
well
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. 
 just 
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules: first thing is that those HTTP names -- those things that start with "http:" -- we're using them not just for documents now, we're using them for things that the documents are about. 
 just 
Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships. 
 just 
It's not just a whole lot of other plants. 
 just 
It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is. 
 just 
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up, he noticed that Wikipedia -- you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it. 
you know
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes. 
well
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin, you'll end up pulling up these other things as well. 
well
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK? 
 just 
I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it, so that you also see how much unlocked potential. 
 just 
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important, but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. 
 just 
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging. 
you know
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather -- yes, make a beautiful website, who am I to say don't make a beautiful website? 
well
And it's not just America. It's all over the world. 
 just 
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well. 
well
In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another. 
 just 
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. 
well
You just -- you log on to your social networking site, your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend." 
 just 
I did that to the map. I just did that! 
 just 
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what? 
you know
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it. 
you know
I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together. 
 just 
And when you connect data together, you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents. 
 just 
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. 
 just 
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic, and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you. 
 just 
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it: "Test Two: Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No. 
you know
Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No. 
you know
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No. 
you know
A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. 
i mean
But Darwin shows that it’s just false. 
 just 
Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion, which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important. 
 just 
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector, because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer, to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar. 
 just 
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. 
by the way
But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this, that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find -- we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that. 
 oh 
Well now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it’s the same story, the same story. 
well
Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out, but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward. 
 just 
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way. 
 just 
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing. 
you know
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. 
 just 
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same. 
 just 
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people -- I mean, not terrible in this -- but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with, from another university, another group, all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up -- a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment -- and people cheat even less. 
i mean
They cheat just by a little bit. 
 just 
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you. 
you know
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition, and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions. 
 just 
Well, this isn't exactly true. 
well
I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself, and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible, the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there's an entire story here. 
 just 
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean, it couldn't be that difficult. 
i mean
what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality. 
you know
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton; I just noticed that as I finished this skull, the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be. 
 just 
And in this folder, "Creative Projects," there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on, projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day, and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. 
 just 
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different, that I -- you know, I have my own R2D2, but that's -- honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy. 
you know
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial, Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this -- I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation, but also a side, rear and other side elevation. 
 just 
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it, and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles. 
you know
So here I had this Falcon, and it was lovely. It looked really great, the light worked on it really well, it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world. 
well
It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade, make and travel in information about movie props. 
 just 
But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves, I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it. 
to be honest
This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days -- I had a huge collection of them from the '30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful. 
 just 
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go. 
you know
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way. 
by the way
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining, recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s, dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here, but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away. 
well
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940, when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere. 
 just 
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit, just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- "RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World." 
 just 
It's just a sick, silly joke. 
 just 
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi, and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi. 
 just 
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that, and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it." 
well
Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France -- sign of our times, I guess. 
i guess
And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet. 
you know
I would just like to add a crass commercial -- I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches," a compendium of all the serious play that ever was, and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores, tables on the street in October. 
 just 
But kites aren't just toys like this. 
 just 
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop! 
well
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too." 
well
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all." 
you know
I said, "Well what about your dreams?" 
well
And she said, "Well, you know, my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl. 
well
And in the middle of this economic crisis, where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear, I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out, recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary. 
well
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves. 
 just 
And I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?" 
 just 
You know, I found that volcano on Google Images, not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. 
you know
Now, it works just like a regular phone. 
 just 
So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone, but its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone, just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended. 
 just 
They've got every feature known to man in there, because adding a new feature is just software. 
 just 
I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore. 
i mean
I'm like, can you imagine being the T-Mobile PR lady? You know? 
you know
You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?" 
well
It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call. 
 just 
So what I mean is that you can start a call in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot, you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead -- which would be like 10 minutes --  And the call will continue to be free. 
i mean
Because they don't, they haven't -- well, no, wait! Not so fast. 
well
Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying, "Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?" 
 just 
No, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that. 
 just 
By the way, this is something that really bothers me. 
by the way
Did you know that? It's an outrage. 
you know
If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free. 
you know
And it's already written down -- so, like, if you're driving, you don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh." 
 uh 
Here we go. And those are just the beginning. 
 just 
That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me. 
 just 
They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing. 
 just 
Well anyway -- oh! Here we go! 
well
He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet. 
 just 
No, no, no -- just kidding, no no. 
 just 
It's just so amazing. 
 just 
I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive. 
 just 
I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like, when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?" 
you know
You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to make money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line. 
you know
You know. It's just absolutely amazing. 
you know
I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?" 
 just 
I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in. 
you know
Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good. 
well
 What the f -- z  Well I guess that was the gist. 
well
 And lastly, I just have to talk about this one. 
 just 
The really beautiful thing is, you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller. 
you know
Phone: Well, that's good. 
well
Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to. 
 just 
DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot. 
 oh 
Phone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier? 
well
Phone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but --  I think the biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone. 
well
- you know. I'm not. 
you know
You know how you erase it? 
you know
This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio -- you type in a band or a song name. 
 just 
Anyway, just amazing, amazing things. 
 just 
Of course, its not just about the iPhone. 
 just 
 Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand. 
 just 
Concerns -- I have a few. It's got some flaws; we may just face it. 
 just 
I coined my own definition of success in 1934, when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana, being a little bit disappointed, and [disillusioned] perhaps, by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes expected their youngsters to get an A or a B. 
by the way
I wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher, and give the youngsters under my supervision, be it in athletics or the English classroom, something to which to aspire, other than just a higher mark in the classroom, or more points in some athletic contest. 
 just 
I'm sure at the time he did that, I didn't -- it didn't -- well, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind, it popped out years later. 
well
Well, that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters. 
well
Then I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks, and thought, it's not right for me to keep this other [rule] so I let them just -- they had to be neat and clean. 
 just 
Most of them are young, you know, and probably newly-married. 
you know
Not just give it word service, believe that things will work out as they should, providing we do what we should. 
 just 
You know, a number of years ago, there was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty. 
 um
And I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game. 
 just 
I used to say that when a game is over, and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome, I hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you. 
you see
And I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA: to get an education, he was a good student, really knew why he was there in the first place. 
well
 I'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends, too. 
well
Why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that. 
 just 
And you know, one of them was a starting player for a season and a half. 
you know
Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well. 
well
And neither one could jump very well, but they kept good position, and so they did well rebounding. 
well
One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. 
you see
We look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans. 
well
And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals, but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis. 
 just 
There's at least three viruses that you know about, which are in this particular monkey. 
you know
NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game. 
 just 
Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder -- this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that I showed you. 
 just 
You know, take a look at his face. 
you know
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites; I figured, no problem. 
you know
One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field. 
 just 
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu. 
you see
Needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct. 
well
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa. 
 just 
But really, this is just the beginning from our perspective. 
 just 
If an intelligent extra-terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet, 27 out of 30 of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus, with just a few of the volumes left for plants, fungus and animals, humans being a footnote; interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless. 
 just 
In those days, one hid much else as well: grown men didn't embrace one another, unless someone had died, and not always then; you shook hands or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection; once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek, not until mores at last had evolved, and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment, 
well
We knew so little in those days, as little as now, I suppose about healing those hurts: even the women, in their best dresses, with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices, even in lipstick and mascara, their hair aflow, could only stand wringing their hands, begging for peace, while father and son, like thugs, like thieves, like Romans, simmered and hissed and hated, inflicting sorrows that endured, the worst anyway, 
i suppose
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell. 
well
 Wouldn't it be nice, I think, when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts, just a little, and violently blushes. 
 just 
And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was 12, and a splendid piebald stallion, who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that, though more hugely of course, enormous, gleaming, resplendent. 
 just 
 I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that. 
 just 
I like to just end. 
 just 
What I mean is the world holds me so tightly -- the good and the bad -- my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit Venus with her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped with gel, so moves me my breath catches. 
i mean
"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"  And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day. 
 just 
You can see on a graph, after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow, just after redesign. 
 just 
Design was just a part of the process. 
 just 
Why am I asking all of these business questions, instead of just showing them pages? 
 just 
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product. 
 just 
You just need inspiration, vision and determination. 
 just 
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider, with the possibility to fly cross-country, distance, just with the use of thermals to soar. 
 just 
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body. 
 just 
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit, I can make it fly. And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface. 
you see
UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute just seconds before, I would say, impact. 
 just 
JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions. 
well
UE: Nope. It's just smoke. 
 just 
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards. 
 just 
UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and --  JC: ...a round of applause... 
 oh 
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. 
 just 
They came to me and said, "Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? 
well
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?" 
you know
And I said, "Well, not in that interior." 
well
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding." 
 oh 
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit. 
 just 
Unfortunately, this particular call would not end well. 
well
The chief's letter went, not to some farmhouse in Iowa like you see in the old war movies, but went to the iRobot Company, which is named after the Asimov novel and the not-so-great Will Smith movie, and... um... ... 
 um
What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. 
 just 
It's just to give you a taste. 
 just 
But it may be even bigger than that, because our unmanned systems don't just affect the "how" of war-fighting, they affect the "who" of fighting at its most fundamental level. 
 just 
they think about our systems, and what I found interesting is not just their stories, but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society, in our law and our ethics, etc. And so what I'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these. 
 just 
But just as software has gone open-source, so has warfare. 
 just 
One of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone, the handheld tossed one. For about a thousand dollars, you can build one yourself, equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq. 
 just 
So they don't just delink the public: they reshape its relationship with war. 
 just 
But remember, this is taking place in our strange, weird world, and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to, you know, your iPod or your Zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. 
you know
It was set to the pop song "I Just Want To Fly" by Sugar Ray. 
 just 
But we have to remember, these are just the clips. 
 just 
These are just the ESPN SportsCenter version of the game. They lose the context. 
 just 
They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. 
 just 
"This is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel Israelis and Americans, who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us. 
 just 
They don't want to fight us like real men, but they're afraid to fight, so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them." 
 just 
We're gaining incredible new capabilities, but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas. Now, sometimes these are just "oops" moments, which is what the head of a robotics company described it, you just have "oops" moments. Well, what are "oops" moments with robots in war? 
well
Well, sometimes they're funny. Sometimes, they're like that scene from the Eddie Murphy movie "Best Defense," playing out in reality, where they tested out a machine gun-armed robot, and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of VIPs. 
well
They see an 80-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T-80 tank: they're both just a series of zeroes and ones. 
 just 
And so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your Roomba sucking the life away from you. 
well
Then it's just a product recall issue." 
 just 
And so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil, but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well. 
well
There are two clips I want to show you, the first one is a kind of hodgepodge, its just three little moments, four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight. 
 just 
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it, it was built entirely by hand, I think they got a crane the last year. 
you see
Think about that when you see that building, that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. 
you see
And I came home and I said to my father and mother, "I just met this man: doesn't have much work, and he's sort of ugly, funny voice, and he's a teacher at school. 
 just 
I know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him, because he's really an amazing man." 
 just 
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go. 
you know
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. 
you know
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station, it was so consistent with his life, you know? 
you know
I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane, or I'm going to die in an airport, or die jogging without an identification on me. 
i mean
NK: Do you know anything about the architect? 
you know
NK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son, he was my father. 
well
In social aspect of his life he was just like a child, he was not at all matured. 
 just 
You see, only that way you can be able to understand him. 
you see
And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing; it's not just wisdom or guesswork. 
 just 
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics, we need to look at this in a rigorous way. 
 just 
You know, what if people are rational? 
you know
That is, they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest. 
 just 
If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States we would like to think, may have some influence -- certainly the president in Iran has some influence -- but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran, or about energy policy, or about health care, or about any particular policy. 
 just 
There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome, not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid. 
 just 
There's a good reason that we don't do that, and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers, we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people. 
 just 
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers. 
 just 
So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have, what the chances are that they're willing to take, what they're after, what they value, what they want, and what they believe about other people. 
 just 
So you can see here on the vertical axis, I haven't shown it all the way down to zero, there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction, so I've narrowed the scale. 
 just 
The white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions, under its own domestic political pressures. 
 just 
Take a look at these guys, they're growing in power, and by the way, this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis, and that's probably going to get steeper. 
by the way
They are growing in political clout, as the mullahs are isolating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mullahs, who are not well known to Americans. 
well
And the reason that being able to predict those things is important, is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it, but because if you can predict what people will do, you can engineer what they will do. 
 just 
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though, just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result. 
 just 
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place. 
well
They just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life, except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters. 
 just 
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life. 
well
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well. 
well
I mean they're incredibly small, you have to have a microscope to see one. 
i mean
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals. 
 just 
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium, a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean, named Vibrio fischeri. 
 just 
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones, and these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light. 
 just 
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii, just in sort of shallow knee-deep water. 
 just 
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water. 
 just 
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this. 
 just 
So then we started to look at other bacteria, and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered. 
 just 
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin. 
 just 
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well. 
well
Of course, you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics. 
 just 
We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications, just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count, and they don't know to launch virulence. 
well
To finish I'll just show you the strategy. 
 just 
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule, but the logic is exactly the same. 
 just 
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal, in this case, a mouse, it doesn't initiate virulence right away. 
you know
What I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other, they use chemicals as their words, they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about. 
 just 
We know that the principles and the rules, if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms, the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well. 
well
Again, we think that bacteria invented that, and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles, but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study. 
 just 
The final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part, and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics. 
 just 
I hope when you learn things, like about how the natural world works -- I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child. 
 just 
I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age, and it's just a crazy delightful job. 
 just 
I am going to talk about myself, which I rarely do, because I -- well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about. 
well
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always two percent. 
you know
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons, that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology -- because for instance, the reason I don't do math is, I was taught to do math and read at the same time. 
you know
One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument. 
 just 
Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today, that mind-body split, you know? 
well
 But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 
 just 
I don't know if you know this but -- maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country, until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin, the signs over the little boys cribs read, "I'm a boy," and the signs over the little girls cribs read, "It's a girl." Yeah. 
you know
And well, yeah. 
well
Well, 58 percent said yes, which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say, "Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!" 
well
 Maybe too far. But you know -- I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color. 
you know
 When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal, and everything else, were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. 
you know
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody. 
i suppose
 I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know? 
you know
I mean he had laid it all out. 
i mean
 And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know? 
you know
  And you know people, this is the problem with quote, objectivity, unquote. 
you know
Like economists, you know, their definition of rational, that we all act out of our own economic self-interest. 
you know
Well, look at Michael Hawley, or look at Dean Kamen, or look at my grandmother. 
well
 There the alternative just boggles the imagination. 
 just 
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five, if that's OK with you. 
 ok 
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place. 
 just 
You know, the toes of the gecko, curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen. 
you know
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up, which explains the whole SUV phenomenon. 
i guess
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity. 
well
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes. 
you know
You know we're being penetrated. 
you know
You know, make you not follow your usual train of association, but make you rewire. 
you know
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible, "Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?" 
 just 
 I just want to say two more things. 
 just 
And you know the biggest hurdle for me, in doing what I do, is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared. 
you know
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop. 
 just 
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater, when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work. 
 just 
And so it's sort of a mini well. 
well
We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car. 
well
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car. 
well
I was running, as Chris said, to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP And then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?" 
well
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. 
well
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground. 
well
You think, well it's been up, it's been down, its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down. 
well
You know what happens at that point? 
you know
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world. 
 oh 
Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline. 
 just 
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it. 
 just 
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves. 
 just 
The business model in which the money that is actually coming in, to drive the car -- the minutes, the miles if you want, that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car, just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles. 
 just 
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up, instead of digging down. 
well
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars -- 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. 
 just 
And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it. 
well
We need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil. 
 just 
I'm just going to talk -- about where that's likely to carry us. 
 just 
And you know, I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions. 
you know
Life is short, you know. 
you know
And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil, so is Eric Drexler. 
you know
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project. 
 just 
You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL. 
you know
So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now, we'll look back at this instant in time, and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project, and what all this is going to mean to us -- well, it will really mean precious little. 
well
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case. 
 just 
If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives, you just have to go to any major city. 
 just 
I mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast-forward. 
 just 
And it's going to be used for diet as well, and nutritional supplements and such. 
well
Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge. 
 just 
And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about, and between subpopulations of humans as well. 
well
I mean Ritalin, Viagra, things of that sort, Prozac. 
i mean
You know, this is just clumsy little baby steps. 
you know
What if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented, just happy to be you. 
 just 
As that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization, to the wealthy who want to protect their children, to just about everybody else. 
 just 
And in that process that's going to morph from being just for diseases, to being for lesser vulnerabilities, like risk of manic depression or something, to picking personalities, temperaments, traits, these sorts of things. 
 just 
But ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere. 
 just 
Some people are going to see this as an abomination, as the worst thing, as just awful. 
 just 
But this whole effort is generated, is driven, by IT as well because that is how we're gathering all this information, and linking it, and integrating it together. 
well
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well. 
well
In fact this isn't just abstract. 
 just 
I just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging, and we're making some real progress. 
 just 
If you look forward, I mean future humans, far before the end of this millennium, in a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment. 
i mean
You know it's a little bit like a birth. 
you know
And what's extraordinary is that we're not just observing this, we are the architects of this. 
 just 
You see 12 intelligent computer agents, the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. 
you see
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists. 
you see
 Obviously, you see the resemblance. 
you see
Then you see his left leg. 
you see
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll, and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water. 
 just 
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think, all things considered. 
well
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay, eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus, Traditional Japanese." And so on. 
okay
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things -- and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important. 
well
But no, you'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things -- pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps. 
well
"Okay, come on, grab me." 
okay
That's just one benefit of that. 
 just 
With this, typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing. 
 just 
Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash, they get 15 feet up -- and they can do about 15 pull-ups right -- And then they just flame out. 
 just 
Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen, you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you're going to fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can actually control the fall. 
you know
I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it, you can have a little bit of it." 
well
The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef. 
well
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs, is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry. 
you see
One. Great. Okay. 
okay
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth. 
 just 
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs." 
well
But what we want to propose, is that the highest levels of abstraction, things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. -- all of this can be engaged with, not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods, but by literally, physically playing with ideas. 
 just 
And of course, in a way, when I say romance, I mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation. 
i mean
You know, from a romance language. 
you know
So that it was something that just got into your spirit. 
 just 
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes. 
 just 
Well the act of drawing airplanes led me to, when I had the opportunity to choose a course in school, led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering. 
well
One day a young man looked over my shoulder, he said, "You draw very well. 
well
And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there." 
well
Studied painting; didn't do very well at that. 
well
Any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday? -- at the track, you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars. 
you know
Well in 25 years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature. 
well
But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow. 
you know
 So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it." 
well
Well, that's typical of a lot of us working in chairs. 
well
And so after many trials, many failures, we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other. 
 just 
 Just your own. 
 just 
Well if you're reclined a great deal, you have to use muscle force to hold your head there. 
well
Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it'll fit, you know, a tall guy and a short girl. 
you know
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well. 
well
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton -- the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96, you see real big differences in this part of the country right here, the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it: 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did in 2008. 
you see
So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know. 
you know
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas. 
well
So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. 
you see
Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list. 
you see
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened" but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted, I suppose, manifestation of racially-based voting. 
you know
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here. 
you see
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand, and Kentucky? 
 just 
And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships, one of which is education, where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. It's just a fact. 
you see
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns. 
you see
But you see Democrats versus Republican, not a big difference based on who your neighbors are. 
you see
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem." 
you see
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose, ideas for maybe how to do that. 
i suppose
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year. 
 just 
We're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world, as well as the developing world. 
well
This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai. 
 just 
So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now. 
 just 
You see this with Twitter, too. You get this information overload. 
you see
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods. 
you know
Here is just a little bit of data. 
 just 
And by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low. 
i mean
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well. 
well
Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas, how do we maximize that incentive? 
well
Well how else can we create new ideas? 
well
Well, more idea creators. 
well
Here is just some data. This is China. 
 just 
Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression. 
well
So we might engage a rat, for example, to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub-skills, or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read. 
 just 
So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound, a repertoire of sound that I make up, that I make, just by exposure, artificially important to the animal and its young brain. 
 just 
Now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops, and elaborates their skills and abilities, but also try to understand the origins of impairment, and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult. 
 just 
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay? 
okay
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon, about 35 years ago, that if you simply fix the problem early enough, when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately, in this initial set up time in the critical period, none of that happens. 
well
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear. 
 just 
And children operating in various language behaviors, or in various reading behaviors, you see for the most extent, for most children, their neuronal responses, complexly abnormal before you start, are normalized by the training. 
you see
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory, of their ability to remember things after a delay, of their ability to control their attention, their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities. 
you see
And of course, a well-ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key. 
well
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future, just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period. 
well
Now that you know, now that science is telling us that you are in charge, that it's under your control, that your happiness, your well-being, your abilities, your capacities, are capable of continuous modification, continuous improvement, and you're the responsible agent and party. 
well
Okay. Thank you. 
okay
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here, I thought to myself that well, it's TED. 
well
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world. 
you know
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because, after all, this is the great unveiling. 
 just 
I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves. 
i suppose
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows, allow me to play with the spaces between those questions. 
well
 Okay. Okay. Oh, well. 
well
Hi sweetheart. Okay. 
okay
Well you know, she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her. 
well
And you know what that means, of course. 
you know
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know. 
you know
 So many others you see, they're just wonderful. 
you see
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know. 
you know
You know, she's only half Jewish. 
you know
Did you know that about her? 
you know
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent.  And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling. 
you know
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel. 
 just 
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl. 
you know
You know, your parents must be very proud. 
you know
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people. 
you know
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah. 
okay
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things. 
you know
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know. 
you know
But anyway, you know, I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future. 
you know
You know, it's heartening to me. 
you know
You know, between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about. 
you know
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way: the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know, the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it. 
well
My name is Noraida. And I'm just -- I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that. 
 just 
And I think he's Mexican, so that's -- honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --  I just -- I'm sorry. 
 just 
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything. 
 just 
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking. 
you know
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath. 
 just 
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes. 
you know
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better. 
you know
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath. 
 just 
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED. 
okay
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED. 
you know
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like, you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know, which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that. 
you know
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization, which is like a leadership thing, you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything. 
you know
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there. 
you know
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted. 
 just 
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me, like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning. 
 just 
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that, it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know. 
you know
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else. 
 just 
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED. 
 just 
  So, that was Noraida, and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today, these are folks who are based on real people from my real life: friends, neighbors, family members. 
 just 
In fact, the older lady you just met: very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side. 
 just 
But on top of my family background, my parents also sent me to the United Nations school, where I encountered a plethora of new characters, including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay. 
okay
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know. 
well
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French]. 
you know
It was like, you know, she was there in the class, you know, she was kind of typically French. 
you know
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know. 
you know
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know, talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know. 
you know
Although, you know, it was wonderful. 
you know
Never. He always, always treated each of us, you know, equally unbearably during the class. 
you know
And they've inspired many characters as well. 
well
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening. 
well
But, you know, I am originally from India, and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California, originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved because, you know, I am a human rights advocate. 
you know
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.  So, you can just imagine -- right. 
 just 
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great. 
okay
Uh, well, thank you. 
well
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED, I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know -- before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people, much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking. 
well
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, I try anyway. 
 just 
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them, and they would always answer me back in English. 
you know
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls. 
i mean
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception --  -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem. 
 just 
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please. 
well
Okay? Great. 
okay
 Well, you have to let me say this. 
well
I just -- thank you. 
 just 
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here. 
 just 
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all, at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine for more than 260 million people. 
well
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human, the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter -- let's shut down the airports. 
 just 
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something. 
well
Well how good a city council you have, how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge. 
well
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work if their kids aren't in school. 
well
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting. 
well
What they found was, the core functions -- you know you still sort of had banks, but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines. 
you know
And that's just office workers, bankers. 
 just 
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time, well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations. 
well
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is, I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything -- for yourself, your family, or your employees -- unless you've really done your homework. 
well
Well if you think it's going to last 18 months, are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks for every single person in your family? 
well
Everybody has come up to me and said, well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you. 
well
But I guess the other thing to add is, if you do have employees, and you do have a company, I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them, and you are trying to plan. 
i guess
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can. 
well
You know way more than any of us. 
you know
LG: The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission. 
you see
Not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing sister or brother, but a community infected -- spread within a school, spread within a dormitory, something of that nature. 
 just 
I mean 100 percent death rate is pretty severe. 
i mean
LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know what the lethality was of the 1918 strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans. 
 um
And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS. 
 just 
So as a naive New Zealander I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon. 
well
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily, we just have to know how to pull it out. 
 just 
You see some sort of random distribution -- perhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed, or 47 attacks where seven people were killed. 
you see
"When God made the color purple, God was just showing off," Alice Walker wrote in "The Color Purple," and Zora Neale Hurston wrote in "Dust Tracks On A Road," "Research is a formalized curiosity. 
 just 
And then finally, when I think about the near future, you know, we have this attitude, well, whatever happens, happens. Right? 
well
 If we describe the near future as 10, 20, 15 years from now, that means that what we do today is going to be critically important, because in the year 2015, and the year 2020, 2025, the world our society is going to be building on, the basic knowledge and abstract ideas, the discoveries that we came up with today, just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference 
 just 
That's the substrate that we're exploiting today, whether it's the internet, genetic engineering, laser scanners, guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition television, sensing, remote-sensing from space and the wonderful remote-sensing photos that we see in 3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker, and Enterprise, CD rewrite drives, flatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis, or Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs," which by the way was banned by the FCC, or ska, all of these things 
by the way
What is our mission? What do we have to do? I think our mission is to reconcile, to reintegrate science and the arts, because right now in popular culture. You know, people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate. 
you know
Now I know no one here at TED thinks this. All of us, we already know that they're very connected, but I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world, believe it or not, they think it's neat when they say, "You know, scientists and science is not creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious, but they're not creative. 
you know
Then they're going to go to something where they think, "Well, I can be creative and logical at the same time." 
well
You see, I always assumed I would go into space, because I followed all of this, but I also loved the arts and sciences. 
you see
You see, when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager, I loved designing and making dogs' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer. 
you see
And yeah, sub-atomic physics is deconstructive. You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them. But sculpture, from what I understand from great sculptors, is deconstructive, because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there. 
you see
It's not just the tools, it's not just the sciences, you know, the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics, because we heard, very much on this stage, people talked about music being mathematical. Right? Arts don't just use clay, aren't the only ones that use clay, light and sound and movement. 
you know
They use analysis as well. 
well
So people might say, well, I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing, because everybody wants to do the right brain, left brain thing, right? 
well
We've all been accused of being right-brained or left-brained at some point in time, depending on who we disagreed with.  You know, people say intuitive, you know that's like you're in touch with nature, in touch with yourself and relationships. 
you know
And then you have artists, and you all know this is true as well, artists will say things about scientists because they say they're too concrete, they're disconnected with the world. 
well
That's a foolish choice. It's foolish, just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic. 
 just 
You need both in life. Why do people do this? I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner, who's 70 years old so he can say this. He said, "It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence." 
 just 
Now...  I want to share with you a little equation, okay? 
okay
There are some ideas that emerged that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts. The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders is very different than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s and the '70s when we emerged as world leaders, because we're no longer in competition with fascism, with Soviet-style communism, and by the way 
by the way
that competition wasn't just military, it included social competition and political competition as well, that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms to prove that our social system was better. 
well
Another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences is becoming obsolete. We look at universities and colleges, small, mid-sized community colleges across the country, their laboratories are becoming obsolete, and this is where we train most of our science workers and our researchers, and our teachers, by the way, and then that there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than the most mundane and inane of information. 
by the way
We have to pay attention to it. I just want to tell you really quickly what I'm doing. 
 just 
One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well. My mother always told me, you have to be observant, know what's going on in your mind and your body, and as a dancer I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body, just as I knew how to sense colors. 
well
Then I went to medical school, and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies. 
 just 
You know, you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you, "Don't, don't, don't listen to what the patients said." We know that patients know and understand their bodies better, but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea. We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body with physician's measurements. 
you know
We need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today, we need to take responsibility for the future. We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits, or it's just a business, or I'm an artist or an academician. 
 just 
But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without, um -- oops. 
 um
So this is just floating, floating on a permanent magnetic field, which stabilizes it in all directions. 
 just 
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball, right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty. 
 just 
This would be grown, I suppose, with nanotechnology in the future sometime. 
i suppose
And some of it is just the idea of creating media -- media as a sculpture, something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever-changing, by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. 
 just 
I had thought about, a long time ago, in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out, I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations -- and other things that were happening, the space program at that time, and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that. 
 just 
The idea of this air genie is, it's something that can just transform and become anything. 
 just 
Okay. Thank you. 
okay
Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all? 
okay
 Okay, now the question is really, why is this so? 
okay
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history. 
well
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics. 
well
The costs have been tremendous -- water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats. 
you know
How many of you actually can make a bread in this way, without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor? 
 just 
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs? We have become very removed from what our bread really is, which, again, evolutionarily speaking, is very strange. 
you know
In fact not many of you know that our bread, of course, was not a European invention. 
you know
We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem. 
 just 
If we say just small-scale production, as is the tendency here, to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges. 
 just 
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice, 150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it. 
 just 
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing: if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale. 
 just 
What you see is that we've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture, which was sort of small-scale and low-control. 
you see
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields, but in terms of the entire food network. 
 just 
Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies. 
well
And within just a couple years, San Francisco became the first no-kill city, running no deficit, completely supported by the community. 
 just 
And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough." 
 just 
And, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either. 
well
 You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one. 
you know
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need, I don't know, a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round. 
 just 
You know, this is one of my favorite devices. 
you know
But let me just try a couple. 
 just 
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me." 
 just 
You just need a few people --  -- who will look at the rules, realize they make no sense, and realize how much they want to be connected. 
 just 
We're just waiting for someone to lead us." 
 just 
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes. 
well
Do you know what people want more than anything? 
you know
And, up there, you see Uganda. 
you see
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better, it's just that they have stopped getting worse. 
 just 
So, when we look at the pattern, one thing comes out very clearly: you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. 
you see
Well if you look at the macro level, it seems more money, more HIV. 
well
Well, it is more common with multiple partners, there is less condom use, and there is age-disparate sex -- that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women. 
well
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know? 
you know
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see. 
you see
You know if you look at the development in the West over 200 years, the average growth may have been about two percent. 
you know
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth. 
by the way
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation," what I meant by the "go to jail" remark, I offered that theft is a crime. 
i mean
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation, impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population, affluence and technology. 
well
So we set out at Interface, in 1994, to create an example: to transform the way we made carpet, a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy, and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact, rather than multiplied it. 
well
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004, meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain, from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -- independent third-party certified. 
well
Our products are the best they've ever been, inspired by design for sustainability, an unexpected wellspring of innovation. 
well
You know that would reframe civilization itself --  -- and our whole system of economics, if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us: the sustainable species, living on a finite earth, ethically, happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations, or 10,000 generations -- But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species? 
you know
Well maybe so. But I don't think so. 
well
Tomorrow's child, my daughter, son, I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good, though always having known I should. 
 just 
Well, every day of my life since, "Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me with one simple but profound message, which I presume to share with you. 
well
You know, I don't know how many of those you read, but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write. 
you know
So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --" I had a sabbatical. I said, "I'll write about my research, if there's no other way. 
okay
And even being here -- I mean, the last few days, I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about. 
i mean
 Which I think is just fascinating. 
 just 
I guess maybe if you're colorblind, I don't think you can see that. 
i guess
By the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story. 
by the way
You see, the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group. 
you see
You know the expression, "Begging only gets you so far." 
you know
So a standard economist, somebody who believes in rationality, would say, "You know what? The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a "V" is higher than the possible benefit of the decision, so that's why we get this effect." 
you know
And because we have no idea what to do, we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us. 
 just 
People who are well-paid, experts in their decisions, and who make a lot of them?" 
well
Hip replacement. Okay?" 
okay
I hope this worries you, by the way --  when you go to see your physician. 
by the way
The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior, and not just to Rome without coffee -- even superior to Paris. 
 just 
The general idea here, by the way, is that we actually don't know our preferences that well. 
well
And because we don't know our preferences that well, we're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces: the defaults, the particular options that are presented to us, and so on. 
well
 The second point, or course, is that if somebody invites you to bar hop, you know what they think about you. 
you know
 Okay. Now on the left you can see the hand -- that's the big arrow -- and the penis on the right. The hand hovering. 
okay
No. It was the whole, you know, motion. 
you know
And she said, "Yeah, but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind." 
you know
And I said to her, "Are you just doing this all the time?" 
 just 
You know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university." 
you know
 This is a guy writing a book, "Ideal Marriage," you know. 
you know
 Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel, a man began hiccupping. 
okay
 If you go all the way back to Hippocrates, physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception, but necessary. 
 just 
 My favorite being the one that says -- you know, they have the ingredients listed, and then in a recipe it will say, for example, "Yield: two dozen cupcakes." 
you know
 Okay. 
okay
 So, okay. 
okay
He's going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay. 
okay
There is a point in this video, towards the beginning, where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring, as if to say, "It's okay, it's just his job. He really does like women." 
 just 
 Okay. When I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie. 
okay
And I said, "So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig? 
 just 
She said, "It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva. 
 just 
So possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks. 
you know
And I also said to her, "Now, these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there. 
i mean
 Masters and Johnson. In the 1950s, they decided, okay, we're going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle, from arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women -- everything that happens in the human body. 
okay
Okay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside. 
okay
This just kills me, not because I wanted to use it -- I wanted to see it. 
 just 
 And in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out. 
 just 
However, the record holder landed just shy of the eight-foot mark, which is impressive. 
 just 
And seen just recently in late 2008, here is that region again, now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. 
 just 
The sales person that -- the customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are." 
okay
You know what? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. 
you know
Okay, religious mania: there's rapture, there's weeping, there's visions. 
okay
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant, with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America, and you, just getting through school, I want you to know that we have very much in common. 
 just 
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder. 
 just 
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine, and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother: things like compassion, and integrity, and confidence, and perseverance -- all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give. 
well
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well, including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers. 
well
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well. 
well
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation and generations to come. 
 just 
You too can realize your dreams, and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing. 
 just 
And its name, Resolute, is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country, but to live a life of purpose, as well. 
well
And then we grow these things, and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from, "Look, actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later, but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants." 
 just 
These are not just crop plants, as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway -- fantastic work there. 
 just 
You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel -- that is, until your first encounter The progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one. 
you know
You are not the first to try to figure this out, just as you are unlikely to be the last. 
 just 
Even more valuable, history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual, as well as the intended consequences of ideas. 
well
And it's not just computation. 
 just 
And it doesn't just apply to computation. 
 just 
I mean this went through thick and thin, through war and peace, through boom times and recessions. 
i mean
And I just updated these graphs. 
 just 
And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous? 
well
And halfway through the project, skeptics said, "Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project and you've finished one percent of the project." 
well
Some critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud." 
well
Well this is a logarithmic graph. 
well
You know the problem; we don't want to believe what we know. 
you know
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful. 
you see
At the moment, my family is very poor, my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on. 
 just 
For the past 30 years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. 
well
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet. 
well
 Um, there are -- I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses. 
 um
Okay, I was ill. 
okay
Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know. 
you know
I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever. 
you know
I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman, who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room. 
you know
Because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience, although you guys can not only go to the moon, you know, you're going to totally transform everything. 
you know
But I'm moving past Malthus, because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment. 
 just 
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony, leading to people hopefully using these products across the world. 
 just 
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science. 
 just 
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum, you know, CO2 generated. Right? 
you know
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented. 
you see
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. 
well
Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring. 
well
Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879. 
well
Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA, roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. 
okay
And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition, the 2009 CES Innovation Award. 
 just 
Well, we certainly try. 
well
It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world. 
 just 
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust, well you really need a lot of positives to upset that. 
well
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings. 
 just 
And of course we know this intuitively, that happiness is not just the absence of misery. 
 just 
We use this word "happy," and it's this very large umbrella of a term. 
 um
There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes, and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. 
 just 
Let's just go into the brain for a moment, and see where does happiness arise from in evolution. 
 just 
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times. 
 just 
So they assumed this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron. 
you know
It makes something look so attractive that you just have to go after it. 
 just 
The pleasure system, as you see, which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin, is widely spread throughout the brain. 
you see
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major. 
 just 
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother, will show this particular kind of smile. 
you see
There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex. 
 just 
So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction, you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income. 
you see
You see mental distress going up with lower income. 
you see
So to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so. 
 just 
And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in, you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected, before the change, and much more post-materialist values after. 
you see
Man: How do you know? 
you know
Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot, Stickybot, using a new hierarchical dry adhesive. 
well
And if you look, you can see that it uses the toe peeling, just like the gecko does. 
 just 
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. 
you see
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature, this kind of thing happens. 
 just 
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail." 
well
Well we know that tails store fat, for example. 
well
And perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance. 
well
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there. 
you see
And then of course we wondered, okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them. 
okay
You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies. 
you know
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right, we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot. 
okay
Okay, there it goes. 
okay
And it works just like it does in the animal. 
 just 
 Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel. 
okay
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk, just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does. 
 just 
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air. 
 just 
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing? 
you see
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia. 
well
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this. 
you see
You see it there? There? Watch it come down. 
you see
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit? 
you see
It actually uses its tail too, just like we saw in the lab. 
 just 
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it. 
you know
I can just sit back and relax." 
 just 
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic. 
 just 
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was, outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed. 
well
I was faster but just as depressed. 
 just 
And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work, because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called. 
 just 
Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock. 
well
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under. 
 just 
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome," we just keep following these eight principles, because that is not only how we achieve success, it's how we sustain it. 
 just 
So what did I learn? Well, here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza. 
well
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, "Hey, can you deliver the pizza?" 
well
I mean, what is a biosphere? 
i mean
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right? 
i guess
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. 
well
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. 
well
And I don't mean that in an abstract sense; I mean it rather literally. 
i mean
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. 
i mean
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying. 
i mean
And you might think, well, "Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?" 
well
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. 
well
And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. 
 just 
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation -- that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes, but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall. 
 just 
Put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well. 
well
Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well, because the same equipment -- phones, computers -- let you consume and produce. 
well
And it's not just Internet or no Internet. 
 just 
And so they started, the citizen journalists started reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture. 
well
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you, just please stop protesting in public." 
 just 
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages. 
 just 
They also affect people who want to send messages, because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole, not just a particular strategy. 
 just 
And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in. 
i mean
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull. 
 just 
I mean who would put themselves through that? 
i mean
The question had to be asked, "Well, can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions?" 
well
So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image -- as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body. 
you see
And so -- I get to talk about robots -- the da Vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision. 
 just 
And in fact if you, or anyone you know, had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years, chances are it was done with one of these systems. 
you know
But if you need to reach more places than just one, you need to move the robot. 
 just 
And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci. 
 just 
And as you see it come out, in order to actually be able to do anything useful, it can't all stay clustered up like this. 
you see
And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution, we need to not just take our hands in in new ways, we also need to take our eyes in in new ways. 
 just 
I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom, and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top. 
you see
And when you get to that point -- I mean, these maladies don't care how many books you've written, how many companies you've started, that Nobel Prize you have yet to win, how much time you planned to spend with your children. 
i mean
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?" 
okay
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented. 
well
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems: changing the drop-out rates of school kids, combating addictions, enhancing teen health, curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation, reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate, altering appeals to suicidal terrorists, and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes. 
 just 
Well, the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on, on kind of, three principles. 
well
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders, we need Bricklayers Without Borders, to rebuild the skill set. 
 just 
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda, and so what they also do is the total bypass: just fund NGOs. 
 just 
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system. 
 just 
But, if we put money into the core budget, we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent. 
well
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it's not just that the money is wasted -- that's the least of the problems -- it's that the money is captured. 
 just 
But by the end of the 20th century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way. 
 just 
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the Gates or the Soros or the Google. 
well
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money. 
 just 
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer. 
 just 
If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick, stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad. 
you know
Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. 
 just 
 Imagine, if you will, dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip, with 170 pounds of gear, in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek. 
 just 
I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand, and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert, we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to." 
you know
But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there. 
 just 
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days, we would be blogging, telling stories of, you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces, or we will burn. 
you know
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled, that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds, because that's what it felt like. 
well
We were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well, about 10-hour trekking days, 15-hour trekking days, sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal. 
well
We looked at each other with these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed. 
 just 
And I remember looking at the guys thinking, "What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously. 
you know
 I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. 
i mean
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling. 
i mean
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. 
i mean
And sometimes we just start building. 
 just 
From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. 
 just 
And yet, when I look at the environment outside, you see how resistant architecture is to change. 
you see
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas. 
you see
We applaud the well-mannered box. 
well
By the way, it is a story that is told through its hard materials. 
by the way
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee. 
you know
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile, but to reach out across the abyss of history, to places we have never been, and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky. 
 just 
It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms. 
 just 
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation. 
you know
It's not only the forms of cities, but the fact that they incarnate emotions, not just of those who build them, but of those who live there as well. 
well
Inexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything. 
you know
Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story, but the story is very short, which says, "We have no story to tell you." 
you see
So again, the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion, which has reduced architecture into banality. 
 just 
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power. 
 just 
And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture, You know, brain surgery, atomic theory, genetics, economics are complex complex fields. 
you know
So again, the evasion of that sphere, which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture, the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me. 
 just 
It's also, just like life, the asking of questions. 
 just 
You know we can simulate almost anything. 
you know
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves. 
 just 
You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected, will always be unexpected. 
you know
You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future. 
you know
And often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done, what has been done, how the world has remained both in between stability and instability. 
 just 
And yet, I do believe that in every social space, in every public space, there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought, that blunt technique, but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions forward, backward, sideways and around. 
 just 
It can reach into millennia that have been buried, and return them in a just and unexpected equity. 
 just 
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes, it should not play it safe. 
you know
These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us, but are important for everybody in this world. 
 just 
And finally, it's the freedom that America represents, not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you. 
 just 
I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser, not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight. 
 just 
Not just for New York, but for the world. 
 just 
You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family. 
you know
The whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it? 
you know
You know, commonality, the first line in Charles' narration was, "The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States. From the sky, our cities look much the same." 
you know
So that was just a little snip. 
 just 
And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music. 
you know
And Charles just checking it out there. 
 just 
It's just the things you try out to kind of make it work better. 
 just 
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs. 
you know
But you know the object is just a pivot. 
you know
Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that. 
you know
Sun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise? 
well
ED: Okay, good. 
okay
And it's all part of the, you know, they used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously." 
you know
Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing. 
 just 
And I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward, it's not about just doing one thing. 
 just 
And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now. 
 just 
And I suppose some nut has had a gold thali that he's eaten off of. 
i suppose
Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style. 
 just 
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry, just the simplest of shapes. 
 just 
It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image and you go, "Oh! I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing." 
you see
Well, again, the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at. 
well
And, by the way, this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk, in some of our organizations and some of our divisions. 
by the way
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during 1975 and 1979. 
well
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan, including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945. 
i mean
So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank But not just that, they actually banned money. 
 just 
And they're giving about -- in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess -- they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice. 
i guess
And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively, that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know, this was a moment of truth. 
you know
And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom, but also fear, because we had just come out of Cambodia. 
 just 
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well. 
well
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry. 
i mean
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. 
you know
What if I could stick this molecule, slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs? 
 just 
 So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street. 
well
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too. 
i mean
So we did it. Okay? 
okay
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago. 
well
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out. 
well
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first. 
well
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?" 
okay
These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can. 
 just 
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things. 
you see
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened. 
 just 
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids, and the birthrate goes down radically. 
 just 
That's where you see some of the source, not from my fellow environmentalists, but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power. 
you see
Well the good news is that the developing world, but frankly, the whole world, is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors. 
well
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on, might serve even better. 
 just 
By the way, this map from 2006 is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth from Europe, and they're finally getting out from under that. 
by the way
And as those events keep happening we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?" 
okay
And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization. 
 just 
But if we just say "OK, China, you're worried, you go ahead. 
 just 
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were, "We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it." 
well
I have a studio in Berlin -- let me cue on here -- which is down there in this snow, just last weekend. 
 just 
So just keep looking. Don't mind me. 
 just 
But nevertheless, what the potential is -- and just keep looking there -- what the potential is, obviously, is to kind of move the border of who is the author, and who is the receiver. 
 just 
Do you see when I said in the beginning, it's about why, rather than how? 
you see
I would say yes. It is obviously about not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better, or even worse, if you ask me. 
 just 
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities. 
 just 
Because I think it makes a difference whether you have a body rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture. 
 just 
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way. 
 just 
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses, and another doctor across from me. 
well
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle, you know, not too big. 
you know
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years. 
you know
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times, we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. 
 just 
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia, and do this harvest as an outpatient. 
 just 
This device was just FDA approved in the last year. 
 just 
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year, generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner. 
 just 
But then, for some reason, I got into something else, just recently. 
 just 
What I mean by psychopathic killer are these people, these types of people. 
i mean
And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about. 
you know
So we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern. 
 just 
And I'd given this one talk in Israel, just this past year. 
 just 
And so, if you have that gene, and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation, this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster. 
you see
And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area, you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate, I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me. 
you know
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes. 
well
Well she said, "There is good news and bad news. 
well
Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie." 
okay
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide. 
okay
Okay, now this gives one a little pause. 
okay
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species. 
well
What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones. 
 just 
Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being, these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation. 
well
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once, not just twice, but probably three times. 
 just 
Not just in modern humans, but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors, the Neanderthals. 
 just 
And just in the last 5,000 years, in increasing rates, over increasing distances. 
 just 
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people, voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years. 
 just 
Well, often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted. 
well
Because the problem there is just as severe, but it is more sinister, because vitamin D deficiency, from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation, is a major problem. 
 just 
You just have to look at your skin. 
 just 
 Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, "Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?" 
well
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people, children, had the right to education. 
i suppose
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone; it needed the world to work together. 
 just 
 One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. 
well
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth, for jobs, as well as for financial stability, global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared, and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. 
well
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone. 
 just 
For me they normally happen, these career crises, often, actually, on a Sunday evening, just as the sun is starting to set, and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow. 
 just 
You know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times, that we're all greedy people. 
you know
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think, "This is somebody who's greedy." 
you see
You know, in the Middle Ages, in England, when you met a very poor person, that person would be described as an "unfortunate" -- literally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate. 
you know
That's exhilarating if you're doing well, and very crushing if you're not. It leads, in the worst cases -- in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim -- it leads to increased rates of suicide. 
well
I just want to turn to a few of them. 
 just 
When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure, one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income, a loss of status. 
 just 
And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art. 
i suppose
Now I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible. 
 just 
CA: I mean, do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy? 
i mean
And when I say desktop, I don't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk. 
 just 
By saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me." 
 oh 
And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they're just going about their everyday business. 
 just 
So 70 years on, there's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which, you know, L, M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this, and P, T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this. 
you know
And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech. 
you see
So these are our live subtitles, that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of "The Ursonate" -- fortunately Jaap does too, very well -- and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is. 
well
Okay. So ... 
okay
You know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all. 
you know
So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo. 
 just 
Okay. Ah, there is lots of nice bright video. 
okay
There is just a little test screen that shows that it's working. 
 just 
And what I'm just going to do is -- I'm going to hide that. 
 just 
Hello? And I can ... hello ... okay. 
okay
You know, you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way. 
you know
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at, as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them. 
you see
So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink. 
 just 
And you can see, just once again, how it's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking. 
 just 
And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it, which is just a minute long. Okay. 
 just 
Just one eye, looking at you, and eliminating everything else about a face, but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of, as an element. 
 just 
Okay. So the last project I'm going to show is this new one called Snout. 
okay
Well, this is 2009. 
well
I mean --  if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe there's a reason for that. 
i mean
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen. 
i mean
Well, we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962. 
well
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes. 
well
And we just record what we see." 
 just 
Well I don't think that. 
well
I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind, the things that made us different from everybody else, and all our relatives. 
 just 
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps, could that be why we are naked? 
well
I mean, look at the elephant. 
i mean
So back in 1982 I said, "Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor." 
well
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin. 
well
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?" 
well
They say "Well ... 
well
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting." 
well
But you know, that makes me feel good, because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood. 
you know
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt. 
 just 
The president has seen how those rules worked well. 
well
So that if we want to create environments with good rules, we can't just tear down. 
 just 
We've got to find ways to build up, as well. 
well
Now, when I say that, some of you are starting to think, "Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?" 
well
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa. 
well
Now, if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites, but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them? 
 just 
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night, the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks like most of the world is already built out. 
well
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild.  But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like, suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro. 
 just 
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant, and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture. 
well
The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas. 
well
We all seem to think that, you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there. 
you know
So you'd just see her feet. 
 just 
And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow." 
 just 
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished. 
well
So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge. 
 just 
And I says, "Well, try me." 
well
I think he was just warning him actually. 
 just 
WW: So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very, very slowly, manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different. 
 just 
And, you know, all different things happen. 
you know
That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture. 
 just 
When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers. 
you see
Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this, because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of, you know, the beginning of people coming to America. 
well
 It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape. 
 just 
But they just don't seem to get through. 
 just 
It's because, using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving. 
 just 
So we just switch off: us, governments and aid agencies. 
 just 
Well, today, I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved. 
well
By the way, since I've been speaking, another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea. 
by the way
And four children have just died. 
 just 
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do." 
okay
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome? 
you know
Okay, now for the science bit. 
okay
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration. 
okay
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should. 
i guess
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here. And this is the water. 
well
But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this. 
you know
Okay.  Right. 
okay
We're just going to pour that in there. 
 just 
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm. 
okay
So I'm just going to put that in there. 
 just 
So we're just going to put that in there as well. 
well
 Okay.  Now. 
okay
You just scoop the water up. 
 just 
Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. 
 just 
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit. 
 just 
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet? 
okay
 Okay. There we go. 
okay
Give it a few pumps. Okay? 
okay
I've got to be quick. Okay, ready? 
okay
Michael Pritchard: Okay. 
okay
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay? 
okay
 Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. 
okay
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating. 
 just 
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle. 
well
So with just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target without access to safe drinking water. 
 just 
If I could reveal anything that is hidden from us, at least in modern cultures, it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten, that we used to know as well as we knew our own names. 
well
That's where I live, and it's my university as well. 
well
And I told him, "You know, Cody, the wasps actually made that." 
you know
And I could see why he thought, you know -- it was so beautifully done. 
you know
But it occurred to me, how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done, that we must have done it. 
well
Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see, in what's called their bionic car. 
you see
We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. 
you see
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires with PVC for insulation. 
you know
MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips. 
 just 
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal. 
 just 
Well I was born in the most difficult time, when my country was at war. 
well
So I'm just going to go into a different step now, which is easier for me. 
 just 
So one thing I know about music: music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system, your mind, your heart, influence your soul and your spirit, and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing. 
you know
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it. 
you know
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old families in a refugee camps. 
you see
So these people, you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid. 
 just 
Well now, my time is going, so I want to sing a song. 
well
I'm gonna sing this song, just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference. 
 just 
♫ What would I be? Me! ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! ♫ ♫ Yeah! Yeah! ♫ ♫ You would have seen my face on the telly ♫ ♫ Fat hungry belly ♫ ♫ Flies in my eyes, head too big for my size ♫ ♫ Just another little starving child ♫ ♫ Running around in Africa, born to be wild ♫ ♫ Praise God, praise the Almighty ♫ 
 just 
♫ I would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ Just another refugee ♫ ♫ I stand here because somebody cared ♫ ♫ I stand here because somebody dared ♫ ♫ I know there is a lot of Emmas out there ♫ ♫ Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child ♫ ♫ What would I be?

 just 
When I got to law school, I didn't do very well. 
well
To put it mildly, I didn't do very well. 
well
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks. 
you see
I mean, I'm an American. I believe in free markets. 
i mean
You've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity, and it does just the opposite. 
 just 
 If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks, where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to. 
well
So, for tasks like this, a narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there, zoom straight ahead to it, they work really well. 
well
If you do really well you get the large reward, on down. 
well
Okay? 
okay
Do you know who sponsored this research? 
you know
You don't see a lot of it, but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on, what it means is paying people adequately and fairly, absolutely -- getting the issue of money off the table, and then giving people lots of autonomy. 
you see
It's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20% time -- done, famously, at Google -- where engineers can spend 20% of their time working on anything they want. 
well
And at Google, as many of you know, about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20% time: things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News. 
you know
They just have to get their work done. 
 just 
Well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time. 
well
I mean, think about how much we love this. 
i mean
If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world, putting up wires to get power from where it's created to where it's used. 
 just 
So, before I got here, I thought, "You know, I am from North America. 
you know
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency -- by the way, that's still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing. 
by the way
And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls, why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?" 
 just 
And if you can cause that coil to resonate, what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies -- at a fairly high frequency, by the way. 
by the way
I mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe. 
i mean
You know. What about safety? 
you know
By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is. 
by the way
The 10 seconds actually are because we -- I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord. 
 just 
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay. 
okay
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake. 
 just 
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out. 
you know
And if I can get the camera -- okay, great -- you'll see, as I get sort of close... 
okay
So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones. 
you know
 And Nokia as well. 
well
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that, and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well. 
well
But then you know, I press them like this. 
you know
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know, you can live long. 
you know
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family, and a life with 60 to 70 years. 
you see
This great nation, Mexico, has the problem that arms are coming from North, across the borders, so they had to stop that, because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know. 
you know
By the way, I'm teaching you how to use our website, Gapminder World, while I'm correcting this, because this is a free utility on the net. 
by the way
So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know? 
you know
Because what you see here, what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman, isn't it. 
you see
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution. 
well
Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia? 
you see
And I come now, into projections, but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --  that's where the projections are not valid any longer. 
you know
Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes, they have been saving, you know, over the last decade. 
you know
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different. 
you see
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do. 
 just 
Well, MDG 4. 
well
They started very well. They used the aid well. 
well
Well the Swedish students protest at this point. 
well
Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born. 
okay
These yellow are just about to be doing this. 
 just 
You see the tragedy in South Africa there. 
you see
And this is the situation you see. 
you see
So to just end up, there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest, which we don't know. 
 just 
And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world. 
 just 
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play. 
 just 
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more. 
 just 
You see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it. 
you see
And I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors, and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them. 
you know
but, to be honest, the description goes on and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however." 
to be honest
 And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here, and the lesson is: so why save it? 
i guess
I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one? 
 just 
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait. 
 just 
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings, financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures, and all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens, it means extinction. We lose diversity. 
 just 
So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity. 
you know
What you see is an artist's conception of this facility, which is built in a mountain in Svalbard. 
you see
This is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality. 
 just 
It's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional. 
you know
This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States, of Canada, and an international institution from Syria. 
you see
There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it. 
 just 
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people. 
well
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. 
 just 
There are just way too few eye care professionals. 
 just 
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket. 
 just 
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there. 
okay
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ... 
okay
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... 
okay
... I've just ... 
 just 
If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you. 
 just 
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from. 
 just 
And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? 
 just 
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs, they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks, and it's founded above all on care, on relationships, on what people do to other people, often one to one, rather than simply selling them a product. 
 just 
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students, the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people, as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. 
well
He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act, you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. 
you see
Now, the idea that all of this represents, I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis, recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress. 
well
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country, as well as a public service innovation lab. 
well
And just a few months ago, President Obama launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House. 
 just 
And what people are beginning to ask is: Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent, of our GDP, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled? 
 just 
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade, but only with radical and systematic experiment, not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too. 
 just 
It will become more involved in social investment, and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others, not just from what you sell to them, and from relationships as well as from consumption. 
well
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France. 
 just 
Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy, which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment, just as capitalism has seen off socialism. 
well
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when, just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too, the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end, and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society, transformed from being a master into a servant, a servant to the productive economy and of human needs. 
 just 
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate. 
 just 
It's not just competitive, it's also caring. 
 just 
But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago, and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for, or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway. 
 just 
He created an experiment using a metal plate, covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. 
you see
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. 
well
Well, there is still a lot to explore in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field. 
well
I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts I often design them. 
well
It's critical now that when a car crash happens it isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew. 
 just 
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated. 
you see
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had. 
well
You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car. 
 just 
"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames, and how about someone, you know, big explosion." 
well
Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor." 
 just 
Well, you'd die if you did that. 
well
That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right. 
 just 
And I'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then. 
 just 
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind. 
 just 
They're just so, so delicate. 
 just 
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down. 
 just 
You can just see them there, popping open. 
 just 
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon, the little black dots are people. 
 just 
Now you may think this is just a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride, just the world's biggest stunt. 
 just 
Well there's a little bit more to it than that. 
well
You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen. 
you know
And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down, in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay. 
okay
Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa? 
 just 
 Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me. 
 just 
Well, within about three weeks, I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras into 25 time-lapse cameras. 
well
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet. 
 just 
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland, and we have repeat photography positions, that is places we just visit on an annual basis, in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia. 
 just 
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened. 
 just 
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community. 
you know
Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community, and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED, and like our relationship with the Obama White House, with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well. 
well
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion. 
 just 
You see the glacier flowing in from the right, dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour. 
you see
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks, and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile, but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. 
 just 
Particularly in the world of sea ice, the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago, and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with. 
 just 
And you see where it ended in these various spring days, June, May, then October. 
you see
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time? 
well
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick, just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle. 
 just 
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago, as you can see. June 25th, monster calving events happened. 
 just 
Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier, and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film. 
okay
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it. 
okay
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world, and show me just how fragile the world is. 
 just 
And so ever since I think I was just six years old, I dreamed of going to the polar regions. 
 just 
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true. 
well
But I have seen that place change beyond all description, just in that short period of time. 
 just 
Well, swimming across the North Pole, it's not an ordinary thing to do. 
well
I mean, just to put it in perspective, 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool. 
 just 
The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade. 
 just 
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport, you just dive into the sea and off you go. 
 just 
And on day four, we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim. 
 just 
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before, because it's just impossible to train in those types of conditions. 
 just 
I remember just trying to get out of the water. 
 just 
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window. 
 just 
And after just three minutes in that water, he was able to get himself out. 
 just 
And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that, because he knew me so well. 
well
And we stopped the ship, and it was just as the scientists had predicted. 
 just 
Narrator : We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally. 
 just 
Everything just looks so gray around here, and looks so cold. 
 just 
We've just seen our first polar bears. 
 just 
Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis! 
well
 LP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this: It took me four months again to feel my hands. 
 just 
The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. 
 just 
I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change, and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn't even exist. 
 just 
That is, maybe you have a mind, and everyone else is just a really convincing robot. 
 just 
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, "I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant." 
i mean
And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts. 
 just 
And you know what pirates really like? 
you know
And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch." 
you know
Child: Um, yeah. 
 um
So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts -- in children it's much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you. 
 just 
Okay. Good.  So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm? 
okay
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse. 
 just 
Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain. 
okay
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. 
okay
And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar, but it was really poison and so she caused a death, people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame. 
okay
So what I've told you today is that people come, actually, especially well equipped to think about other people's thoughts. 
well
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call. 
i mean
I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being, but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not-torture chamber, do acts that people here might be worried about. 
i mean
I mean, what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career, someone, you or someone else, is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem? 
i mean
Well, of course, there is globalization, technology, communications, all that stuff, which we'll talk about a little bit later. 
well
Now in Bulgaria -- this photograph was taken in Bulgaria -- when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe, it wasn't just communism; it was the state that collapsed as well. 
well
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies. 
well
Why? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing, but also, as they say in the retail trade, it's location, location, location. 
well
Now Italian police, when this trade started, had just two boats which could go at the same speed. 
 just 
Well, this is where we come to globalization, because that was not just the deregulation of global trade. 
well
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them. 
well
Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it, of course, down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud, as it's called, in part because it's marketed as organic, which of course goes down very well in California. 
well
The public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result, the architectural object. 
 just 
The design process was really tough, almost like a struggle for survival, but gradually an idea evolved: this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city, sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome, but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside, with the library. 
well
You know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers. 
you know
You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest. 
you know
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it. 
 just 
You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city in central Asia, because that's not really how you get commissions. 
 just 
And what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation. 
 just 
 Yes, maybe just to round off. 
 just 
And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay? 
okay
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome. 
 just 
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that? 
you know
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures. 
you know
Okay. Atoms, you can't see them. 
okay
 But well done, him. 
well
And somebody said to him, "Well what's the point of these, Heinrich? 
well
And he said, "Well, I've no idea. 
well
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday." 
i guess
We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well. 
well
But there are also hallucinations as well, and hallucinations are completely different. 
well
Well, I examined her carefully. 
well
Well, so I did tell the nurses. 
well
The things you see can be very complicated indeed. 
you see
She had very mobile hallucinations as well. 
well
You know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants. 
you know
Well, what is going on with these people? 
well
In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things, you're going mad, but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different. 
you see
So, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car. 
you see
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted. 
well
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common. 
 just 
 Well, yeah, a lot of them. 
well
OS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus, which I ignore. 
well

They had a "Let's build a global network" club, and it worked out very well. 
well
Well, to move data around from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier. 
well
It's just part of your neighborly duty. 
 just 
And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it, you have a general sense of where everything is. 
you know
In rare but striking instances, a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble. 
 just 
Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way. 
well
It advertised -- the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet, to declare what you see near you -- it advertised that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube. 
you see
You see, that announcement went one click out, which got reverberated, one click out. 
you see
Now just think about that. 
 just 
Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG. 
well
This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness of YouTube engineers. I promise. 
 just 
 But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work. 
 just 
And you just bring your problems to the page. 
 just 
They even gather together in such groups as the Counter-Vandalism Unit -- "Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" -- to just clean up the pages. 
 just 
Here is just a snapshot of some of them. 
 just 
Now, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia. 
 just 
I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover. 
i mean
 You're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass behind her." 
you know
It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site, not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment, but just said, "Hey, would you mind?" 
 just 
I believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do, to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact, and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it. 
 just 
We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors -- everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online -- to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says, "You know, I'd rather not." 
you know
And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on," but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online. 
 just 
An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them, and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination. 
 just 
 So, my urging, my thought, is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information. 
 just 
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, which, as some of you may know, is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy. 
well
And I think by 2009, this news has finally reached Britain, so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well. 
well
 But, you know, even beyond that, if you think about the logic underlying it, is something I call iPod liberalism, where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese who happens to have and love his iPod will also love liberal democracy. 
you know
But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping iPods not bombs -- I mean, it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman's new book. 
i mean
Well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places. 
well
And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek, which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang, with other inmates and hit his head against the wall, which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers. 
well
I'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators. 
 just 
Because they say, "Well look, we asked you, we consulted you, you voted on it. 
well
Well, great. You are the one who is to blame." 
well
Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say, "Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum." 
well
I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know that there was no planning in Russia for the next month. 
i mean
I mean KGB, and not just KGB, used to torture in order to actually get this data. 
 just 
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran, there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft. 
well
Well I say we have to stop thinking about the number of iPods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals, dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society. 
well
Before I discovered the wonders of science, I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers. 
 just 
I couldn't read English that well. 
well
Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic. 
okay
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to." 
 just 
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders. 
 just 
In this context I'll just show you a few. 
 just 
But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts. 
 just 
And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. 
 just 
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. 
 just 
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. 
 just 
 But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text. 
 just 
I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction. 
 just 
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth. 
i mean
And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. 
 just 
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions. 
 just 
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India. 
 just 
And I would submit that it's time to consider that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. 
well
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing. 
well
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. 
well
In TEDistan, there are no borders, just connected spaces and unconnected spaces. 
 just 
Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved: our basic political geography. 
well
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world. 
 just 
And as you know, China is the most populous. 
you know
Well, just on the other side of the Amo River, in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China, you have over 100 million people. 
well
Again, like Mongolia, China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it. 
 just 
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. 
 just 
Well it's China's turn again. 
well
For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to China as well. 
well
And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world. 
 just 
There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries, such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States, most countries vow to just sit it out, including American allies like Korea and Australia. 
 just 
Well, if you remember before World War II, Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere. 
well
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now. 
well
Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. 
 just 
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe, and even a potentially Turkmen- Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well. 
well
The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries, and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way. 
 just 
In fact most of that happened on just one day. 
 just 
Well in light blue, you see the zones or the regions that are at least two-thirds or more dependent on the European Union for trade and investment. 
well
Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia is a very good place to start. 
well
Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south, Balochistan. Two weeks ago, Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison, and this was the flag that they raised over it. 
 just 
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa. 
 just 
By focusing on a design, maybe just a single product, I was being incremental and not having much of an impact. 
 just 
But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. 
 just 
And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. 
 just 
So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942, created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being. 
well
And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. 
 just 
So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. 
 just 
Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. 
 just 
And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa. 
 just 
And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems, we can have a bigger impact. 
 just 
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works. 
 just 
People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, "all day and every day," not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself. 
 just 
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time, that this was so central to the religious life. 
you know
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. 
 just 
And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. 
 just 
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. 
 just 
And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling. 
 just 
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis. 
 just 
And she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject. 
 just 
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star, which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. 
well
So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star. 
 just 
 It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. 
 just 
I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. 
you know
But you know, everything is relative. 
you know
Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny, weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. 
 just 
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. 
you see
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. 
you see
And sometimes they just capture stars. 
 just 
So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon, five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. 
 just 
And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium. 
well
If you receive something interesting, well that's what SETI does actually, what SETI has been doing for many years. 
well
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say, "Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow." 
well
If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star, if you see strange chemical elements, it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. 
you see
And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know, and for even more that you've never heard of. 
you know
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life that I actually love, I adapt to it. 
 just 
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. 
you see
But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large, rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two. 
 just 
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. 
well
As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message  on the back of the shirt. 
 just 
 Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio. 
 just 
And then just leave it all to them. 
 just 
And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals. 
well
Scotch tape came out of this program, as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M. 
well
I just, without a plan, I just reacted to little requests, not work requests, those I all said no to, but other little requests. 
 just 
And that actually, specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me. 
well
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services. 
well
I'll just show two now. 
 just 
And you see the self confidence almost comes back, but not quite. 
you see
 I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here. 
you see
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. 
 just 
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture. 
 just 
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent. 
well
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. 
 just 
 In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary. 
 just 
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing. 
well
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process. 
 just 
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. 
 just 
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. 
okay
We just read the back of a label on a packet. 
 just 
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use. 
well
Well I think it looks a bit like this. 
well
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. 
 just 
By the way, these can be men as well. 
well
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole. 
 just 
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. 
 just 
Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation? 
okay
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date? 
you know
But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen. 
 just 
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. 
 just 
Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes. It's just what we do. 
 just 
You don't want this. Okay? 
okay
So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance," my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave. 
 just 
No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, "How can people be so dumb, and yet live?" 
 just 
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does." 
i mean
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?" 
you see
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, "Well while you were, you know, doing your research," -- notice the condescending tone -- "While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution." 
well
And the third one got the same wry smile and said, "Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine." 
well
And my question on the other side is just going to be, "What do you think they value?" 
 just 
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. 
okay
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One. 
okay
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way? 
you know
I really don't want to just say "I'm great," because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends. 
 just 
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this. 
well
Sorry.  Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi? 
well
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right? 
 just 
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay? 
okay
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club. 
you know
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. 
i mean
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them. 
 just 
They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves. 
 just 
You know they do polls, right? 
you know
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that. 
okay
"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?" 
 just 
And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say, "Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing." 
you know
She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language. 
well
Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity. 
well
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. 
 just 
Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person. 
 just 
I told him that I had just read a novel called "American Psycho" --  -- and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers. 
 just 
 But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans. 
 just 
But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them. 
 just 
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions? 
 just 
My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories. 
 just 
I want to start with a game. Okay? 
okay
Really? Okay. 
okay
And instead of telling you, I'll just show you. 
 just 
What you see here is a jungle scene, and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect. 
you see
And now you see it. 
you see
But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible. 
 just 
Let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay? 
i mean
So, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see. 
well
That's what it's learning. Okay? 
okay
Okay? So, what does this mean for context? 
okay
So I'll show you what I mean. 
i mean
Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics. 
 just 
So you see it that way. 
you see
So you see it that way. 
you see
Here you see four gray tiles on your left, seven gray tiles on the right. 
you see
They are the same. Okay? 
okay
How do you know? 
you know
You see how she has a little number on her? 
you see
Okay, this is complete rubbish. 
okay
Well, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound, and we enable people to hear their visual world. 
well
And then we just simply translate that into sound. 
 just 
So, working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. 
you see
So, a six-year-old child. Okay? 
okay
What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay? 
okay
Okay. So they are physically the same. 
okay
Now remember -- you know that the middle nine are exactly the same. 
you know
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding. 
 just 
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. 
 just 
And it's this map you see here. 
you see
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared. 
 just 
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat." 
you know
So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is, "A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water." That's the best thing for a beaver. 
you know
So we just started making a list. 
 just 
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work. 
 just 
The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity. 
you see
Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains? 
well
And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. 
i mean
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy. 
 just 
Okay. So I'm smiling. 
okay
Okay, here we go. 
okay
Okay, so you smile, frowning. 
okay
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you. 
 just 
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ... 
 just 
They work extraordinarily well. 
well
And he planted it in a royal potato patch, with guards who had instructions to guard over it, night and day, but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. 
well
Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil. 
 just 
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys: All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. 
by the way
 But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic. 
 just 
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay? 
okay
Obviously, I don't want people to do this, because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. 
 just 
 So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that, when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there. 
you see
Man #2: [unclear] You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking. 
you see
Man: Just try both of them. 
 just 
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that. 
by the way
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. 
you see
We're just packing in columns, so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions. 
 just 
But it's not just a symphony of perception. 
 just 
You may be born lucky, where you know how to master your neocortical column, and you can play a fantastic symphony. 
you know
So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column -- and it's not just for neuroscience; it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. 
 just 
But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication, the rules of connectivity, because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron. 
 just 
But as you do this, what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations, and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse. 
you see
Well, we don't have to speculate. 
well
And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron. 
 just 
So, the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses, and look just at the raw electrical activity. 
 just 
So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space. 
 just 
Well, this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious. 
well
First is physiological.  Sorry about that. I've just given you a shot of cortisol, your fight/flight hormone. 
 just 
It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. 
 just 
They are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster, or just turning around on the door. 
 just 
I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we've developed, which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about. 
 just 
Let me just talk about brands for a moment, because some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. 
 just 
Don't just bombard them with stuff. 
 just 
And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America. 
well
Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage, in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward. 
 just 
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay? 
okay
Do you know what this was right here? 
you know
This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high? 
you know
And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government. 
well
I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks. Okay? 
okay
 Dentists report molars, you know, people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress. 
you know
And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. 
 just 
And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right? 
i mean
By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but be about better. 
 just 
We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice. 
 just 
They've just instituted dynamic pricing. 
 just 
We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City, you know, in January, and suddenly Sully has become a key name on Babycenter. 
you know
Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card? 
you know
So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. 
you see
Have a stick? Well why not have a carrot? 
well
First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating healthcare. 
 just 
Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. Right? 
well
And it's also become a very, very valuable sort of advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well. 
well
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it. 
you see
And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights -- just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road, polarizers can block the shine off of the skin, so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. 
 just 
Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit, we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in, and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. 
 just 
If you take the difference between these two images here, you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin. 
 just 
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here. 
 just 
And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry, they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called "displacement maps" that animate as well. 
well
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff. 
you know
You know, this little office of the conductor. 
you know
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. 
i mean
You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music. 
you know
You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor. 
you know
You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event. 
you know
And not all conductors do just that. 
 just 
Okay? Ready? 
okay
And you know what happened to Muti? 
you know
Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign." 
i mean
Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control? 
well
 What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed. 
you see
Did you see the hands? 
you see
Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice. 
you see
Once like a Muti, and you'll --  -- clap, just once. 
 just 
And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay? 
okay
 Okay? Ready? Let's do it. 
okay
 Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything. 
you know
Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way? 
well
You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you. 
you know
But here and there and that. You know what to do. 
you know
 Again you see the beautiful body language. 
you see
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important. 
you know
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here?  You know what happens? Gravitation is no more. 
you know
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one. 
well
 Did you see Lenny's face? 
you see
You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain. 
you know
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera, I was going to show you my invention, which I came up with. 
 just 
Miniaturization as well. 
well
In every aspect of their lives, they wished for progress, just as we do. 
 just 
Well, we've seen that that can't be true. 
well
By the way, why don't we do that? 
by the way
 Empiricism is inadequate because, well, scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. 
well
Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction. 
well
You know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved? 
you know
Our connection to reality is never just perception. 
 just 
I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation. 
 just 
What does that mean? Well, explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen, that accounts for what's seen. 
well
Because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities. 
well
One is well known: untestable theories. 
well
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow. 
well
So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material. 
 just 
They think big. Okay? 
okay
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles. 
you know
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. 
 just 
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species. 
 just 
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them. 
 just 
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries. 
 just 
I just wasn't drunk or high. 
 just 
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time. 
well
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well. 
well
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. 
 just 
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs. 
 just 
And the gateway you see behind has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them. 
you see
You see it already. Immediately you go in, the reflective symmetry in the water. 
you see
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started. 
well
But what I could do is just leave it where it is, pick it up, and put it down again. 
 just 
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise. 
well
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is. 
 just 
Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on, and count how many symmetries there are. 
okay
What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries, but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object. 
 just 
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn, followed by a third of a turn, the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. 
well
Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board at the side here, great, excellent. 
well
Okay, I'm going to sort you out. 
okay
Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are in that number. Okay? 
okay
Okay, now if you want to play, I want you to stand up, okay? 
okay
Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six. 
okay
 Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay? 
okay
The people who just last sat down. 
 just 
Okay, how many digits do you have in your number? 
okay
 21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours? 
okay
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. 
 just 
I know some people who say "Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything, I'm not going to even begin to try." 
well
And then God looked to the future and realized, if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist. 
 just 
And then God looked to the future and realized that, in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion, there would be anarchy and chaos. 
 just 
So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. 
 just 
You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. 
you know
But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important. 
well
And he said, you know, "This is what's happening." 
you know
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream. 
 just 
When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes. 
you see
If you know how to pray, pray. 
you know
Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, 
 just 
This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs. 
 just 
And mom overheard us and said, "Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. 
well
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. 
 just 
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'" And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn 
well
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. 
i mean
The song says, ♫ "I made heaven so happy today, ♫ ♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ 
you see
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. 
well
That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? 
well
The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend, and he knocks on the door, and a voice answers, "Who's there?" 
well
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. 
i mean
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement, just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action. 
 just 
He said, "Well what are you doing?" 
well
So he said, "Okay, I get the point." 
okay
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he's looking just terrible. 
 just 
Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it." 
well
"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be? 
well
He was just immediately caught with the situation. 
 just 
So he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh. 
well
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you." 
 just 
And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love. 
well
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me. 
you know
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. 
 just 
So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love -- just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know. 
 just 
People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom, when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. 
you know
And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you, and you see how they could be familiar to you. 
you see
And so you see beings in their potential happiness. 
you see
And you look at them, and you see how they are. 
you see
And I'm sure he did that later.  But that just indicates the state of mind, you know. 
you know
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing, by dying, but they don't. 
 just 
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know. 
you know
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. 
 just 
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate," and sort of think you're stuck there. 
well
But I'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature, you realize that just affirming compassion, and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough. 
 just 
In the beginning, there was compassion, and I mean not just when human beings first showed up, but actually even before that. 
 just 
Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. 
 just 
That's just human nature. 
 just 
So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well, you treat other people well. 
well
And it's good to treat other people well. 
well
I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison, but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right? 
i mean
We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison. 
 just 
Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival -- if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family -- I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you. 
 just 
We all do that, and you see it all over the world. 
you see
You see it in the Middle East: people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel. 
you see
They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say, "Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things that put them in a special category." 
well
The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them, but they impose one on Gaza, and they say, "Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves." 
well
Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay. 
okay
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. 
 just 
It's just a quick introduction to game theory. 
 just 
This won't hurt. Okay. 
okay
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier, about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed, by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies. 
well
Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. 
okay
You can go back all the way to the stone age: technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing, a lot of transportation and communication technologies -- has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non-zero-sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. 
 just 
You've probably heard the term "interdependence" applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum. 
well
And you see this all the time in the modern world. 
you see
And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence that this non-zero-sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass. 
you know
Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected, you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum, mutually profitable relationship with people. 
you know
Once we define somebody as an enemy, we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally. 
 just 
So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American: somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV. 
you see
Well, the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. 
well
And if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America. 
well
You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human. 
you know
I think it's worth the trouble because, again, it just helps us to understand. 
 just 
I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. 
i mean
I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective, as far as compassion and the golden rule go, by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature. 
 just 
And what do I mean by that? 
i mean
I mean that what people are doing is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. 
i mean
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people. 
 just 
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day. 
 just 
A young factory worker who works night shifts, who manages to sneak away from the factory floor, where there is CCTV by the way, and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. 
 just 
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them. 
i mean
Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years, if you just think back 15 years, when you clocked in, when you clocked in to an office, when you clocked in to a factory, there was no contact for the whole duration of the time, there was no contact with your private sphere. 
 just 
If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children, to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. 
 just 
And then the school enacts perfectly well. 
well
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. 
well
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations? 
you know
I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. 
you see
But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff. 
 just 
And another idea that I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material? 
well
Well, you probably recognize the first person. 
well
People become so engaged that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate. 
 just 
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience. 
 just 
But actually, just the opposite is happening. 
 just 
And the final, sort of, formulation of this "American Idol" format, which has just appeared in Afghanistan, is a new program called "The Candidate." 
 just 
So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000. 
 just 
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper. 
 just 
And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. 
you see
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. 
 just 
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket, you can just do the gesture of taking a photo, and it takes a photo for you. 
 just 
Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. 
 just 
 And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT -- Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk, outside, on just a newspaper. 
 just 
 When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon. 
 just 
So, rather than waiting for that, I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper. 
 just 
I removed the microphone from that, and then just pinched that -- like I just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around. 
 just 
When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer. 
 just 
 And why only computers? We can just play with papers. 
 just 
And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness: this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that. 
you see
So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment. 
 just 
There is my world and there is your world, and my world is always better than your world, because my world, you see, is rational and yours is superstition. 
you see
Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon. 
 just 
Because, you see, the Greeks believed you live only once, and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx. 
you see
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram and Krishna, Govinda Hari. 
you see
You see, the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. 
you see
Because, you see, nothing lasts forever in India, not even death. 
you see
What goes around always comes around, and this rule applies not just to man, but also the gods. 
 just 
You see, the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram, as Krishna. 
you see
You see, what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves? 
you see
You see, businesses are not run as institutions, by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. 
you see
You see, Indian music, for example, does not have the concept of harmony. 
you see
It's not about compliance. It's about setting, getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules -- just look at your Indian people around here, you'll see them smile; they know what it is. 
 just 
 You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. 
you see
And people are okay with it. 
okay
And mythology does not pay, well, until now. 
well
But nobody was interested in listening to it, you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. 
you see
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar. 
you see
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. 
you see
So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God. 
you see
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy. 
you see
 "Why did I do the setting, why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please." 
 just 
And invariably, you see a tear, because the penny has dropped. 
you see
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions. 
you see
 You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something. 
you know
Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year. 
well
Well, somebody had a great idea. 
well
Man: You know how expensive those are. 
you know
Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait. 
 just 
Well, here is one such way. 
well
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide. 
well
Some whistled well. 
well
And I just don't think that's what India's all about, or should be all about. 
 just 
Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army. 
well
Is it the economy? Well, we have now the fifth-largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. 
well
And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States, but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power, the British Council. 
you know
You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rarity. 
you know
But sometimes it just sat there. 
 just 
Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see: the 15 million cell phones a month. 
you see
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi, on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century, wielding a coal-fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century. 
you know
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad." 
you know
 I usually tend to think that the book is usually better, but, having said that, the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe, not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K., but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians. 
 just 
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar, just to watch a Bollywood movie. 
 just 
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years? 
you know
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s, and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. 
i mean
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S. 
i mean
You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections, the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. 
you know
So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon -- and he is male, but he isn't white. 
 oh 
 But, the issue is that when I talked about that example, it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda. 
 just 
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one. 
well
And you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state, and prevent us from being quiet and focused. 
you know
I just wanted to, using the complexity and the technology of the brain, of the human brain. 
 just 
But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain. 
 just 
I want, by this design feel, when you see it, you see, instinctively, this object seems to be very sensitive, very reactive. 
you see
I'm just a designer. So I need them. 
 just 
I just do that to make money. 
 just 
 In this guise of living object approach, I like the idea of a kind of invisible design, as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves. 
 just 
And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go." 
okay
When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room, John was just beside me, and was like, "Hmm. Hmm." 
 just 
I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences. 
i guess
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience, able to be modified by its surroundings, and able to modify it as well. 
well
And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died. 
 just 
And it includes some fishes as well. 
well
Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm with daylight. 
well
 Just for my workshop. 
 just 
This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge, all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life, and not just about his people, but about everything that his people's survival depended on: the trees, the birds, the water, the soil, the forest. 
 just 
It's a future we don't know the details of, but it's a future that has signs, just like Benki saw the signs around him. 
 just 
But you know all that. 
you know
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles. 
you know
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done, because we'll get the results we've always gotten. 
 just 
But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV/AIDS in 1993 -- in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why, and everyone was actually very, very afraid. 
 just 
They have respite homes, the first, the first care centers, the first counseling services -- and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore, but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. 
 just 
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages, and she had a real breakthrough. 
 just 
She would look at you and very quietly, very softly say, "It just happened. 
 just 
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China. 
 just 
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about. 
 just 
It just happens. 
 just 
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we? 
 just 
And we know, just like they knew, how hard it is. 
 just 
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. 
well
Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. 
 just 
And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay? 
okay
Well, let me first back up for a moment. 
well
This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that? 
you see
This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices, measuring tools and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay? 
okay
You know, I've always wanted one of these. 
you know
But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church. 
you know
They are just incredibly expensive. 
 just 
Okay, so when that happens everything lines up. 
okay
I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay? 
okay
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. 
 just 
So, that's just one use. Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses. 
 just 
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. 
 just 
How cool is that? This is just amazing. 
 just 
Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago. 
well
It's just an incredible device. 
 just 
So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. 
 just 
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. 
well
 You see, I was a study nerd. 
you see
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know? 
you know
 And we will see, you know. 
you know
Can you see how it starts to move there? 
you see
And you can see the two cats being here, China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know. 
you know
You see this enormous inequity in China, in the midst of fast economic growth. 
you see
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward, you see that in between them and ahead of them, is the whole emerging economies of the world, which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world." 
you see
You see, China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here. 
you see
Can you see the bubble? 
you see
You see it came down there. 
you see
And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know. 
you know
They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know. 
you know
You see, Japan did it like that. 
you see
Can you see here what Japan did? 
you see
So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure, and electricity is really what is needed in India and China. You know the climate. We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing, and actions has to be taken, otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change. 
you know
And that vision that I got as a young student, 1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes, is just about to happen. 
 just 
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. 
 just 
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage, we move from a time where our economic success, our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume, to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability. 
well
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change. 
 just 
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. 
 just 
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual, that the future will be like the present, just more of it. 
 just 
There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. 
 just 
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are. 
 just 
This is at a time when the city of Bristol, which is quite close to here, was surrounded by commercial market gardens, which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well. 
well
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground? 
you know
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own. 
well
From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world. 
 just 
And we see it all over the place as well now. 
well
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. 
 just 
If you happen to live close to the desert border, you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away, and abandon your home and your life as you know it. 
you know
Well, I'll quickly show you two options. 
well
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni, which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it. 
well
I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain. 
i mean
GB: Well, of course national identity remains important. 
well
CA: Well, indeed. 
well
GB: Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests, what is necessary for America's long-term interests, is proper engagement with the rest of the world, and taking the action that is necessary. 
well
1958, Ghana becomes independent, so it is just over 50 years ago. 
 just 
Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes, as well as the potential for climate change? 
well
I just think we're not seeing, at the moment, the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems. 
 just 
And yet, when the situation changes, you suddenly hear politicians talking as if, you know, for example, the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. 
you know
GB: I think every religion, every faith, and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion -- it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. 
 just 
I mean look, 1918, the Treaty of Versailles, and all the treaties before that, the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else, were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want. 
i mean
if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so. 
well
If you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed, A, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts, B, that there was short-range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract; it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now, and if you could then find a financing mechanism by our inability to deal with climate change over many, many years and decades 
 just 
I mean, the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak, it takes a very, very long time. 
i mean
And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic. 
you see
GB: Well, thank you. 
well
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object, because there are only three characteristics that you can describe: the mass, the spin, and the charge. 
well
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole; I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes. 
okay
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale. 
 just 
if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars. 
 just 
Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes, but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers. 
 just 
You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique -- in other words, just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy, where we think the black hole is. 
 just 
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. 
 just 
Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars, they just should not be there. 
 just 
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters]. 
well
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages. 
well
These raised up platforms just like this stage. 
 just 
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe. 
well
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. 
you see
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. 
 just 
You can draw ground water from any well. 
well
But this is no ordinary well. 
well
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. 
 just 
Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor. 
 just 
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked. 
well
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. 
you see
A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables. 
well
Can you just encompass these people too? 
 just 
I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more. 
you see
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. 
 just 
I created something new, I was very excited because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles, but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. 
you know
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle? 
i mean
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems, which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles. 
well
You know, they might have a solution. 
you know
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies. 
well
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them. 
well
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. 
i mean
You know, you can do anything you want. 
you know
Or competitive games like chess where, well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle, but the goal really is to beat another player. 
well
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually. 
 just 
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda. 
 just 
Okay, let's go back to the slides. 
okay
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion, make the thing on the right. 
well
Well, you can't do that physically, but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C. 
well
And this follows the rules I just said: any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. 
 just 
I'll just go one step further. 
 just 
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle. 
well
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece. 
well
Okay, so how would you solve this one? 
okay
Well, move the blue one out of the way. 
well
You know? What do you do here? 
you know
And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas. 
 just 
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon. 
you know
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?" 
well
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. 
you know
First of all, you know, for a long time computer games meant things like "Doom," where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast, aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games. 
you know
Well, guess what? That's changing. 
well
Why? Well, we aging Boomers, Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food, we're exercising. What about our minds? 
well
Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer. 
 just 
This is your first time playing my game. Okay. 
okay
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. 
well
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that? 
okay
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and -- I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. 
i guess
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one. 
okay
Okay, so that's the lens. 
okay
And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend." 
 just 
And you know that Chris would say, "Thank you." 
you know
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick." 
well
 That one's gone as well. 
well
Thank you. Bruno's face, just then, he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't. 
 just 
Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug, now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us. 
well
Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. 
well
And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said. 
you know
 The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit. 
 just 
 "Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem." 
to be honest
I just, can I just say a few things about, first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady, my wife, with a wonderful smile. 
 just 
 "I just think, you know, what people forget, Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well. 
well
Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"  "You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said, 'Can I rely on your support for the next month?' And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.' Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before." 
you know
 When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, "Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises." 
well
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it. 
you know
And that's, you know, that's something --  And that's something we can relate to. 
you know
And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about. 
well
You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed. 
you see
And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. 
you know
You like that one? As opposed to you could see George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there? 
well
"Well, you know I'm sorry about that. 
well
I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well." 
well
 But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone. 
you know
That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act, just gone like that. 
 just 
"You know, it's the end of an error [sic]. 
you know
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?" 
you see
And Jack Nicholson just says, "You make me want to be a better man." 
 just 
And it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear," let's just point that out first. 
 just 
And that day, North Korea, that very day, North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan --  -- and land it before ... 
 just 
I just think that's important. I really do. 
 just 
And I, you know."  "So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you." 
you know
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery, it's created to look at American lives. 
 just 
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture. 
well
And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. 
 just 
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage, but they also have some disadvantages, but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. 
well
So, I thought okay, now, what is it going to take to make this work? 
okay
By the way, this was always done in public. 
by the way
And she said, "Well, something very weird was happening. 
well
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy, or empathy, at any rate, is what's critical to this kind of interview. 
okay
In fact, the first person I interviewed was George Abbott, who was 97, and Abbott was filled with the life force -- I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it. 
i guess
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up -- by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways. 
by the way
So, you know, you want energy, you want the life force, but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. 
you know
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months, and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there. 
 just 
And, in fact, when we did the interview -- I did the living self-portrait with her -- there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet, just enjoying her presence. 
 just 
And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake, because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes. 
 just 
She was 80, almost that day of the interview, and there she was and there I was, and I just proceeded into the questions. 
 just 
And then she turned to me and said, "And you know what those young actors did? 
you know
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?" 
you know
Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up, and this is just a brief reference. 
 just 
And he looked at me, you know, as if to say, "This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?" 
you know
And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints. 
 just 
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson, and by the way, at one point I asked him, "Would you like to have met him?" 
by the way
And he said, "Well, of course, but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him, because I got to read all of his letters." 
well
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him, and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent. 
well
But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so." 
well
He said, "You know, I've read everything, and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit." 
you know
He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface, so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation." 
 just 
At the time that I proposed to her that -- by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary -- but proposed to her that she come on. 
by the way
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori, and I change it all the time just because I want to." 
 just 
And the audience just -- you know, they're always on the side of the interviewee, and they felt that this was a kind of assault, but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. 
you know
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company, and in that process, she made a number of decisions. 
 just 
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see. 
well
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. 
well
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. 
well
We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of 
i mean
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready. 
you see
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. 
well
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less. 
i mean
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. 
well
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries? 
 just 
  So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. 
 just 
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well. 
well
 Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm. 
you know
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty. 
well
 That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl. 
by the way
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book. 
 just 
"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization. 
 just 
At the time of the phone call I just had a baby, I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with, and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons. 
 just 
Now, you know, if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money. 
you know
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism. 
you know
So, you see, what is the relationship? 
you see
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism. 
you know
I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers, including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family. 
well
You got to question everything that is told to you, including what I just told you today. 
 just 
And I decided that I had compromised, just like my friends in those discussions, where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for, rather than taking responsibility for. 
 just 
I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made, but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes, other substances and a woman. 
 just 
How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes? 
you know
During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright, and us as well. 
well
Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left, the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar. 
 just 
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months. 
 just 
Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign. 
well
They said, "No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting." 
 just 
Well, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. 
well
But this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool. 
 just 
and the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well. 
well
One of the great lessons Greenpeace learned is that it's OK to lose control, OK to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your goal. 
 ok 
That's the final message I want to share: you can do well online. 
well
But no longer is the message coming from just the top down. 
 just 
If you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control. 
 ok 
Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season, I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean, but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure. 
i mean
So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia. 
 just 
Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose. 
i suppose
Now, the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one, because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen, when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life, it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far. 
 just 
This is, it seems a bit dull you know. 
you know
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother? 
you know
Humans can dig holes and make a well. 
well
When do you see the dragonflies appear? 
you see
So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one, I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit, and that's okay, I know how they come here, but why do they come here? 
okay
Well, to cut a long story short, they're actually flying right across the ocean. 
well
I know because we have reports from Seychelles, which fit in as well, down here. 
well
Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are, the monsoon rains. 
okay
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa, where it's raining. 
 just 
Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought. 
 just 
It's, well, you can imagine. 
well
And the other thing, the other important factor for all these birds, all medium sized fellows, and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater. 
well
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns. 
 just 
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well. 
well
But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it. 
 just 
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. 
i guess
In the modern day world, where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough, the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. 
 just 
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place. 
well
Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated. 
 just 
I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here -- a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head? 
i mean
The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes. 
 just 
A set of people actually say, "Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it." 
 just 
SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees. 
well
I mean, this could be huge. 
i mean
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics. 
okay
But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition. 
you know
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy. 
 just 
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. 
well
If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption. 
 just 
And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way, is the lowest estimate of existing resources. 
you see
And just down the road, this is JET. 
 just 
But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. 
 just 
I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban-like beard, but also the richness and color of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams, as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell. 
 just 
Do you see me on the other side of this fence? 
you see
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth? 
you see
 Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here. 
 just 
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please? 
 just 
I just really wanted to acknowledge you. 
 just 
So, you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown, you have the non-obvious, you have the non-seen, for the people who don't dare to go through the ice. 
you see
Well, the unknown is part of life. 
well
Because in the balloon, like in life, we go very well in unforeseen directions. 
well
You know, when people speak about pioneering spirit, very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas. 
you know
We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas. 
 just 
Life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension. No. 
 just 
Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon, but in life itself. 
 just 
 And then he asked me -- and this is something I will never forget in my life -- he just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there. 
 just 
I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it. 
 just 
Well, solar power airplanes are not new. 
well
And there, there will be just one goal, just one: reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty. 
 just 
So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol. 
you see
But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. 
 just 
And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today, we can save between 30 and 50 percent of the energy of a country in Europe, and we can solve half of the rest with renewables. 
you know
You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing. 
 just 
So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side. 
you see
Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons. 
well
Well, why is that important? 
well
Well, let's take a look at the next slide. 
well
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent kill another polar bear, and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body, and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn, it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. 
 just 
And that is, there are mirror neurons, just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch. 
 just 
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin, touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched. 
well
Okay, so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. 
okay
You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet, you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. 
 just 
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time. 
 just 
So, using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often. 
 just 
And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it. 
well
It's not just Topshop, I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props. 
 just 
Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton. 
okay
But I just like it in bright orange. 
 just 
And it's just a bit spooky. 
 just 
 It's so basic. It just grows wild. 
 just 
It's just happening. 
 just 
 If you look at this, just the tube, it is quite bright. 
 just 
Well, this year is the 50th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars. 
well
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car, you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works. 
you see
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes, those brain cells die, they never come back. 
 just 
Well, the same things happen to our cells. 
well
Well, the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body, my body, your body, is about 90 years, a little bit more for women. 
well
You go into the bars in Sardinia, instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar, you see the centenarian of the month calendar. 
you see
They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating, which, as you know, is a big problem here in America. 
you know
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does. 
 just 
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born, because of infant mortality, and the year you retire. 
you know
And by the way, if I come across as a sort of rabid, hippie conservationist, it's purely a figment of your imagination. 
by the way
 Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival. 
okay
And, of course, watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers, but for several other reasons as well. 
well
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long. 
 just 
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe. 
 just 
It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans, you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed. 
you know
It's just a wresting match, but a remarkable activity. 
 just 
Well, the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests. 
well
And, just like Project Tiger, our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it. 
 just 
Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it, we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides. 
well
And the thing is, it's not just big industry. 
 just 
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north. 
okay
It is an animal which has been on the Earth for just about 100 million years. 
 just 
In fact, if you see the map, the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan And now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India. 
you see
I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again. 
 just 
Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight. 
 just 
This was actually just taken last year. 
 just 
And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine. 
 just 
It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra, and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine. 
 just 
And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected, including us. 
you know
You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well. 
well
Animals like the Ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left, and it is also critically endangered. 
 just 
And development just basically going berserk, for a double figure growth index, basically. 
 just 
And the thing is, you know, the decision makers, the folks in power, they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi, in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool. 
you know
But if you stroll down to the Yamuna or to the Gomati in Lucknow, or to the Adyar river in Chennai, or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune, just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad. 
 just 
You know, most people are terrified of snakes. 
you know
Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach, I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly. 
i guess
As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know? 
you know
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each, and they are used for bear paw soup, and also being trained, later on, to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. 
 just 
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund. 
okay
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that. 
 just 
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was. 
 just 
And that directly increased student wellbeing. 
well
And once that happened, they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished. 
 just 
But we had parents who said, "Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English? 
well
When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well, in fact very well, as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science. 
well
I mean, it was incredible. 
i mean
I mean, they were changing lives. 
i mean
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal. 
 just 
 Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing. 
you know
 Oh, man. Um, yes. 
 um
That's not my slides, but it's okay. 
okay
And this is all done, by the way, by the International Astronomical Union. 
by the way
 "Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy! 
 oh 
 I mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong. 
i mean
Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures." 
 just 
And you know they're international because they put it "en Francais" as well. 
well
Getting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way, because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights. 
by the way
By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn, no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful. 
 just 
You see the icosahedron again. 
you see
And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other. 
 just 
I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are, without heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless. 
 just 
I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid. 
i mean
Descartes.  Before the horse.  Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around. 
 just 
 Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted. 
 just 
And I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude, could you touch your tooth? That's good." 
okay
 And that didn't work out well. 
well
I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing. 
 just 
Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen. 
 just 
 You can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up, and it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out." 
 oh 
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. 
 just 
 Look at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up. 
i mean
Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me. 
 just 
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden. 
 just 
 You know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way. 
you know
You know, try making some charts like this at home. 
you know
These are maps, by the way. 
by the way
 Okay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy. 
okay
So, I began, early on, competing against the other kids, seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe, you know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath. 
you know
You know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath. 
you know
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn't in my body, and just control that. 
 just 
Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath, and just hold and relax and never let any air out, and just hold and relax through all the pain. 
 just 
And by eating so well and training so hard, my resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute. 
well
Two days before my big breath-hold attempt, for the record, the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath, and almost drowning, is too boring for television. 
 just 
So, every time my heart would beat, I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep, you know, the ticking, really loud. 
you know
I was just sitting there thinking, "I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail." 
 just 
And the heart rate just kept going up and up, all the way up to 150 beats. 
 just 
 So, I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out, at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that. 
 just 
But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop, just waiting. 
 just 
They had doctors with the "Pst," you know, sitting there waiting. 
you know
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. 
well
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant, while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison, the Chief of Urology at Harvard, actually harvesting the kidney. 
well
We're just getting older. 
 just 
So, that's a challenge, not just for organs but also for tissues. 
 just 
You see here a little video. 
you see
You see the scar form. 
you see
How does this work? Well, on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured. 
well
And you see that it is injured. 
you see
That's exactly what you see here. 
you see
And then, six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra. 
you see
Okay. These are flat structures that we see here, the muscle. 
okay
Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex. 
 just 
For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large. 
 just 
And instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge -- we just use cells. 
 just 
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print, and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. 
you see
So, for example on the left panel, top panel, you see a liver. 
you see
You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good, everything works. Actually no, these technologies really are not that easy. 
you know
And there you see the stagecoach driver, and he goes, on the top panel, He goes A, B, C, D, E, F. 
you see
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic, we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. 
i mean
So, we have patients now walking around with organs, engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well. 
well
We are just taking five seconds. 
 just 
And now I can just go and go out with my friends, go do whatever I want. 
 just 
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?" 
well
Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part. 
well
And you know why I understand that? 
you know
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right? 
i mean
Well, it can mean a lot of things. 
well
Just think about that, you know, wander through your life thinking about this. 
you know
Well, when I have done this on myself, I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places. 
well
You know, breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and methane gas, in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this. 
you know
Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown. 
well
Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now, breathing various concentrations of that. 
okay
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation. 
okay
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about. 
you know
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here. 
well
Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places. Right? 
well
Did you know that data existed? 
you know
This might be what we end up with. This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right? 
 just 
And he looks at that and he says, "Whoa Bill, I suggest that maybe you not decide, just because you're out here in beautiful California, and it's warm every day, that you get out and run at six o'clock at night. 
 just 
Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information. 
okay
Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago. 
 just 
of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about, was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness, and how our healthcare system actually operates. 
well
What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again, not just represent things. 
 just 
Well, how about instead of doing that, we roll up to the gates something they want. 
well
Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room-- well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room. 
well
And that's a project that is just about to open next week, the new home for the Dallas Theater Center, the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre. 
 just 
This building, when an artistic director wanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage, they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole. 
well
Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions around the world. 
well
The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb. 
 just 
Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture. 
well
The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage, and the seats come in. 
you see
Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space. 
you see
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. 
you see
The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house. 
you know
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium. 
well
Here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil. 
you see
And last but not least, you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem. 
you see
And think of it being done with just a few people. 
 just 
Again, just a couple people are required. 
 just 
 So, just in conclusion, a few shots. 
 just 
And it's in men as well as in women. 
well
which was, by the way, patriarchy. 
by the way
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. 
well
But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, who are literally being treated like ashtrays. 
 just 
But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24, they are they key, really, in the developing world, as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity. 
well
And what I want to suggest is that, having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called "I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World," I've been talking to girls for five years, and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb "to please." 
 just 
There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face. 
 just 
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist. 
 just 
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya. 
 just 
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her, and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster." 
well
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?" 
okay
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house." 
well
In that hut, we walked in, and her father and his four wives were sitting there, and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled, and her primary mother, who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders. 
 just 
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl. 
 just 
 And you know what? Sometimes it should. 
you know
What you see here is a premature baby. 
you see
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. 
 just 
As a result, parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies, or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. 
you see
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha, who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani. 
 just 
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator. 
you see
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street. 
well
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names. 
well
Streets have names; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets." 
 just 
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16." 
well
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names. 
well
All of these blocks have names, and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. 
 just 
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight. 
well
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music: two, three, four, one. 
 just 
Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts to those people. 
well
Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well, the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn. 
well
Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting -- it's not unique to diarrhea. 
well
It's not just medicine. 
 just 
Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked. 
well
Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this -- is to say, "That's just stupid." 
well
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world. 
 just 
I'm going to give you a little math problem, and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible. 
 just 
I just want you to name the color of the object. 
 just 
You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world, some models that you use to understand the world. 
you see
These models, like the leaky bucket, work well in most situations. 
well
I suspect most of you -- I hope that's true for the rest of you -- actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world. 
well
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests." 
well
The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay? 
okay
And they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?" 
you know
Okay, back to BMW. What should they do? 
okay
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it, you know, I would obviously use it every day." 
well
You just gotta carry this thing around. 
 just 
Anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence, just as a result of this. 
 just 
You see, we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem. 
you see
What this company does is they send a letter to households that say, "Here's your energy use, here's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face. 
well
And what they find is just this letter, nothing else, has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. 
 just 
But you know what we need to combine it with? 
you know
But you know what we do on the last mile? 
you know
I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically, what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time. 
i mean
That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign. 
 just 
And then we say, "Well, you want to get this behavior change. 
well
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS, which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years. 
 just 
Because, as we all know here today, it doesn't work very well. 
well
But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story, and go to something more. 
 just 
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed, as he was in that pool, he could not walk, he could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them, did you see those? -- he was happy. We were at the beach, he was raising his son, and he was productive. 
you see
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems. 
 just 
I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this data and make something even better. 
 just 
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs, and all of the things that interact among those, the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it, so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model I don't even know what a medical record is. 
 just 
So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly. 
you know
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM, can you guys tell us whether this works or not?" 
you know
And we went around and we talked to people, and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know? 
you know
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder." 
well
So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto, That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time to build our own. This is a real app by the way. 
by the way
This is not just graphics. 
 just 
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?" 
well
But you know, a lot of people dropped out, the trial, there is too much drop out. 
you know
We asked our control algorithm, are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial -- can we look at those patients and say, "Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them, and what happens?" 
 just 
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you that for those 69 people that took lithium, they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them, and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study. 
 just 
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him. 
i mean
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time? 
you see
And, you know, I look at this, and I get really emotional. 
you know
Let me just give you two examples. 
 just 
So, you see two examples here. 
you see
What you see here is a prototypic device. 
you see
It's made of paper and paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth, and the wine wicks all over everything. 
you know
It just -- you don't want to do that. 
 just 
So, it works very well there, but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information. 
well
 He was telling the truth. Because in a different culture, the dog is a surrogate for you, you know, "today," "this month," "since the rainy season" -- there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding, and so an issue here is to, in some cases, to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting, Now, take a look at what a typical test looks like. 
you know
You can't manipulate it very well, although I'll show something about that in a moment. 
well
You don't have to send out a doctor, you send out somebody who can just take the sample, and in the clinic either a doctor, or ideally a computer in this case, does the analysis. 
 just 
Turns out to work actually quite well, particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work. 
well
How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars And the answer is not complicated but it's one which I don't want to go through here, other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood. 
well
All right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices. 
 just 
What you see here is another centimeter-sized device, and the different colors are different colors of dye. 
you see
And what you see, at the lower right-hand side there, is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top, and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom, in a piece of paper -- basically it looks like a chip, two pieces of paper thick. 
you see
And in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that. 
 just 
It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes, and turns color, and all done with paper and carpet tape. 
well
It works really, really well. 
well
Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor, they stick a needle in. 
well
So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle. 
 just 
You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer. 
well
You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease. 
you know
But, if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more, then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you. 
 just 
You know, in the mid-1850's in France, they started to describe cancer by body part. 
you know
So, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it, and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded. 
you see
You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver. 
you see
You know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. 
you know
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days, and I asked, "What was the average temperature?" 
you know
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months. 
you know
And so, the problem is that it's not just one system, it's multiple systems on multiple scales. 
 just 
Well, the bad news is that these robust -- and robust is a key word -- emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. 
well
So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well. 
well
Well, remember that's not even an order of magnitude, but that's a different story. 
well
So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system, just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence, chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. 
 just 
 And so, what do you know, that drug was approved. 
you know
And so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office -- well, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right? 
well
So, just for two seconds, how these technologies work -- because I think it's important to understand it. 
 just 
And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter, without fundamental learning. 
 just 
You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel -- and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual. 
you know
Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work? 
you see
And so for me, it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context, as though you were an astronaut, and see these two things as an object, because they are so intimately bound, and one is meaningless without the other. 
 just 
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects -- like that silver one there, that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets, trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. 
well
So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that. 
 just 
JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise. 
 just 
I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin, even though the forces can be calculated. 
i mean
And if you put them together in different combinations -- just like printing in a sense, like how a magazine color is printed -- and put them under certain forces, which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them, these amazing things started appearing. 
 just 
TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases. 
well
I can redeem this painting, just continuing on, doing layers upon layers. 
 just 
TS: Well, this painting here, I wanted to do something very simple, a simple, iconic image of two ripples interfering. 
well
What it's also about, just the little events, the events of the interpenetration of -- JH: Two stars, or -- TS: Two things that happened -- there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens. 
 just 
There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening, and I'm very interested in that. 
 just 
If I throw a very concentric circle, or concentric ellipse, it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines, which get closer and closer together, which describes how gravity works. 
 just 
And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are, but they're equally well-resolved and complex. 
well
at this stage in your life, you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant -- I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. 
i suppose
I mean, I've got the symptoms. 
i mean
I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years, but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. 
i guess
All my creations really start on small drawings, which I have thousands of, and it's my way of just thinking. 
 just 
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend. 
well
It just has so much in it. 
 just 
And to interface with it, with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do, giving them pigment and paint just like an artist, it's a good ally. 
 just 
And I think corruption, and the fight against corruption, and the impact of corruption, is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance. 
i mean
The good projects, which we as a donor community would take under our wings, they took years, you know, you had too many studies, and very often they didn't succeed. 
you know
The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay, including Germany. 
okay
So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure, because even the powerful government, which we have in Germany, comparatively, was not able to say, "We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad." 
i mean
 Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting, in doing this, we had to sit together with the companies. 
well
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way, chaired one of the sessions, the first one, to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs, who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations. 
by the way
Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. 
 just 
Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today? 
 just 
You can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well. 
well
Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook at home or at school. 
well
But you know what? Her father, who was obese, died in her arms, And then the second most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. 
you know
You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters. 
you see
By the way, this is what they get buried in. 
by the way
Well, modern-day life. 
well
Supermarkets as well. 
well
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story. 
you know
And you know, as we go to work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have to look at it holistically -- step back for a moment, and re-address the balance. 
you know
But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. 
you know
You know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK? 
you know
You know, the amount of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe -- there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. 
you know
And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff. 
by the way
Do you know what that is? 
you know
Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well. 
well
Do you know what I mean? 
you know
So, let me just show you. 
 just 
We've got one kid, here -- having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day. 
you know
You know, there's your week. 
you know
And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar, just from milk. 
 just 
So, let's just think about, we got a problem here, we need to reboot. 
 just 
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do? 
okay
Here is the thing, right, it cannot just come from one source. 
 just 
To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say, "In 10 years' time, the history of your children's lives, happiness -- and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?" 
well
Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. 
 just 
The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education at the heart of their businesses. 
you know
With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive. 
you know
I mean, basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z, and everyone loves them, right? 
i mean
You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff. 
you know
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay? 
okay
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people. 
you know
We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they're already doing, and doing well. 
well
And I thought, "You know what? 
you know
I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America." 
 just 
So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. 
 just 
Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. 
 just 
Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them. 
 just 
If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. 
 just 
Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. 
well
And so, when you fly down --  Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, 
you see
And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. 
well
But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. 
 just 
Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. 
 just 
 All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. 
 just 
And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. 
well
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. 
by the way
and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do." 
well
But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being -- things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values -- then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics. 
well
And the really simple argument I want to make tonight, the really straightforward argument is this: That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking, with the incredible information revolution that has taken place, and that all of you know so much more about than I do, I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics, remake government, remake public services, and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being. 
well
Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics, some of which we were just hearing about, again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being, in happiness, in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money. 
well
Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples, but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change. 
well
Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference: in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability, in giving us that genuine people power. 
well
We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today -- available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are, what the conditions are, driving huge value for money, but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well. 
well
Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love. 
 just 
Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home. 
well
I want to talk about my investigations into what technology means in our lives -- not just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense, in the kind of long history of the world and our place in the world: What is this stuff? 
 just 
But we know that it's just not new. 
 just 
If we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today -- and I mean everything, from blades to scrapers to cloth -- we as a species would not live very long. 
i mean
Well, that's because they're all young. 
well
What's new is just the degree of it. Even during the agricultural age there was climate change. 
 just 
It's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops. 
 just 
What I would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going, we continue that trajectory, and we say "Well what's going to become more energy-dense, that's where it's going." And so what I've done is, I've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say, "What are the general trends in evolutionary life?" 
well
In fact, technology is accelerating all the aspects of life, and we can see that happening; just as there's diversity in life, there's more diversity in things we make. 
 just 
You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests, you try to anticipate it, but after anticipating it, you constantly asses it, not just once, but eternally. 
 just 
And when it diverts from what you want, we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff, but the old stuff. 
 just 
And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it. 
i mean
 There are no bad technologies, just as there are no bad children. 
 just 
We just have to find them the right place. 
 just 
So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket. 
 just 
It's more than just gadgets; it's more than just things that people invent. 
 just 
Well, law is also a powerful driver of human behavior. 
well
But it's not just business that's affected by this, it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. 
 just 
She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent when he turned the paper in late. 
 just 
She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this." 
 just 
It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible; and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time. 
you see
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said, "Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. 
well
Well, the healthcare system has been transformed: a culture pervaded with defensiveness, universal distrust of the system of justice, universal practice of defensive medicine. 
well
The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine." 
well
Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine and others. Turns out that's not the case. 
well
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law. 
well
It doesn't seem to be working very well does it? 
well
Well, actually there is a reason: Environmental review has evolved into a process for any major project taking the better part of a decade, then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. 
well
Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second, people are acting like idiots,  all across the country. 
 just 
I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure. 
 just 
Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle. 
well
But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law, because the hurdle for success is trust. 
 just 
It drives people from the smart part of the brain -- that dark, deep well of the subconscious, where instincts and experience, and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are -- it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic. 
well
Pretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI." 
well
So, what's needed is not just to limit claims, but actually create a dry ground of freedom. 
 just 
Worked pretty well for 200 years. 
well
But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody, not just on the disgruntled person. 
 just 
But that's just the beginning. 
 just 
And this is ability, in real time, to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid. 
well
So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics -- the key measurements of vital signs, and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone. 
 just 
Now, how does this work? Well, there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist. 
well
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway, as today many of these things are dedicated gateways, because they are not so well integrated. 
well
This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm, as you saw already, but it also goes well beyond that. 
well
And why is this important? Well, this is the most expensive bed. 
well
Well, we can. First of all, heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country. 
well
So, can we improve that? Well the idea is we take this device that I'm wearing, and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure, randomly assigned, versus 600 patients who don't have active monitoring, and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions, and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial, and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that, but that's a type of wireless device trial 
well
Let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it: 1.2 million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod. 
 just 
Well, I tried this device. 
well
And I want to just give you the results of that testing, because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement. 
 just 
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better -- I hope so. 
by the way
Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work, I mean, this just doesn't work. 
 just 
Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG at your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way? 
by the way
Okay, well this was a week of my life in sleeping, and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score, you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up. 
well
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd. 
you see
And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times, and it isn't looking good. 
 just 
So, let me just give you, very quickly, 10 top targets for wireless medicine. 
 just 
Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension: 74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention. And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that. 
 just 
One of the ones I just wanted to mention: The iShoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling. 
 just 
 Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible, and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open. It looks like this, this whole building dedicated. 
 just 
And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era: to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate -- and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany, it was announced on Monday -- then to move up with development, clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice, the most challenging thing of all, requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics. 
 just 
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. 
 just 
When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism? 
 just 
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. 
i mean
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things, you know, that Bill Gates talked about this morning. 
you know
Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details. 
well
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures. 
 just 
And they just kind of come up, kind of like this. 
 just 
And they come up one at a time, and then I think, "OK, well maybe we can have it snow, or we can have a thunderstorm," and I can hold it there and turn them into videos. 
well
But, one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind, just like a virtual reality computer system. 
 just 
That was like just so super cool. 
 just 
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker's just one kind of mind. 
 just 
You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind -- good at one thing, bad at something else. 
you see
You know, it's going to be variable. 
you know
You see, it's a different picture. 
you see
See, I want you to think about just how specific this is. 
 just 
Let's just look at something like, you know, solving problems with making airlines safer. 
you know
You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years, the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way. 
you know
You know, now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that specific information. 
you know
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy, as I travel around and I do autism meetings, is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids, and they just aren't very social, and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science. 
 just 
I was a goofball student. When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying, until I had Mr. Carlock's science class. 
 just 
You know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED, and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on. 
you know
I mean art was my best subject in school. 
i mean
But you know what? I was getting work experience. 
you know
You know, how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party. 
you know
You know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little. 
you know
My mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else." 
well
I really get fed up when they, you know, the teachers, especially when you get away from this part of the country, they don't know what to do with these smart kids. 
you know
It just drives me crazy. 
 just 
It's just kind of -- you just have to learn it. 
 just 
Mentors are just essential. 
 just 
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies, the thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind, you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say, "Design new software." 
 just 
You've got to tell them something a lot more specific: "Well, we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing. 
well
Well, that's the end of my talk. 
well
And I just want to thank everybody for coming. 
 just 
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote, "If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave." 
you know
 CA: So, I want to ask you a couple other questions, and if any of these feel inappropriate, it's okay just to say, "Next question." 
 just 
TG: Well, first of all, you've got to look at age. 
well
If you have a two, three or four year old you know, no speech, no social interaction, Don't wait, you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching. 
you know
You know, the thing is, autism comes in different degrees. 
you know
TG: Well let me tell you, that child will be loyal, and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it. 
well
You know, the slaughter plants, I've worked with them in the '80s; they were absolutely awful. 
you know
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down? 
 just 
It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world. We need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff. 
well
TG: Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that, it contains knowledge. 
well
CA: Temple, can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED. 
 just 
TG: Well thank you so much. Thank you. 
well
In fact, if you were to be treated, you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates. 
well
As a new father, I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are, what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child. 
 just 
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius, and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong. 
 just 
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age, it loses its ability to learn -- that doesn't sit well with me, because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately. 
well
It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center, which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. 
well
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts, so opacities of the lens. 
you see
We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right, SRD, and she got her sight late in life, and her vision is remarkable at this age. 
you see
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown, but inspiring story. 
 just 
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left, be it a real image or a synthetic image, it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column, regions of different colors, different luminances. 
you see
The brain has this complex task of putting together, integrating, subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful, into what we would consider to be objects, as you see on the right. 
you see
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago, and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT, running the experiment with him. 
you see
When you ask them, "Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are," these are the regions that they point to. 
 just 
Doctor: What shape do you see here? 
you see
And let me just quickly mention two, one, drawing from the domain of engineering, and one from the clinic. 
 just 
Here, I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan. 
 just 
So, given that kind of video input, with just about six or seven minutes worth of video, Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. 
 just 
This is the neurotypical child, and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go. 
you see
And for my students and I, it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research, while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with. 
 just 
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity. 
you know
And, you know, just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here, and if you had to meet Bush, it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. 
you know
I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards, but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. 
 just 
That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful, art comes with responsibility. 
you know
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes. 
you know
Forget it, they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. 
you know
You know, normally you work in isolation, and you show at a gallery, but here, the work was coming alive, and it had some other artists working with me. 
you know
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us, all the people who bought our work." 
 just 
And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children, the best way to have a new lease on life, is to have a child. 
you know
You know I sat at home and I watched. 
you know
And this was just eight months ago. 
 just 
You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy. 
you know
 These are just different cartoons. 
 just 
So I said, okay. 
okay
So, what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's -- maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera, which is cricket. 
 just 
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what? 
you know
 The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it? 
well
But slowly the game moved on, you know, finally. 
you know
The scripted one is what you see in the movies, the real one was cricket. 
you see
 And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see. 
you see
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine, we just took it straight away, as is. 
 just 
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled, 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years, and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities, but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues. 
i mean
So, just to give you an example of how they did it -- not Manchester United style promotion, but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. 
 just 
And I just thought to myself, "Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know? 
you know
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team -- as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well, you got a hug from Preity Zinta. 
well
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look -- everyone's watching Preity Zinta. 
well
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said? 
you know
Because we had this auction, you see. 
you see
But we did it. You know why? 
you know
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India." 
you know
And that felt good, you know? 
you know
I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities. 
i mean
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music. 
 just 
It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore, and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. 
 just 
I got my name just because I was so young. 
 just 
  L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy. 
 just 
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in. 
you see
And you just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating it. 
 just 
You know, you create power, then you tame it. 
you know
We're just going to spend a minute on this. 
 just 
But it isn't: it's just a mental model, and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something. 
 just 
"Oh, well, I thought if I became CEO it would help, but now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO. 
well
Oh no, the rainbow off-center was just fine. 
 just 
The tree with its crooked branches was just fine. 
 just 
And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was, your habitual-wanting self dropped away, and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced, and you felt it. 
 just 
You know, we are here and we want to have something. 
you know
You know, many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful. 
you know
Like there was a friend of mine who said, "Gee, you know, I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife, and this has to change." 
you know
And this was his way of showing, you know, I care for you, and nice things would happen. 
you know
 "And furthermore, don't you know I never wear this kind of thing?" 
you know
And the next thing you know, he had a full-blown marital spat. 
you know
Well, we live in a world where what we think of, what we invest in, is the outcome. 
well
We invest in the outcome, and as I've just pointed out, the outcome is frequently different from what we would like, and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like. 
 just 
Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well-being. 
well
What happens, and this happens typically between 11 and 13 months, is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking, she wants to walk, she gets up, she falls down, she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her, kisses the place, makes it well. 
well
And you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting. 
you know
But if, on the other hand, we said, "Here is the outcome, I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could," every day is a blast, and you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you. 
well
And they invariably come up with, you know, here is a list of things. 
you know
It's just a breeze, because all you do in your life is you take journeys. 
 just 
There's nothing wrong with that, but just ask yourself, "Is this a journey I want to take? 
 just 
So, today I'm back just to show you a few things, to show you, in fact, there is an open data movement afoot, now, around the world. 
 just 
A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up, was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED -- Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government, blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is, it's about bicycle accidents." 
 just 
Here's more data, traffic survey data, again, put out by the U.K. government, and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards, then a user could just make a map, just by clicking. 
 just 
Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008. 
well
Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt, between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either. 
well
Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places you can take, from a postcode -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses, you can make paper, print off a paper which has got very, very specific things about the bus stops, the things specifically near you. 
well
Fortunately, just after the earthquake, GeoEye, a commercial company, released satellite imagery with a license, which allowed the open-source community to use it. 
 just 
So, if you've been involved in that at all, I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing, whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!" 
 just 
or you've been putting government or scientific data online, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much, and we have only just started! 
 just 
And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle -- it's also about the road. 
 just 
But that's just safety. 
 just 
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution, wear on the car, and time. 
 just 
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. 
well
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction. 
 just 
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction? 
i mean
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way. 
well
 you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements. 
you know
And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much. 
 just 
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit. 
 just 
Okay. This is Camp One. 
okay
This is not good weather to climb in, so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down. 
 just 
All the climbers here are climbing unroped, and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody, you'd wind up just pulling them off with you. 
 just 
We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three. 
 just 
There's no chance of saving him, and just try to save yourself at this point." 
 just 
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four. 
 just 
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated, I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain. 
well
It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there. 
 just 
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. 
 just 
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers, who we had already been told was dead, stumbled into the tent, just like a mummy, he walked into the tent. 
 just 
It's the last stage, just like a scar. 
 just 
He said he had gotten lost in the storm, collapsed in the snow, and just laid there, unable to move. 
 just 
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. 
you see
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going, and, you see, there's no more red here; his brain is quieting down. 
you see
So what do I mean when I say "suspended animation"? 
i mean
Those of you with children, you know about them. 
you know
You just open the bag, and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium, and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around. 
 just 
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming. 
well
So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird, little organisms. 
 just 
The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her. 
well
She got cranky and just went home. 
 just 
Well, I have to tell you something very odd, and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. 
well
You know? 
you know
Well, we had a lot of them. 
well
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it. 
 just 
I mean, who knows? 
i mean
And one of the things we wondered -- I'm sure some of you out there are economists, and you know all about supply and demand. 
you know
So, what I just told you is we can now reduce demand. 
 just 
And with money we got from DARPA, we could show just that. 
 just 
In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned, which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this. 
 just 
You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them, it's really confusing. 
 just 
We hope not, or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common. 
 just 
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network, we fly and study them as well. 
well
You know, back in 2000, we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers, and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000, that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. 
you know
Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here. 
well
I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here, and we're not doing anything about it. 
i mean
I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. 
i mean
You know, this is the mainframe. 
you know
And just as 30 years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts, that we're carrying around in our cell phone today, and suddenly, computing, that used to be an expert driven system, it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing 
 just 
How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data, psychological data, relational data, in and on and around the home? 
 just 
These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies. 
 just 
It's just a mess today. 
 just 
So, you know, that's my last message to you. 
you know
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth." 
 just 
You know, simple words lost in the quicksand of experience. 
you know
It's my one way of getting rid of my mind, getting rid of this mind that says, "Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing. 
you know
And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says, "You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do." 
you know
And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan because he's chaotic. 
 just 
[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it because that's what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness. 
 just 
At school I was being just taught about physics, and I was told that if there is something that exists, then it is measurable. 
 just 
But the divine one was unjust, so the gods said, "OK, what we need to do is help the just one." 
 just 
And so they helped the just one. 
 just 
The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well. 
well
She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. 
well
About ten years ago, I heard this little thing from a politician, not a politician that was very well respected in India. 
well
And, because democracy still exists, there's a democratic way in which you say "Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water." 
well
So, okay my time is up. 
okay
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures. 
well
Now, the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim: This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. 
well
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life, for human beings, we know that there is a continuum of such facts. 
well
But if we're going to talk about human well-being we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain. 
well
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape, with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective. 
well
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access. 
well
 But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them. 
well
And just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality, and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future. 
 just 
Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined, and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed. 
well
And so, how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being? 
well
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health. 
well
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years. 
 just 
Well think of how we talk about food: I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. 
well
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie, and if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth. 
well
Well this is one thing you can do about them: You can cover them up. 
well
Well, who are we not to say this? 
well
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this? 
well
I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children? 
i mean
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being. 
well
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types. 
well
 Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. 
well
 Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist; I don't understand string theory. 
well
But this is just the point. 
 just 
 How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being? 
well
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads, or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. 
well
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world, hearing some of this, may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them. 
well
And some of them would say something else. They would say, "No, you know, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" -- and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view -- "that male lust is not to be trusted." 
you know
I mean, can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist? 
i mean
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking, but the question is: What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself? 
well
And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. 
to be honest
It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women. 
well
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. 
i mean
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems? 
 just 
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact, in the context of a truly delusional belief system. 
well
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context. 
well
We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health, behavior, inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations, then technically responsible releases are possible, both for the well-being of the individual, and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems, because we will be returning genes for these populations -- which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges -- and also we could be returning 
well
Now, I went one step further and said, "Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document? Let's go online." 
 just 
Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents. 
you see
But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. 
 just 
When this picture appeared, that well-known scientific journal, The New York Times, wrote in its editorial, "Mars is uninteresting. 
well
This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. 
 just 
Well, we have an idea. 
well
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix, we just put two years ago. 
 just 
We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. 
well
We believe that in a one-hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere, looking for gases of biogenic origin, looking for gases of volcanic origin, studying the surface, studying the magnetism on the surface, which we don't understand, as well as about a dozen other areas. 
well
And we've done high-altitude and low-altitude tests, just to perfect this technique. 
 just 
You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London. 
you know
Well, if you teach, if you worship in the temple of learning, do not mock the gods, because they will take you, fill you with curiosity and desire, and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. 
well
Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. 
well
Well, it builds up with these factors. 
well
Being numerous does not make you a slave. Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world, caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts, kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it. 
you know
Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world. 
well
I just want to share a little clip for you. 
 just 
BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. 
well
Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. 
 oh 
Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof. 
okay
You buy them cheaply, you use them, you crumple them up, and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. 
 just 
One of their mothers said to us, "You know, we can't survive here, but we can't even seem to die either." 
you know
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. 
well
Well, amazingly, in places like India where costs are very low, that family, that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery -- so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery -- but the total cost, amortized across the rest of the work, was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. 
well
And that means, when you multiply it up, the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery is something like 10.8 billion dollars -- what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels, what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system: usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans, or in the last holiday period 
 just 
It's just not going to happen. 
 just 
Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana, reunited with their parents, and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become slave-proof -- absolutely unenslaveable. 
well
They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. 
 just 
They'd just begun to light up a little bit, open up a little bit. 
 just 
Okay, we have to ask ourselves, are we willing to live in a world with slavery? 
okay
And you know what? If we can't do that, if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery, there is one last question: Are we truly free? 
you know
Okay, thank you so much. 
okay
You know, by the way, there are two million people in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums. 
you know
But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. 
well
I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. 
i mean
I like Ducati ZZ143, because it is the fastest, the world's fastest bike, and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.  Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw, her father sells flowers on the roadside. 
well
You know, when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible, the ICSE curriculum. 
you know
Not only do our children cope very well, but they excel in it. 
well
You should just come across to see how well our children do. 
well
We have, a few months ago, actually late last year, we had a few mothers who came to us and said, "You know, we want to learn how to read and write. 
you know
We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. 
 just 
That's just one source. 
 just 
And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside. 
by the way
Okay, that was kind of cool. 
okay
 But the top story of this past year was the economy, and I'm just betting that, sooner or later, this particular recession is going to be old news. 
 just 
First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. 
you know
It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader. 
 just 
So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement, not you.  Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here. 
okay
Well, Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust. 
well
Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals can be a burden, because you know that if everything were free, then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. 
you know
If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I established on her last loan, I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me, until she pays it back.  True story, by the way. 
by the way
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that, but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ-fighters, when lots of other kids were hearing "The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round." 
okay
Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules. 
well
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published, or saying wait until you're older, my parents were really supportive. 
 just 
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here. 
you see
Kids grow up and become adults just like you. 
 just 
 Or just like you? Really? 
 just 
No, just kidding.  No, really, we are going to be the next generation, the ones who will bring this world forward. 
 just 
And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you, remember that cloning is possible, and that involves going through childhood again, in which case you'll want to be heard, just like my generation. 
 just 
Well, one or two brave souls. 
well
Please let there be some left.'" And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid." 
you know
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy. 
you know
in three cities in Indonesia, and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?" 
well
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles. 
i mean
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?" 
you know
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing. 
 just 
Now, the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher. 
well
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this. 
well
Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex. 
well
 Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. 
okay
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex. 
 just 
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives. 
well
So, if you look at the viremia thing again, if you do start treatment when you're sick, well, what happens? Your viral load comes down. 
well
Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero. 
well
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy. 
well
Let's just stop treating people." 
 just 
And what we've seen is that, actually, condom use rates, which were very, very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV, with extremely little help from public health nerds, I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really: One is the assumption of, "Oh well, if he's infected, he's probably on meds, and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe." 
well
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program. 
you see
Well, of course, because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc. 
well
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well. 
well
Okay, Ines. 
okay
They were quite proud of the fact that you know, before the dust clears, if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back, they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. 
you know
"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame -- namely 32 inches from the long finger -- and weigh less than nine pounds." 
by the way
And just as in the spirit of FIRST, gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this, so they decide to share a drink. 
 just 
This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way. 
by the way
"Well, would it help if I ..." 
well
And he said, "You know, I'm the lucky guy at this table. 
you know
 Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them. 
 just 
There were 3,500 people, the Veteran's Administration, U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event to help the families of all the kids -- some that have died, some that are like Brandon -- and they wanted me to speak. 
 just 
But universally, these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes, and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them. 
 just 
I don't think anybody does it intentionally, but there were people there literally talking about, "Well, how much will they get?" 
well
You know, this country is involved as we've all heard, in this great healthcare debate. 
you know
But I was saying to him, "You know, the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903. 
you know
But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous. 
you know
But have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs? 
you see
So, you know H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds," novel and movie. 
well
I'm just going to show you how the robot works. 
 just 
You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body, just like a pendulum. 
 just 
What you see over here, this is what we want to do next. 
you see
What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.  This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall, it's 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things. 
you see
The problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors, you know, aligning the joints, and those kinds of things. 
you know
And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses over these type of terrain. 
 just 
We just simply change the length of the spoke. 
 just 
So, these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS. 
 just 
Also for search and rescue applications as well. 
well
Now, we don't have enough time to go into technical details, I'll just show you some of the experiments. 
 just 
We do something to something And just like magic, it moves. The blob. 
 just 
The problem is they're just too expensive, tens of thousands of dollars. 
 just 
It is compliant. You can actually change the force, simply just changing the air pressure. 
 just 
So, for example in Iraq, you know, the war zone, there is roadside bombs. Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed. 
you know
In this case it's very intuitive; this student, probably his first time using it, doing very complex manipulation tasks, picking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that. Very intuitive. 
 just 
As you know, we are very interested in humanoid robot, human walking, so we decided to build a small humanoid robot. 
you know
For those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances, you know what happens. 
you know
However, still, as you can see, it has a cord, umbilical cord. So, we're still using an external power source and external computation. 
 um
What you see over here, this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. 
you see
These are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things. 
 just 
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough. 
 just 
They have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas, and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy. 
 just 
Well, we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is, you know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough. 
well
Well, actually, there are two sides to the story. 
well
So, there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition. 
 just 
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope, and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. 
 just 
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly. 
well
And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses. 
 just 
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well. 
well
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube, and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower, just on the right species, what happens? 
 just 
Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across. 
 just 
And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves. 
 just 
 Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects. 
okay

Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. 
okay
In fact, they're so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form. 
well
Well, this image you've all seen. 
well
Forty years later, this group, more than most, are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment. 
well
Well, I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, "The Holocaust teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man, when he loses his moral compass and his reason." 
well
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact. 
well
Now, images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion, ignorance, and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image -- In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it. 
 just 
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you, you'll better understand why, and I know that speaking to this audience, you'll definitely do something about it. 
you see
And I really want to build green, but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data, telling me how to do these kinds of things. 
well
Well, now a paper towel looks better. 
well
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room. 
 just 
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors, just pulsing all of these colors. 
 just 
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. 
well
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me, and he had little horns come up above his eyes. 
 just 
So I literally came back from that job, quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing. 
 just 
If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals, especially behavior, it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are, how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors. 
you know
So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could, every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer. 
 just 
So they went on about their business and from a foot away, we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience. 
 just 
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals, you might as well pick one that's fairly common. 
well
But we're just going to zip right past this area, this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary. 
 just 
And you go back, and I'm at home, and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ... 
okay
You think, "Well, what happened?" 
well
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite. 
 just 
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island. 
 just 
Well, how it happened is the local community galvanized. 
well
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming." 
 just 
I always say Harlem is an interesting community because, unlike many other places, it thinks of itself in the past, present and the future simultaneously; no one speaks of it just in the now. 
 just 
Their works for me are about, not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine, that their visions create and put out there in the world, but more, perhaps, importantly, through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation, as well as in the future. 
well
I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be. 
by the way
I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work. 
by the way
I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works, the discovery of exciting works. 
 just 
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp; that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect. 
 just 
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects, earthworms, fungi -- but in general, on land, it's really rare. 
well
I first developed this technique working from a little single-person submersible called Deep Rover and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link, which you see here. 
you see
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence, that's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras. 
 just 
Well, that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois, asked about this bioluminescent clam. 
well
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten. 
well
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini. 
 just 
This is a Christmas tree of a fish; everything on this fish lights up, it's not just that lure. 
 just 
 Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib. 
well
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud. 
 just 
But to me, what's shocking is not just the amount of light, but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase. 
 just 
And I thought, "You know, that might actually make a pretty good lure." 
you know
And scientists have done this on land for years; we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color. 
 just 
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave me time with their ROV so that I could test it and we could figure out, you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us -- get the electronic jellyfish working. 
you know
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was, because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used, the word Ziploc is still visible. 
 just 
It's a beard trimmer, you see? 
you see
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience. 
well
I'll explain that in just a moment. 
 just 
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead. 
 just 
But these people, they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- "Hi, there" -- but they can hear the dead as well, and they can relay this information back to the living. 
well
And what does he do? He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased, the people he's talking to through his ear, you see? 
you see
Isn't it just a lot of fun?" 
 just 
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say, I just paid a lot of money for that reading. 
 just 
Sylvia Browne -- thank you -- Sylvia Browne is the big operator Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you -- for a 20 minute reading over the telephone, she doesn't even go there in person, and you have to wait up to two years because she's booked ahead that amount of time. 
 just 
He's well educated, he's smart, he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn. 
well
He just doesn't care. 
 just 
You see these folks on television -- they never call anybody back from hell.  Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell. 
you see
If they call back any of my friends, they're not going to... Well, you see the story. 
well
Well, pretty well anyway. 
well
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. 
 just 
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay. 
okay
It's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro's limit. 
well
Diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left.  Now folks, this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true. 
 just 
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy. 
 just 
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so. 
well
You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone -- that's more than lawyers make! 
you know
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money. 
i mean
These people don't need the million dollars perhaps, but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it just to make me look silly? 
 just 
These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well, but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate their own so-called powers. 
well
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS. 
well
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. 
well
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost. 
well
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone, "Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it." 
well
So, here you go.  Paragraph number two: You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind. 
 just 
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter. 
by the way
And my father, in a low voice, muttering, "I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do. 
 just 
Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia know all too well. 
well
Many have struggled to come out to their communities, in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick, just queer. 
 just 
They stood for weeks -- first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women -- wearing white, singing, dancing, saying they were out for peace. 
 just 
And the next thing you know, the police have disappeared. 
you know
Leymah said to me later, "It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa. 
you know
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea, whose effects we've only just begun to see. 
 just 
Well, I have to admit, actually, that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica: I wanted to use it myself, a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope 400 years ago. 
well
Well, we can do a little experiment. 
well
Let's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out. 
 just 
Let's just run all possible programs of the particular type that we're looking at. 
 just 
We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here, but we're getting all this amazing stuff. 
 just 
You know, it's always seemed like a big mystery: how nature, seemingly so effortlessly, manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex. 
you know
Well, I think we've found its secret: It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule 30 or like this. 
well
I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things, but something like this is fundamentally irreducible. 
i mean
The only way to find its outcome is, effectively, just to watch it evolve. 
 just 
It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation; just something that happens, naturally, all over the place. 
 just 
Well, this has deep implications about the limits of science, about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies, about intelligence in the universe, about questions like free will and about creating technology. 
well
You know, in working on this science for many years, I kept wondering, "What will be its first killer app?" 
you know
Well, ever since I was a kid, I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable. 
well
Well, then I got to thinking: This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different -- and, by the way, I've now got huge computation capabilities in Mathematica, and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources to do large, seemingly crazy, projects -- So I decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we could make computable. 
well
But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well. 
well
Very good. Okay. 
okay
 The idea is that we can just type this in, this kind of question in, however we think of it. 
 just 
you know, we have an LDL level of 140 for a male aged 50. 
you know
And what's happening here is that Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something; it's computing, in real time, where the International Space Station is right now at this moment, how fast it's going, and so on. 
 just 
But that's just the beginning. 
 just 
Well, even starting from Mathematica, this is still a huge amount of work. 
well
Well, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language, which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them. 
well
And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible. 
 just 
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident. 
i mean
You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing, in which one's starting not just from raw computation, but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge. 
you know
You know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now. 
you know
On the one hand, we have Mathematica, with its sort of precise, formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines. 
 just 
Here we'll just create, in this line, a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there. 
 just 
You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about. 
 just 
So, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with. 
 just 
This is just an example of one of these computable documents. 
 just 
Okay. Let's zoom out again. 
okay
Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe. 
well
Well, the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated. 
well
Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network. 
well
Stephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true, things like the standard model of physics: what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it's simply wrong. 
well
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards.  And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean, I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard, and I hope that it remains that way. 
well
But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years, until I reached my mid-30s and I thought, "You know, I'm not getting any younger. 
you know
To try and answer that question of, "What am I supposed to be doing with my life?" 
i suppose
If I carry on living as I am now, I'm just not going to end up where I want to be in five years, or 10 years, or at the end of my life." 
 just 
So I just had to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these oars so that I could carry on. 
 just 
And the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways I went beyond what I thought were my limits. 
 just 
There were so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit, but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy. 
 just 
And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering, I just felt like a movie star. 
 just 
I suppose what you mean is: What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping? 
i suppose
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping. 
well
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge. 
well
Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific. 
well
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big, but the Pacific is really, really big. 
well
You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there. 
 just 
The first attempt didn't go so well. 
well
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean, which is what happened to it. 
well
It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it, and then we come along and eat that poor critter, and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well. 
well
And that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the waves; if the places where I'd been born and gone to school and got married, if all those places were just going to disappear forever. 
 just 
I even met one of them and she was just about my size. 
 just 
But what about if we just change that story? 
 just 
We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference. 
 just 
And when we do that, we're not just one person. 
 just 
That's just one example. 
 just 
I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me. 
 just 
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist. 
i suppose
We just want to try and create that awareness because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world, but that attitude, that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug, that is what could change the world. 
 just 
All of you know about the topic that I'm supposed to talk about. 
you know
That is, you know what simplicity is, you know what complexity is. 
you know
And let me just read it, the important details here: "Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography']; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it. 
 just 
Well, it enables you to drink coffee. 
well
But also, by the way, the coffee is hot, the liquid is sterile; you're not likely to get cholera that way. 
by the way
And the two here are just examples. 
 just 
Suppose you see a teapot, and the teapot is filled with hot water. 
you see
And it's like the traffic that you see. 
you see
But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things, and you put them together, what can you say about this combination? 
you know
And the answer is, simply, that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily, but if I hold up this, it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven. 
 just 
So that's the next layer of simplicity, and, in fact, integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they, in general, work really well. 
well
Now, one of the nice characteristics is you know what it's going to do, in general. 
you know
You can build cathedrals out of stones, you just have to know what it does. 
 just 
It just is not possible. 
 just 
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details, but in the lower right-hand corner, you see an example of the kind of thing that we have. 
you see
You know, no power required. 
you know
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away." 
you know
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side, but in terms of the system itself? 
i mean
GW: Well, no. 
well
CA: So, in terms of that diagnostic technology that you've got, where is that, and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale. 
you see
GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work, and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind, but the basic technology works. 
i mean
CA: All right. Well, thank you so much for your talk. Thank you.  
well
 And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news -- to fake intellectual capacity. 
okay
If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc." 
 just 
Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props. 
okay
And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well, but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity. 
well
Well, here is a thought experiment for you. 
well
That we know how to eradicate poverty, we just need to do more? 
 just 
Okay, fine. How do you know what would have happened without the aid? 
you know
How do you know? 
you know
How do you know? 
you know
Well, when I started working there, about one percent of children were fully immunized. 
well
Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand. 
well
After all, in this country as well, all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization. 
well
But maybe there is another problem as well. 
well
Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier. 
well
Well, beforehand, everything is the same. 
well
Afterwards, the camp -- just having the camp -- increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent. 
 just 
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable. 
well
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics, because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them. 
well
We can just run an experiment. 
 just 
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results, so I'm just going to talk to you about one. 
 just 
Well, what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets, the coverage rate really falls down a lot. 
well
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets, will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it. 
well
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets." 
you know
Well, at some level, we think all of these things should work. 
well
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it. 
well
Well, if that had been the case, there would have been no Industrial Revolution. 
well
Well, with experiments, what you can do is answer a simple question. 
well
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents, just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money. 
well
And the response of the world was great: Two billion dollars got pledged just last month, so that's about 10,000 dollars per death. 
 just 
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars for every child under five who dies, that would be 90 billion per year just for that problem. 
 just 
Well, I think what part of the problem is that, in Haiti, although the problem is huge, somehow we understand it, it's localized. 
well
But look what we just did today. 
 just 
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet, but we can get started. 
 just 
And yet, they're just a computer company. 
 just 
They're just like everyone else. 
 just 
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose? 
i mean
We just happen to make great computers. 
 just 
I just reversed the order of the information. 
 just 
As I said before, Apple's just a computer company. 
 just 
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one. 
well
It just doesn't drive behavior. 
 just 
Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right." 
 just 
The best we can muster up is, "I don't know. It just doesn't feel right." 
 just 
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. 
 just 
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe. 
 just 
I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. 
you know
He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day. 
well
The others just worked for the paycheck. 
 just 
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, if you don't know the law, you know the terminology. 
you know
Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers. 
well
We all have about 10% who just "get it." 
 just 
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it." 
 just 
So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" -- because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. 
you see
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. 
 just 
And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves. 
by the way
They were extremely well-funded. 
well
I mean, we use TiVo as verb. 
i mean
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product, they told us all what they had. 
you see
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. 
well
And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world. 
 just 
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. 
 just 
By the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech, not the "I have a plan" speech. 
by the way
I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet. 
i mean
And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed, and we thought, "Well, we're real smart. 
well
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there, and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse. 
well
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from, but it's still cheap, and everybody thinks it's okay. 
okay
Well, that's what it's like now, but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock. 
well
It's not just the fish, though, that are disappearing. 
 just 
You can see the rows in the bottom, the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. 
 just 
And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution: one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients. 
 just 
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop, what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea. 
well
And in the process they use up all the oxygen, and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal So, what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish, as you see on the left in front of you. 
you see
That picture on the left is just staggering to me. 
 just 
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore. 
you see
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea. 
i guess
Well, the Northwest Passage is already there. 
well
To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. 
you see
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, "Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died." 
by the way
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. 
well
I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it. 
i mean
Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc. 
well
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey, which led me to come to this point. 
 just 
Is it that I write very well? 
well
Is it that I articulate very well? 
well
Is it that I analyze the data very well? 
well
You know, the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor, and, therefore I think it's okay." 
you know
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand, because this man knows how insensitive our government is. 
you know
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes; you know what the action is? The action is: The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside. 
you know
This is not what our parliament would do. You know, we have a program for employment: One hundred, 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country. 
you know
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee. 
well
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees. 
 just 
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is? 
you know
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.  You know? But here in this clay hot plate, it will never go into your stomach. 
you know
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science. 
you know
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things. 
 just 
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives. 
 just 
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate? 
i mean
On the far left, you see the purple line. 
you see
Well, what might be causing this clustering? 
well
There can be many mechanisms for this effect: One possibility is that your friends say to you something like -- you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you -- like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer," which is a terrible combination.  But you adopt that combination, and then you start gaining weight like them. 
you know
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening just in this 30-year period that includes the obesity epidemic. 
 just 
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness. 
you know
But we don't just experience them, we show them. 
 just 
So, for example, I was giving this talk recently in New York City, and I said, "You know when you're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you, and you just instinctively smile back?" 
you know
The question that we wanted to ask was: Could emotion spread, in a more sustained way than riots, across time not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car? 
 just 
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence, not just an individual existence. 
 just 
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks, their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place, and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure. 
well
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you: if a deadly germ was spreading through the network? 
 just 
Whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes, but with yours. 
 just 
And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are -- and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other. 
you know
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value. 
well
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks, and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks, not just in the individuals within them. 
 just 
And so it is not just what's happening to these people -- whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor, or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us; it's also the actual architecture of the ties around us. 
 just 
Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. 
 just 
I think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena -- like crime, and warfare, and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption. 
 just 
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters; it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated. 
 just 
And we thought, well, that's not really good enough. 
well
Well, there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. 
well
The other thing is, you know, it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood. 
you know
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria. 
you see
Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier. 
okay
This is one of those things you just can't make up. 
 just 
So we thought, "Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium, the parasite involved. 
well
Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics." 
well
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment, and let's think of what could happen if we could do that. 
 just 
Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics. 
well
Nathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer, and here it is. 
okay
 Now, after thinking about this a little bit we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser. 
you know
And we're going to show you, instead of the kill laser, which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse, we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time; otherwise, you can't see it very well. 
well
 We'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one. 
 just 
I mean, here we're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down. 
i mean
But then, if we shift the dial 200, 500 years back, then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous, forming spectacular structures, and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing, where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive. 
you see
Well, what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino, year '97, '98, the water was too warm for too long, and many corals bleached and many died. 
well
But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed. 
you see
Well, there are several ways. 
well
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change -- 4.5 times greater biomass on average, just after five to seven years. 
 just 
You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up. 
you see
Now, if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut, if we brought just 20 divers one month per year, the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time. 
 just 
Well, there are two ways of getting there. 
well
So the solutions are just fixing these three issues. 
 just 
ES: Well, imagine that you have two gears of a watch, a big one and a small one. 
well
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism; and, basically, they just maintain their biomass. 
 just 
is just -- we have to change that completely. 
 just 
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. 
okay
A lot of the experience of people here who've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse, depressing. 
 just 
And if it were not for these places that show hope, It would be just too depressing. 
 just 
I'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way. 
well
When it comes time to do the actual problem set, we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit. 
 just 
You could literally, I mean this, pass this particular unit without knowing any physics, just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. 
 just 
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer, but we're paving a smooth, straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way. 
well
And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line. 
 just 
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A, B, C and D labels to talk about them more easily. 
 just 
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important, and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here, we just give problems to students; we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem. 
 just 
Students need to decide, "All right, well, does the height matter? Does the side of it matter? 
well
 That's how you know you've baited the hook, right? 
you know
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie. 
 just 
These are the kids who now, one semester in, I can put something on the board, totally new, totally foreign, and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year, which is just so fun. 
 just 
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia, because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation; to let students build the problem, because Einstein said so; and to finally, in total, just be less helpful, 
 just 
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better," which, wow. 
by the way
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom, but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later, which is just bizarre, right? 
 just 
And from all of this, I can only conclude that people, not just students, are really hungry for this. 
 just 
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much. 
you know
So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient, you know, that you need from the mom and dad frog."  And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?" 
you know
And I thought, "Okay, here we go." 
okay
And she said, "And where do, um, where do human women, like, where do women lay their eggs?" 
 um
And I said, "Well, funny you should ask.  We have evolved to have our own pond. 
well
And I said, "Well, Men, through their penis, they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out. 
well
And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops, and she goes, "Mom! 
 just 
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on. 
well
And she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again." 
well
Mom, does the man just say, 'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"  And I said, "Yes." 
 just 
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes, "Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street, like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?" 
 just 
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party, and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys, and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom? 
 just 
And she goes, "But I just can't understand it." 
 just 
And we watched them and I'm so thankful, because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing." 
 just 
So we put in dogs mating, and, you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed. 
you know
Well, the human body is literally packed with them -- 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult. 
well
There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline, and we need to grow more blood vessels, just to get back to normal levels -- for example, after an injury -- and the body can do that too, but only to that normal level, that set point. 
 just 
So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food, as well as an antiangiogenic cream, that could be applied on the surface of the tumor. 
well
It had already spread to his lymph nodes, so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip, and the oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside. 
well
And in fact, the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs, are already becoming available. 
well
But the real question is: How well do these work in practice? 
well
This could help healthy people, as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice, and want to find a way to keep it from coming back. 
well
 Well, the answer is yes, and I'm going to show you how. 
well
And we want to measure this because, well, while you're eating a strawberry or drinking tea, why not select the one that's most potent for preventing cancer? 
well
Well, the best example I know is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years, in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week, had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer. 
well
Now, finally, I've talked to you about food, and I've talked to you about cancer, so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about, and that's obesity. 
 just 
WL: Well, you know, there's abundant epidemiological evidence, and I think in the information age, it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed, the National Library of Medicine, to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications. 
well
JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much. 
well
It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. 
 just 
It's structured, so it ends up being simple to remember, and it's okay to break it here and there. 
okay
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina, let me just say, that I had never camped before. 
 just 
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it. 
i mean
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed. 
well
When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census, we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands. 
 just 
And I want to just show you a little bit about why. 
 just 
And so you can see this current coming up -- in this case, the Humboldt Current -- that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands, and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current, that upwells around the Galapagos. 
well
When we have extreme El Nino events, you see all this red, and you see no green out here around the Galapagos. 
you see
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now, at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here. 
you see
So they were just minding their own business. 
 just 
I'm just going to talk about two things. 
 just 
And what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins' positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests. 
you see
Here you see in 2003 -- these are all the dots of where the penguins are -- they were raising a little over a half of a chick. 
you see
The same thing's true for penguins as well. 
well
And I just wanted to show you when Turbo brought in a friend. 
 just 
and you see, Turbo's pretty intent on his flipper patting. 
you see
So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats. 
 just 
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is. 
you know
Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in. 
okay
They're all coming in at this time, walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in. 
 just 
Most important thing is: Only you can change yourself, and only you can change the world and make it better, for people as well as penguins. 
well
Now, that's just one story about oil, and we could end it there and say, "Well, oil's going to last forever because, well, there's just a lot of it." 
well
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil, 1000 meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world. 
by the way
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it. 
 just 
And so, 25 years ago, there was a peak oil; just like, in the 1920s, there was a peak coal; and a hundred years before that, there was a peak wood. 
 just 
Well, a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear, for starters. 
well
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas, and beyond that, peak renewables. 
well
Now that might be the end of the story -- Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that. 
 just 
Well, we have to take a little excursion, and we'll start in central Texas. 
well
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it. 
 just 
Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing, it's calcium carbonate. 
 just 
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell, the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials, until maybe now when it might just matter. 
 just 
So, when we think about the future of energy, imagine what would it be like if instead of this, we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently. 
 just 
It's because, well, thousands of years ago, people invented ideas -- they had ideas, innovations, technology -- and the Stone Age ended, not because we ran out of stones. 
well
It's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions, because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. 
 just 
We narrowed it down to one fragment; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. 
 just 
So, we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome, leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell, when it would have been just a contaminant. 
 just 
And the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500,000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code, but it was using just amino acid single letter translations, which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. 
 just 
And we added three quotations, because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work. 
 just 
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done -- asking for ethical review, pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community, in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government. 
well
Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking. 
 just 
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it. 
i suppose
So, as I was saying --  You see, he's right. 
you see
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously, and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more. 
i mean
And you may say, by the way, "Look, I'm good. 
by the way
 Well, I do. 
well
They say, "But this is me, you know. 
you know
You have to go looking for them, they're not just lying around on the surface. 
 just 
 We suppress it. You know, this is our policy. 
you know
You know what it means? 
you know
It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted. 
by the way
I don't mean they can't, they just often choose not to. 
 just 
And by the way, you don't need either; it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it. 
 just 
But, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education. 
you see
But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative. 
you know
"Well, when did you decide?" He said, "As a kid. 
well
You know, I was thinking about that guy recently, just a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher, because six months ago, I saved his life." 
you know
 He said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR, and I saved his wife's life as well." 
well
  You know, to me, human communities depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability. 
you know
When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said, "College begins in kindergarten." 
well
But as we just heard in this last session, there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three. 
 just 
It just wouldn't work. 
 just 
My wife's just finished writing a novel, and I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours on end. 
 just 
You know this, if you're doing something you love, an hour feels like five minutes. 
you know
And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children. 
 just 
And I wanted to just very quickly -- I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night, recovering old poems. 
 just 
Now, the academics in this audience may think, "Well, that sounds like plagiarism." 
well
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal. 
well
That's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products. 
you see
 Well, yeah. 
well
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion? 
i mean
Maybe just a little. 
 just 
Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another. 
well
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago. 
well
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci, in case you didn't know. 
 just 
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design, at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials. 
you know
Okay, we'll move on.  This is not unlike the world of comedy. 
okay
I don't know if you know that jokes also can't be copyright protected. 
you know
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere, because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend. 
 just 
You know, it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection. 
you know
But you know what? It's revolutionary, and it's a model that a lot of other industries -- like the ones we just saw with the really small bars -- they might have to think about this. 
you know
Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out. 
 just 
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay. 
okay
Most of us worry about things we can't control, like war, terrorism, the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti. 
 just 
Now, you might think of flu as just a really bad cold, but it can be a death sentence. 
 just 
You know, the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically, it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic. 
you know
Well, we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared, but this threat could reappear at any time. 
well
Well, here's the dirty little secret. 
well
This worked well for most pathogens, somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu, but not at all for HIV, for which humans have no natural immunity. 
well
The antibodies you just saw in this video, in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work. 
 just 
And so, in a sense, our luck is holding out, but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime. 
you know
Now realize that in a recently infected person, there are millions of these ships; each one is just slightly different. 
 just 
It's called retro-vaccinology, and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV. 
 just 
But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases. 
you know
So for instance, a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza, as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus. 
well
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design. 
 just 
Well, we first figured out how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them, in the early 1940s. 
well
Viruses only grow in living things, and so it turned out that, for flu, chicken eggs worked really well. 
well
The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow. 
well
Well, with the new technologies emerging now, I hope we can say definitively, "Yes." 
well
Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly -- it's like making yogurt -- and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks, with no eggs, for a fraction of the cost of current methods. 
you know
And, aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example, the E. coli method I just talked about -- look at the time saved: this would be lives saved. 
 just 
In your mind, Seth -- I mean, you must dream about this -- what is the kind of time scale on, let's start with HIV, for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable? 
i mean
SB: The game change can come at any time, because the problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans; we just need a better one. 
 just 
SB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years, but it's been 10 years every 10 years. 
you know
SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. 
 just 
And indeed, this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here. 
 just 
 Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here. 
 just 
  All right. Okay, so ... perfect. 
okay
 Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right. 
okay
Okay. 
okay
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go. 
okay
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished. 
okay
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point. 
okay
Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church. 
you know
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point. 
you know
They go to church, by which I mean, they do lots of things for free for each other. 
i mean
They understand, in that context, "free." They understand "free" is an important cultural ecology as well. 
well
Okay, so Julian made this video. 
okay
And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well. 
well
But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. 
 just 
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here, remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement; it becomes an act of social creativity. 
 just 
And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end, it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. 
 just 
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity; it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities -- social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. 
 just 
Okay, for a second example, think about this cultural hero, icon on the Left, creator of this character. 
okay
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use. 
well
Well, as you all know, not many of us believe we do. 
well
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week. 
 just 
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election, who was the number one, active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech? 
well
It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines. 
 just 
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well. 
well
This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well. 
well
It projects down digital shadows, as you see here. 
you see
But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell, one of the world's legendary production designers. 
well
And that's all well and good. 
well
And, of course, it's not just about navigation, but about manipulation as well. 
well
Let's just come down a bit and fly around. 
 just 
Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore. 
well
And let's just pick out a few elements. 
 just 
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well. 
well
And we probably need, well, we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest. 
well
 You see, cowboys and French farce people don't go well together, and the system knows that. 
well
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency. 
well
 Chris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question -- actually this is from Bill Gates -- when?  CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage? 
 just 
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers? 
 just 
I mean it's been 25 years. 
i mean
You know, how can it work? 
you know
CA: Well that's cool. 
well
I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child. 
i guess
But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well, things that I don't think most people realize. 
well
The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide. 
 just 
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture, there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically. 
well
This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice, and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase. 
 um
You know, I think people go into a restaurant, and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from, and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is, but when they're eating bluefin sushi, do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming? 
you know
And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this, are stacked up like cordwood, just warehouse after warehouse. 
 just 
As I wandered around and made these pictures, it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know. 
you know
And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp. 
 just 
But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well. 
well
And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death, you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays, flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before, were on the bottom of the ocean, alive, but now being thrown back as trash. 
you know
But before I went out to photograph this component, I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark. 
you know
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net. 
 just 
So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days, but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy, largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. 
well
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind. 
 just 
And with this photograph of a beautiful 15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess, female tiger shark, I sort of think I got to that goal, where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose, and my strobe created a shadow on her face. 
i guess
You know, we know almost nothing about them. 
you know
You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. 
you know
You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here, so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess. 
i guess
But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water. 
you know
But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate, and the species' future is in great danger. 
you know
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet and one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot, 70-ton whales, like a city bus just swimming up, you know. 
you know
You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in 1620, wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales. 
you know
For example, these fish predate on sea urchins, and when the fish were all gone, all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins. 
 just 
You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us. 
you know
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well, in beautiful, fragile, protected areas like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found. 
well
And I wanted to finish with this photograph, a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me. 
 just 
That format of forum, at that time, was not well-known outside of Japan. 
well
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats -- just silly pictures of cats with text. 
 just 
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago, and that was the Time 100 poll. 
 just 
And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad. 
you know
And, you know, this didn't sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. 
well
So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here -- the Internet detectives came out. 
i mean
 about a community like 4chan is just that it's this open place. 
 just 
We're moving towards, you know, a lack of privacy, really. 
you know
CA: Well, you never know. Some of them -- we've got people in 75 countries out there watching. 
well
But seriously, this issue on anonymity is -- I mean, you made the case there. 
i mean
And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. 
 just 
I mean, for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment, there is plenty of bad. 
i mean
But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places, now, where you can go and not have identity, to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like. 
 just 
CA: But words, saying things, you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging. 
you know
And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you, I mean, surely there are huge risks with that. 
i mean
But -- CA: Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board what you might say at TED, right? 
i mean
 99 percent of it is just, would have been, you know, bleeped out. 
you know
CA: Okay, well. 
well
Chris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue. 
i mean
CP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one, I guess. 
i guess
I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it, just in terms of language alone. 
 just 
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year. 
you see
That percentage, by the way, is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France. 
by the way
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say, it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit. 
by the way
Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture. 
well
So it made a very low pass, just a few hundred kilometers above the surface. 
 just 
Is there any other use to exploration and science, other than just a sense of wonder? 
 just 
Well, there is. 
well
Because, for the first time, we saw our world, not as a solid, immovable, kind of indestructible place, but as a very small, fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space. 
 just 
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this, it cost a lot, didn't it? 
i mean
Well, actually, many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness, the economic impact of Apollo. 
well
Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing. 
well
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light, it just emits light at particular colors, a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones. 
 just 
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable. 
 just 
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element. 
 just 
And one of the astonishing predictions just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. 
 just 
Well, this is a picture of it. 
well
It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. 
 just 
This is a beautiful quote that I found -- we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming: "When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic." 
 just 
But it's a famous picture, not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings, but actually because of a tiny, faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings. 
 just 
And if I blow it up there, you see it. 
you see
And I'd like to read you what Sagan wrote about it, just to finish, because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken. 
 just 
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of, every human being who ever was lived out their lives. 
you know
Just exploit it; just build things." 
 just 
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with. 
 ok 
Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera. 
 just 
And we came up with some parameters, because, you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations, but it also is pretty wide open. 
you know
Okay.  They wanted it to end precisely on time. 
okay
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect. 
okay
  Okay. 
okay
So, just some statistics about what we went through in the process. 
 just 
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times. 
well
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger. 
well
Well, having completed this, we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things. 
well
 You know, we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things. 
you know
So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing. 
you know
 And now to introduce their music video, we have OK Go. 
 ok 
We are OK Go. 
 ok 
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what! 
 just 
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?" 
 ok 
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me. 
i mean
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers? 
you see
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go, and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass." 
 ok 
 ♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫ ♫ And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around ♫ ♫ If there ain't all that much to lug around ♫ ♫ Better run like hell when you hit the ground ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ You can't stop these kids from dancing ♫ ♫ Why would you want to? ♫

you know
Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments, with passions raging on all sides, are big questions of moral philosophy, big questions of justice. 
 just 
 Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough. 
well
You can just call it out. 
 just 
Well, it's a good reason. 
well
He said, that's what flutes are for -- to be played well. 
well
He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing, we have to reason about, and sometimes argue about, the purpose of the thing, or the social activity -- in this case, musical performance. 
 just 
Charley: And I am.   You know, it's interesting. 
you know
What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right, the justice, of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf. 
 just 
MS: Well, I think that it is possible. 
well
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it. 
you see
Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you." 
 just 
 But then, he said, "If you see a leopard, boy, you better run like hell." 
you see
And you know, during war time, there are militaries, armies, that are moving around. 
you know
Because it was wartime, the British .303 rifle was just all over the whole country. 
 just 
Our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction, protected as well. 
well
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there. 
 just 
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people, that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well? 
well
We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands; we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether -- can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West? 
 just 
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education. 
well
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. 
you know
 We were successful in Namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife. 
 just 
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well, a very interesting observation, that actually those strange little signs that actually flash "35" at you, occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown, according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit -- those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras, which come with the actual threat of real punishment. 
well
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay, heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time. 
okay
So unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity, you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay? 
okay
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately, but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four. 
i suppose
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane." 
i mean
I spoke about this before, and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?" 
okay
One of them also being, although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it, if it only serves two floors, it's actually bloody terrifying, okay? 
okay
Because when the door closes and there's nothing for you to do, you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film. 
 just 
 So these questions ... what is happening in the world is the big stuff, actually, is done magnificently well. 
well
Okay, you simply wouldn't. 
okay
But what I'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach. 
 just 
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot. 
you know
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model. 
i mean
Okay, hands down. 
okay
Okay, I'm reading that at about 75 to 25 in favor at the start. 
okay
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is. 
well
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen. 
well
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land. 
okay
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay, a physicist in England, and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things, he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic." 
well
 CA: Okay. Okay. 
okay
So let's start just by looking at the CO2 emissions from the life cycle. 
 just 
And this is just the CO2 from the life cycle. 
 just 
And the average, just for the construction time of these, is 7.1 years on top of any planning times. 
 just 
If you look at the air pollution health effects, this is the number of deaths per year in 2020 just from vehicle exhaust. 
 just 
Well, right now in the United States, 50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution, and vehicles are about 25,000 of those. 
well
If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world, and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity, the additional death rates due to this averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. 
 just 
That, because the footprint, as you can see, is just the pole touching the ground. 
 just 
And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour-by-hour power demand. 
 just 
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases -- a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that," which is kind of finessing it a little bit, I think. 
well
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first, and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. 
well
David Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things. 
 just 
Alex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say, I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan. 
 just 
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff. 
you know
CA: Point well made. Thank you. 
well
 So each of you has really just a couple sentences -- 30 seconds each to sum up. 
 just 
And just now in England they had a cold spell. 
 just 
CA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark. 
okay
Okay. So here's the read on it. 
okay
Okay, Africa. 
okay
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage, just like they do at CBGB's and places like that. 
 just 
 And well, that was an opera experience. 
well
 Okay. 
okay
Well, there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers. 
well
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well. 
well
The effect is just electric. 
 just 
Presumably, this is just for Christian music. 
 just 
So I asked myself: Okay, is this a model for creation, this adaptation that we do? 
okay
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people, birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy, where the foliage is dense, their calls tend to be high-pitched, short and repetitive. 
well
And I thought: Well, if this is a model for creation, if we make music, primarily the form at least, to fit these contexts, and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls, and if we write software to fit existing operating systems, is that how it works? 
well
And I'm saying, well, the passion's still there, but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into, that is instinctively and intuitively created first. 
well
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around. 
 just 
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?" 
well
It's just like this one, completely worthless, in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic magnetic ion attraction," which translates to "pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good, but it does absolutely nothing. 
 just 
In this case, at trespass points, allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay, actually cost lives. 
okay
It is the default option. We just believe. 
 just 
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files," who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do, and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains. 
well
In fact, what Skinner discovered is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this, and he has to press one of these two keys, and he tries to figure out what the pattern is, and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there -- if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern, they will figure out any kind of pattern. 
 just 
Your name is Lucy, okay? 
okay
Is it a dangerous predator, or is it just the wind? 
 just 
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made an error in cognition, made a Type I error, false positive. 
well
But no harm. You just move away. 
 just 
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch. 
 just 
You've just won a Darwin award. 
 just 
This is the only equation in the talk by the way. 
by the way
So the default position is just: Believe all patterns are real -- All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind. 
 just 
For example, what do you see here? 
you see
And what do you see here? 
you see
What do you see here? 
you see
Just shout out anything you see. 
you see
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing. 
well
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field? 
you see
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease, which is related to a decrease in dopamine. 
you know
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere. 
you see
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply labeled as madness. 
 just 
And what pattern do you see here? 
you see
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes. 
you know
And you see the lamp here, I know. 
you see
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is, of course, the dolphins, right? 
you see
You see a dolphin here, and there's a dolphin, and there's a dolphin. 
you see
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus' "impossible crate" illusion in 3D, in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate. 
well
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right. 
okay
Well, why is this happening? 
well
Well, we know exactly where it happens, in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there, in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. 
well
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator? 
 just 
Well, the wind is inanimate; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent. 
well
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day -- like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were. 
well
So we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that. 
 just 
Well, that's a whole other lecture. 
well
You know how we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration? 
you know
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe, you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there. 
 just 
It's just a minute and a half. 
 just 
Kay, now can you see anything?  Pull it so you can't even see down.  Woman: It's completely blind now, right? 
you see
Girl: Okay.  Girl: No. 
okay
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up. 
okay
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay? 
 just 
   Woman: Okay. 
okay
 Girl: Oh my God! 
 oh 
Well, it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. 
well
This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file, plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. 
 just 
We're not just talking about a few videos, we're talking about over 100 years of video every day, between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site. 
 just 
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts, and that looked like the end of the story, but sometime last year, a young couple got married. 
well
I mean, who are these people? 
i mean
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office," which just goes to show, it's truly an ecosystem of culture. 
 just 
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, but sometimes big studios borrowing back. 
 just 
But it's not just about dollars and impressions. 
 just 
Our vision, which works so well in air, all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic. 
well
Well let's look at mothers and calves. 
well
Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around. 
 just 
But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins the dolphins will start whistling, they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group, wait for the boat to go by, and then they'll get back to normal business. 
 just 
Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida, the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes. 
well
The biologists continued to be skeptical of the long-range communication issue well past the '70s, until the end of the Cold War. 
well
Humpbacks, when they develop the ability to sing this song, they're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing, just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described. 
 just 
This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture, just like music for humans would be. 
 just 
They just sang the cool new west coast song. 
 just 
I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls. 
 just 
Now think about it. This is an amazing thing: That in this frequency range where whales communicate, the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise comes from human ships, thousands of human ships, distant, far away, just all aggregating. 
 just 
This is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision. 
 just 
Well, biologists went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say, "Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground. 
well
Another action which was just taken independently by a shipping company itself was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming. 
 just 
So to conclude, I'd just like to point out, you know, the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment. 
you know
Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs, you know, and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot. 
you know
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well. 
well
I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference, and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school. 
 just 
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease? 
you know
So I just figured that out earlier. 
 just 
It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut. 
 just 
Well, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both. 
well
So I was just like, well there's all kinds of coat hangers. 
well
And so I'll just go get them. 
 just 
And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them, so I just did it anyway. 
 just 
And he's like, "Well, we don't need one." 
well
And he said, "Yes, that's my wife's car." And I said, "Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer." 
 just 
He could just deliver them. 
 just 
I asked him what he did with it, and he said he just throws it out. 
 just 
So I would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies. 
 just 
That doesn't make any sense." You just figure out a way to make more money faster. 
 just 
And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice. 
 just 
You just pick them up with both feet. 
 just 
You get the golf balls, and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them. 
 just 
So I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right? 
 just 
You know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin? So what, right? 
you know
Yeah, but you know what? You stuff that down your shorts, when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free, everybody bought them. 
you know
You know we teach our kids and we buy them games, but why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids, that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs? 
you know
And then they don't have a regular check, but they have more opportunities to find more stuff, and they learn the skill of negotiating, and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well. 
well
Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk, even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches. 
 just 
When you see grumpy customer service, point that out to them. 
you see
Say, "By the way, that guy's a crappy employee." 
by the way
 These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else. 
well
But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well? 
well
[... when our view is cluttered with obstacles.] [But turbulence creates opportunities] [for success, achievement, and pushes us ...] [to discover new ways of doing things] [So what opportunities will you go after and why?] [If you're an entrepreneur] [you know that risk isn't the reward.] [No. The rewards are driving innovation ...] [... changing people's lives. Creating jobs.] [Fueling growth.] [And making a better world.] [Entrepreneurs are everywhere.] [They run small businesses that support our economy,] 
you know
[design tools to help you ...] [... stay connected with friends, family and colleagues around the world.] [And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.] [Do you know an entrepreneur?] [Entrepreneurs can be anyone ...] [Even ... you!] [So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted] [Help heal the economy] [Make a difference.] [Take your business to new heights.] [But most importantly,] [remember when you were a kid ...] 
you know
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best." 
 just 
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life. 
 just 
That very human lesson, more than 20 years ago, served me well during the last economic downturn we had. 
well
Well, not exactly, of course not. 
well
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre -- so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company. 
well
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life. 
 just 
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time, what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure. 
 just 
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure, and all we can measure is the tangible in life, we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid. 
 just 
I hate to argue with Einstein, but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued, aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane? 
 just 
Most world leaders didn't take notice, and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics." 
 just 
For the next three dozen years as king, this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including, just recently, taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed, no coup. 
 just 
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it, is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago. 
 just 
Bhutan's created the ultimate export, a new global currency of well-being, and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own GNH. 
well
You may have heard, this last fall Nicolas Sarkozy in France announcing the results of an 18-month study by two Nobel economists, focusing on happiness and wellness in France. 
well
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote, and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here. 
 just 
Let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now, at least in this country. 
 just 
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life, but actually counts what we most value, the things that are intangible. 
 just 
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO. 
i guess
 Okay, in this presentation, I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains You're going to see a lot of imagery, and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about, so I need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other. 
okay
This is a scientific diagram, by the way. 
by the way
But then as well, I was able to just flip them, rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns. 
well
So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves, and this way, working with the art director, I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read. 
 just 
I've been eating cereal for breakfast And for that same amount of time, I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers. 
 just 
And these were created without sketches, just freehand, by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it. 
 just 
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil. 
well
And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up. 
 just 
And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person. 
 just 
There's a longer story to this, but I did get them all done in time, and they were extremely well received. 
well
And I'm just going to read one of them to you. 
 just 
But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self-doubt, and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are, how inspiring and delightful and really, truly the most completely ..." 
 just 
I'm just really, really thrilled with them. 
 just 
I don't have that much else to say, but they turned out really well. 
well
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds, who are thinking these really big-picture, world-changing, life-changing ideas and technologies. 
you know
And you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else, because inspiration is cross-pollinating. 
 just 
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started, and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why, it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous. 
you know
The lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really: that vantage point determines everything that you see. 
you see
Well, so, for this last year, with the help of Cisco who sponsored me, for some balmy reason, to do this, I've been looking somewhere else. 
well
They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education. 
 just 
Well, education is a global religion. 
well
When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull, not push. 
you see
Well, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it. 
well
Well, you create your own teachers. 
well
Well, this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus. 
well
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said, "You know what you should do with this, Madhav? 
you know
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it. 
you know
Well, we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways. 
well
And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation, what kind of different design we need. 
 just 
And as I said, the trouble with this is that, in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work. 
 just 
And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves. 
you see
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school, they're in family and community, what you also need, definitely, is more on the right hand side. 
 just 
The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone, which over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada, has, through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects, attempted to transform not just education in schools, but the entire culture and aspiration of about 10,000 families in Harlem. 
 just 
You can go to places an hour away, less, from this room, just down the road, which need that, which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined. 
 just 
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. 
 just 
And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid, and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy. 
okay
I suppose we are." 
i suppose
And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd, but that's like a couple of levels above furries. 
i mean
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am. 
 just 
So then you really get into it, and you're like, "Well, the Lego people in Denmark, they've got all this software to let you build your own virtually." 
well
Then you notice that if that Lego-provided CAD program isn't enough, there's an entire open-source, third-party, independent Lego CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make, in fact, movies out of Lego, 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube, and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things. 
 just 
Okay. Anyway. 
okay
And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine; I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego. 
i mean
And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture. 
 just 
But just very quickly -- we'll just see if I can do this quick. 
 just 
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine." 
okay
Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared, publicly available data, whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever. 
you see
I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying, "Where, oh where, can I find a picture of a cute cat?" 
 oh 
The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants, but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating. 
 just 
And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation. 
 just 
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia. 
 just 
I think there are any number of reasons, and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few. 
 just 
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S. 
well
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. 
well
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically. 
 just 
I mean, how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices? 
i mean
Suburban expansion to cheap land, for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream. 
you know
I mean, that's 2005 figures. 
i mean
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon. 
you know
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this. 
 just 
When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown, it made sense to just build surface parking lots. 
 just 
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location. 
 just 
It no longer just makes sense. 
 just 
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots. 
 just 
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one. 
well
And they've made this, what was just a store along a commercial strip, into a community gathering space. 
 just 
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots. 
 just 
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental. 
you know
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville. 
 just 
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction. 
 just 
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines. 
well
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city. 
 just 
to just create pockets of walkability. 
 just 
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels. 
i mean
These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta. 
 just 
And just the surface appearance are often -- like the Astroturf here -- they make me wince. 
 just 
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job. 
you know
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know. 
well
And if we just take that and we build from there, then we can go to the next step, which is that if the ocean ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. 
 just 
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell, but you know what they came out saying? 
you know
They say, "You know what you smell? 
you know
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here. 
 just 
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around, and instead of accumulating, they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they're absorbed by us. 
well
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way. 
by the way
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking, "Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery," but it was so awful. 
well
It isn't just there that this happens, but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic, a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women. 
 just 
It's not just a question of cleanliness; it's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease. 
 just 
And if you can see on some surfing sites, in fact, not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like, but on some surf rider sites, you see a little flashing poo alert. 
you see
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms: shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera, diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning. 
 just 
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities, brought there, not by a normal human vector, but by a marine vector, this copepod. 
well
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well, that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged. 
well
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do. 
well
Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard, who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be. 
 just 
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid, and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life. 
well
But what you see here is the result of, actually, internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden. 
you see
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment. 
 just 
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. 
well
And just in closing, I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. 
 just 
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years. 
well
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like, you know, shoes, leather belts, handbags, etc., where no sentient creature is harmed. 
you know
 Well, the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar because it's very old. 
well
It was very much uncontrollable, and in a certain sense, it seemed to be the extreme of complexity, just a mess, a mess and a mess. 
 just 
Well, it's very interesting. 
well
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5." 
well
So the eye, after a while, can distinguish these two very well. 
well
Well, you measure and measure and measure. 
well
Well, surprisingly enough, it's good in many ways. 
well
They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on. 
 just 
If you take this thing, you know very well it weighs very little. 
well
Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough, the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. 
well
Well, 99.9. 
well
Well, they do mix. 
well
Well, I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has, in fact, seen at long last what had been seen for a long time. 
well
Well, a man named Hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke, and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness. 
well
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]." 
 just 
Well actually, I was not silly. 
well
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well. 
well
Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new? 
 just 
Well, so I looked at these things called Brownian motion -- just goes around. 
well
So he painted it, which means he put inside everything. He said: "Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop! 
well
Well actually I started, oddly enough, studying stock market prices. 
well
To the right, on top, you see a theory which is very, very fashionable. 
you see
Well, these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did. 
well
And it went really well 50 years ago. 
well
"Well, acts of God. 
well
If you master these, you master price, and if you don't master these, you can master the little noise as well as you can, but it's not important. 
well
Well, here are the curves for it. 
well
 Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that "discovery" and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying, "But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big." 
well
Well, let me finish. 
well
This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics. 
 just 
It's so simple, and we thought, you know, okay, it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year. 
you know
But of course, you know at the U.N., sometimes things move slowly, and they basically said no. 
you know
So we said screw it, we'll just start our own company, which we did three years ago. 
 just 
We did this bag for Haiti, and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti. 
 just 
I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country. 
i mean
So those seem like two bifurcated problems, but I kind of started to think about, you know, what is obesity and hunger? What are both those things about? 
you know
Well, they're both about food. 
well
Well, agriculture in America's very interesting. 
well
Well, the foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat. 
well
And you know, the reality is that between farmers in America, who actually, quite frankly, when I spend time in the Midwest, are pretty large in general. 
you know
There's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America, and it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis, when, you know, mass consolidation, mass exodus of small farmers in this country. 
you know
And then in the same time period, you know, we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. 
you know
I think, you know, it's not just in our own country, but really we're exporting the system around the world, and when you look at the data of least developed countries -- especially in cities, which are growing really rapidly -- people are eating American processed foods. 
you know
You know, there's 30-year cycles. 
you know
You know, I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years, there's hope in that. 
you know
Well, I really care about 1980 because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. 
well
And you know, these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. 
you know
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple, then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat. 
well
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet. 
you see
And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. 
 just 
And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. 
you know
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have. 
well
Well, I'm going to project into 2050. 
well
I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. 
 just 
Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. 
well
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? 
you see
Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here? 
you see
Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. 
well
It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. 
 just 
We can have a much more just world. 
 just 
Do it well and get used to it. 
well
But what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context, not just about the oil eruption, but what it means and why it has happened. 
 just 
I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid, and because I did, I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. 
 just 
Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. 
 just 
So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization. 
 just 
You see a lot of oil on the ocean. 
you see
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline. 
you see
It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car, and you just dumped it in the ocean. 
 just 
Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic. 
 just 
If you go to the places where it's just arriving, like the eastern part of the Gulf, in Alabama, there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach. 
 just 
You see people who are really shell-shocked. 
you see
Well, some people say there are oil plumes. 
well
And Congressman Markey asks, you know, "Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes?" 
you know
Okay. 
okay
It's not like we're starting with something that's been okay. 
okay
And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. 
 just 
There was nothing ready, and, you know, as we can see by what they're doing. 
you know
And I think, you know, that's a great name to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface. 
you know
So it's just absolutely crazy. 
 just 
You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom. 
 just 
It's just ridiculous. 
 just 
Well, as an ornithologist, I can tell you that birds fly, and that --  and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it; it doesn't do it. 
well
 Not just B.P. 
 just 
It turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States -- you know, if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil, you would be in big trouble. 
you know
And even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them. 
 just 
Okay, people who say they're conservative, if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic, they would tell these corporations to go to hell. 
okay
Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place, but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed. 
 just 
The first offshore wells were called whales. 
well
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. 
 just 
Well, it uses sexual reproduction. 
well
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817. 
well
Well no, because if you think about it, if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes, and then they trade, then they will each have saved an hour of work. 
well
You know, I think it's probably millions. 
you know
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor. 
well
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male. 
 just 
And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa, when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. 
you see
How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration? 
you know
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals, who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa, which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe. 
well
He just knows how to run a company. 
 just 
The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on. 
well
And by the way, that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q., about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. 
by the way
What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas, and how well they're cooperating, not how clever the individuals are. 
well
We're just the nodes in the network. 
 just 
Because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom-up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. 
 just 
And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao," 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird. 
 just 
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine. 
 just 
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one, asking people to be active online, so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase. 
 just 
The other thing you can take from this, by the way, is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter. 
by the way
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected. 
well
but look at this map, and you can watch this for, you know, two or three minutes. 
you know
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention, the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S. 
you see
So this is a real problem -- not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year -- but it's a real problem because, as we're discussing here at TED, the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope, they require global conversations to get to global solutions. 
 just 
What I'm starting to realize is that you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work, and you need an enormous amount of encouragement. 
 just 
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. 
you know
And you can listen to her as well, if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. 
well
He's both a very well known American geek, but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya. 
well
These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced, are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web. 
well
And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing. 
 just 
On the one hand was my mother, a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman. 
well
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know, crack better jokes, say better things, but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. 
you know
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad, physically and spiritually. 
i guess
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it, but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man." 
well
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer, Baldwin stopped and said, "But don't you see? There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else, and nothing in everybody else that is not in me." 
you see
We were three writers, one from the Philippines, one Turkish and one Indonesian -- like a joke, you know. 
you know
It was just a story. 
 just 
Everybody could go and listen, you know -- ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims. 
you know
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place. 
you know
Like that, my fiction as well. 
well
In the palace, just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines, there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. 
 just 
And yet, why is it that, in creative writing courses today, the very first thing we teach students is "write what you know"? 
you know
So I went there in 2007, and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election -- the national election, December 28. 
 just 
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election. 
i mean
 CA: Here's -- We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video. 
 just 
Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up. 
 just 
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals. 
 just 
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene. 
 just 
CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right, including two Reuters employees? 
i mean
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. 
i guess
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables. 
i mean
I mean, did he? 
i mean
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy. 
i mean
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... 
i mean
JA: We would have released them.  JA: Yeah.  JA: Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments. 
well
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy? 
i mean
JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world, what sort of information can achieve reform. 
well
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy. 
i mean
But there are legitimate secrets -- you know, your records with your doctor; that's a legitimate secret -- but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated. 
well
CA: So they are well-motivated. 
well
And what would you say to, for example, the, you know, the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military, and he says, "You know what, you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. 
you know
CA: So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government. 
you see
But do you see any irony in the fact that, in order for you to shine that light, you have to, yourself, create secrecy around your sources? 
you see
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet. 
i mean
CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far -- I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience. 
 just 
You know, there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. 
you know
You know, hero -- people's hero -- bringing this important light. 
you know
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right? 
 just 
So late last year -- in November last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in Albania, like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, but not quite as big. 
well
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. 
 just 
The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it." 
 just 
And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it, wanting to track down the source --  saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source." 
 just 
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment, we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort. 
i mean
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization, we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth, and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information. 
i mean
I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with, so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff, and then lower security cases. 
i mean
 CA: I mean, a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia. 
i mean
  CA: And you were also -- I mean, you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on. 
i mean
JA: Well, I was a journalist. 
well
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. 
you know
I mean there's like -- there's a method that can be deployed for various things. 
i mean
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account, but what about your core values? 
well
But the core values: well, capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims. 
well
JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime. 
you know
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story: what happened in Iceland? 
 just 
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know. 
you know
Well, we just show the website instead, for all that time, as a filler, and we became very famous in Iceland, went to Iceland and spoke about this issue. 
well
And just a month ago, this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. 
 just 
When you think of the future then, do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control, more secrecy, or us watching Big Brother, or it's just all to be played for either way? 
 just 
I mean, there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world -- within the E.U., between China and the United States. 
i mean
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort, we can shift it one way or the other. 
 just 
CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say, Julian, be careful, and all power to you. 
well
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel, get their message from above. 
 just 
  These are clearly biblical archetypes, and the thinking behind that was to create positive, globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message. 
 just 
It doesn't matter what your religion is; even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know, "Make sure you lie three times a day." 
you know
I rewrote that story, and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen -- and here's a side note: if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well. 
well
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay. 
okay
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone, you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers, okay. 
okay
Well ... 
well
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ... 
you know
And I think I scared him --  because he basically promised me -- we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away." 
 just 
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out." 
you know
But the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing, is that we've done a 26-episode animated series, which is done for global audiences: in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know. 
 just 
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero, that just breaks you in so many ways. 
 just 
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately, okay. 
okay
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews, the people around, who were interviewed as well, refer to that behavior as Talibanization. 
well
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house. 
 just 
You know, I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. 
you know
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something. 
you know
And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel, ate it and, you know, talked and left. 
you know
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know. 
you know
 Just today, D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover. 
 just 
On that cover you see Batman, Superman and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The 99, our Emirati member and our Libyan member. 
you see
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky. 
well
Now, the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because, even back then, his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask: if the Earth is just a planet, then what about planets around other stars? 
 just 
The telescope is actually built similarly to the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope, except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens, as you would call it as a photographer. 
well
And as you see on this animation, what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. 
you see
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. 
 just 
Well, let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today. 
well
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay. 
okay
Finally, 15 years ago, the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star, and we actually did pretty well. 
well
But you see, we haven't gone very far. 
you see
Because with our own little telescope, just in the next two years, we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them. 
 just 
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. 
well
Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. 
 just 
From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you, where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth, and we hope to meet in the middle one day. 
 just 
Well, there are many reasons, and you heard some of them in the short talk today. 
well
Okay, let's say this is the size of the observable universe, with all the galaxies, with all the stars, okay, from here to here. 
okay
I mean look, you can see the necktie, but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little, small atom. 
i mean
But that's not the whole story, you see. 
you see
Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea, but this task, as Bruno mentioned, isn't an easy one for two main reasons: First, the detection algorithms. 
well
 So the device that you see is a 14-channel, high-fidelity EEG acquisition system. 
you see
Evan. Okay. 
okay
He just hangs out. He's relaxed. 
 just 
Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull." 
okay
But with "disappear," there's really no analogies -- so Evan, what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay. 
okay
Okay. Let's try that. 
okay
Oh, my goodness. He's just too good. 
 just 
So let me just start with my story. 
 just 
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story, and, by the way, I married a woman who has exactly the same story. 
by the way
So with that, let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. 
 just 
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. 
 just 
First thing for my wife, and the most common thing I hear from my patients, particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group, is they come in and say, "Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee? 
 just 
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left, and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen, and doing well. 
well
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients. 
 just 
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak, just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee, as you see in the other image -- and having a paste graft to that knee. 
you see
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles. 
well
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement, not just the parts? 
 just 
Well here's how we're going to do it. 
well
 Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it, I ordered a cup of coffee, which the waiter brought over promptly. 
well
 In contrast, Asian-American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice, second best when they chose for themselves, and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith. 
well
A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked, "Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said?" 
 just 
For them, choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality, but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected. 
 just 
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. 
 just 
It's all just soda. That's just one choice." 
 just 
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans, not just to a particular flavor of soda, but to a particular brand. 
 just 
You know, research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. 
you know
 For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world, choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is. 
 just 
There are some dilemmas you see. 
you see
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is: How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on? 
i guess
Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices. 
well
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. 
 just 
 And so I asked these two ladies, and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'" "Well, what does it look like?" 
well
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink." 
well
"Okay, great." 
okay
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart? 
well
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous." 
well
Okay, we got that. 
okay
And the only thing they had consensus on: well, if I could see them, I would clearly be able to tell them apart. 
well
But we said, well, on the bright side, our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon. 
well
So then I got really curious, myself, as a toxicologist, and I donated some blood to my lab and said, "Okay, let's do it." 
okay
Well, we detected 113 different compounds in my blood. 
well
And just to point out the levels -- Americans have 10 to 40 times higher levels of these compounds in our bodies than the Europeans. 
 just 
But then I thought, well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite. 
well
And Jackie Savitz spoke this morning about Big Oil and the propaganda and how we're all brainwashed with their, you know, lies and so forth. 
you know
Well, Big Chemical is what we're dealing with here. 
well
And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton, bumping into, you know, little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores, the herring kind of fish. 
you know
And you could just see the web of death as you go down in the water column. 
 just 
Well, you know, we got into this in the beginning as a trade-off, they say, between the wetlands versus the ocean depth. 
well
And as you know, there's been a very weak response, up until recently, to actually collect the oil. 
you know
So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay? 
okay
We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way. 
by the way
And I'm part of a chat group, which is a national group of toxicologists and chemists that are, you know, basically turning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff, and what is it doing and what are the interactions of these chemicals, most of which we don't know, and what are their byproducts, which are usually more toxic than the parent compound. 
you know
So this is what we have to look at, these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets, which have nothing on them much. 
you know
And then part of this is just part of my bad dreams. 
 just 
Corals are, you know, the home to about a quarter of all marine species. 
you know
The plankton and the plankton eaters, you know, these are the little herring fish that go through the water column with their mouths open, feeding indiscriminately and just lapping up this brown pudding of toxic stuff. 
you know
And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks from the Exxon Valdez spill, and they haven't come back. 
you know
And by independent, I do not mean alone; I mean independent in the sense of not tied to the kind of crime-scene secrecy that's going on in the Gulf now. 
i mean
Another is that there are bold, new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. 
well
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
If you can see the complexity, you can see how tiny, little eddies and large eddies and the motion -- this is just sea surface temperature, but it's immensely complicated. 
 just 
So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas, need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well. 
well
Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents, but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor, there is vast reservoir of microbial activity, which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. 
 just 
Well, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that, "The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory, but possibly in having new sets of eyes," new ways of seeing things, a new mindset. 
well
And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here, was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. 
 just 
On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring, which I'll show you in just a second. 
 just 
Climate change, ocean acidification, dissolved oxygen, carbon cycle, coastal upwelling, fishing dynamics -- earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. 
well
And this is just the first of these. 
 just 
Robotics systems are just incredible these days, absolutely incredible. 
 just 
It's smaller than a postage stamp, and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move. 
 just 
Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I, but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years. 
you know
So in the volume of the ocean, we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry, but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis. 
 just 
Grid computing: the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. 
 just 
So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented. 
 just 
And as I go here, I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms, and indeed, what we can bring into your pocket. 
 just 
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. 
you know
But of course, just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude. 
 just 
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. 
 just 
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out? 
you know
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with, the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those, design things better, and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be. 
 just 
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways. 
 just 
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. 
 just 
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant, but albeit evolutionary, relative. 
you know
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well, but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up. 
well
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up. 
you know
First problem is just, well, where should we start? 
well
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans. 
you know
You know, where are we actually going to start with this? 
you know
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff. 
you know
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here. 
you know
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money. 
well
So that's just what we did. 
 just 
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token. 
 just 
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal. 
 just 
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this. 
you see
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. 
 just 
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like. 
 just 
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. 
 just 
Is this a market at all, or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something, looking smart, but not really being smart. 
 just 
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money? 
well
Well, you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other. 
well
And over time, they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn, you know, who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on. 
you know
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools, they basically matched, not just qualitatively, but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market. 
 just 
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might. 
well
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species. 
you know
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other, often from us -- you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing, but things we spontaneously saw. 
you know
One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out, you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years. 
you know
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure. 
 just 
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks. 
 just 
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently. 
well
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty. 
 just 
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level. 
well
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500. 
well
This is all well and good, except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not. 
well
But this is the same choice you guys just faced. 
 just 
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk. 
well
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two. 
 just 
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it. 
well
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
you know
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too. 
you know
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. 
you know
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. 
well
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake. 
you know
You can't just shut that off. 
 just 
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me." 
 just 
We're just built differently. 
 just 
Well, the good news, I think, is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk, which is that humans are not only smart; to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom. 
well
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know, I flew over here in an airplane. 
you know
I remember standing on the edge of the ice, about to dive into the water, and thinking to myself, I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening. 
 just 
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. 
 just 
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. 
 just 
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. 
you know
28 great, big, powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don't just have my Speedo, but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world. 
 just 
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. 
 just 
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time. 
 just 
And my team just gave it to me straight. 
 just 
And I stood there on the edge of the lake, and I looked up at Mt. Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself, just do this slowly. 
 just 
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well, doesn't mean it's going to work in the future. 
well
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is, frankly, the Mt. Everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long, just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long, doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. 
 just 
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?" 
well
So I said, "Well, you've got to make a rainforest ice cream. 
well
He said, "Okay." 
okay
 Okay. Fast forward. 
okay
There's just one of them. 
 just 
It's not just about population, and it's not just about them; it's about us. 
 just 
But it's not just about people; it's about lifestyles. 
 just 
Okay, so let's be generous. 
okay
And in the next 18 months, we will have signed up to work with another 40, and we think we'll get those signed as well. 
well
If you take a look just at water, what we see is that, with four very common products, you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products, and then you look at how much water input was put into them, and then you look at what the farmer was paid. 
 just 
But they're not just buying the juice; they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe. 
 just 
We can't just focus on identifying the best; we've got to move the rest. 
 just 
Look, you all are very well traveled; this is TEDGlobal after all. 
well
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. 
 just 
I can give scholarships to all the girls, you know, if they work hard and stay in school. 
you know
Well, let me ask you this question. 
well
Okay, most of you. 
okay
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong. 
well
And, you know, it happens for several reasons. 
you know
The second tenet of "Half the Sky" is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all, and just on a purely practical level, we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force. 
 just 
And you know, when you educate a boy, his family tends to have fewer kids, but only slightly. 
you know
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket, you would have a transformative effect. 
 just 
Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. 
well
And I'll just say two things about this. 
 just 
You know, childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event. 
you know
You know, it's not as though we don't have the technological solution, but these women have three strikes against them: they are poor, they are rural and they are female. 
you know
You know, for every woman who does die, there are 20 who survive but end up with an injury. 
you know
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby, but you know, her body was very immature, and she ended up having obstructed labor. 
you know
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank, once said that, "It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education." 
well
Well, it just so happens, at that time, there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut. 
well
The cash started accumulating, and pretty soon the parents said, "You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school." 
you know
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school. 
 just 
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. 
you see
You know, the criticism is fair; it isn't easy. 
you know
You know, people say how half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed. 
well
I will just leave you with two things. 
 just 
The first is a Kinect camera, which will be out in November, some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults, in Microsoft, plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead, mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea: to create a real, living being in a computer. 
 just 
Now, I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick, but it's a trick that actually works. 
 just 
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around. 
 just 
We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo, we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat, to be honest with you. 
to be honest
So the problem we introduced to him was this: he's just moved house. 
 just 
You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. 
 just 
By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails; if you're a girl, it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. 
by the way
His face, by the way, is fully AI-driven. 
by the way
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad, why not use your body just to lean on the chair -- again, relaxed? 
 just 
Milo: I could just squish it. 
 just 
When you see the microphone, say ...  ... yes to decide. 
you see
PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. 
okay
Okay, this is skimming stones. 
okay
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done. 
well
Milo: Okay. 
okay
PM: So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor, on the brand-new carpet. 
 just 
He's just moved house. He's got no friends. 
 just 
Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like. 
you know
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to. 
well
Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all. 
 just 
Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo. 
well
And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life, and it goes on, and he has, you know, many adventures. 
you know
I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt used laughter to unite the region, just as football can. 
 just 
Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand-up comedy circuit, where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly. 
well
Let's just say "value for money." 
 just 
I'd say, watch any successful well-written, family-friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. 
well
In five countries, in just under a month, we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live. 
 just 
In Dubai this year, we've just had the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show. 
 just 
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese, Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour, has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs. 
 just 
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians, then I'm not surprised. 
well
Now, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems, as you know. 
you know
So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know, like part of me likes me, part of me hates me. 
you know
Because if you only have the Iranian passport, you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms, you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea. 
you know
Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries, because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either. 
i guess
I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro." 
well
"We just wanted to say we tried." 
 just 
I just did a seven-country solo tour. 
 just 
And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. 
well
And they don't get paid that well. 
well
And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well. 
well
Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here. 
 just 
There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer: they just suck. 
 just 
They're not very well designed, right? 
well
And that's okay, right? A lot of people are very happy with Facebook. 
okay
I mean, we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it, you know, productive down the road. 
you know
And so it's incredibly critical that at this moment, while it's just getting constructed, while the frameworks like Facebook, like the Open Graph, are being created for the game layer equivalent, that we think about it very consciously, and that we do it in a way that is open, that is available, and that can be leveraged for good. 
 just 
And so that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics, because construction has just begun, and the more consciously we can think about this, the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want. 
 just 
So with that, you know, a couple game dynamics to talk about. 
you know
And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes, because you think, you know, other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact: what I do, where I do it, when I do it. 
you know
So I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar, and I saw these happy hour things all over the place, right. 
 just 
This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior, it's influenced our entire culture. 
 just 
It's something that people don't do very well. 
well
And they have these GlowCaps, which, you know, flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine. 
you know
 So they whip it out. And you see men, they have that black card. 
you see
And this is used in games as well. 
well
School -- and remember, I made it through one year, so I think I'm qualified to talk on school -- is a game, it's just not a terribly well-designed game, right. 
well
There are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status? 
i mean
This is used in conventional games as well. 
well
I mean, you see this is a paladin level 10, and that's a paladin level 20, and if you were going to fight, you know, orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul, you'd probably want to be the bigger one, right. 
you know
And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says "Boardwalk." 
 just 
Let's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing. 
well
Then of course, the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003. And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to 3,000 billion. 
 just 
So now it's great because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well. 
well
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. 
well
Well, November, Christmas video games come out, and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content. 
well
Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting, and since then, that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year. 
well
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it? 
well
You see where it starts? September 2001, when we had something very real to be scared about. 
you see
But if you look at it directly, it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts. 
 just 
I just kind of learned through doing. 
 just 
So that might well chime with your view that America is a sort of warmongering military machine, out to overpower the world with its huge industrial-military complex. 
well
Again, chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces. 
you know
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff that affects heart health." 
well
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics, I just want to see plants and -- just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients." 
 just 
New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet. 
 just 
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. 
 just 
So, just to wrap up, I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions, and information design is about solving information problems. 
 just 
It feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment, from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency, or even just interestingness. 
 just 
I mean, I find information just too interesting. 
 just 
What we don't know is the exact, precise, immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns -- winds, ocean currents, precipitation rates, cloud formation, things that bear on the health and well-being of billions of people. 
well
It's just a big blue surface. 
 just 
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. 
 just 
I kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with. 
 just 
He's kind of just out there making a living. 
 just 
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know, it's a real project we've heard about. 
you know
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that. 
well
Plastic just is not going to do it." 
 just 
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride, which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. 
well
What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away; it just continues to wash downstream. 
 just 
This is what I love about comic strips, you know. 
you know
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster. 
you see
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something." 
well
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil, you see some ice cubes, and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm. 
you see
And we don't really understand what oil is, until you check out its molecules, And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn. 
you see
It'll just bake your retinas. 
 just 
It starts of with the very small ones, which are one carbon, four hydrogen -- that's methane -- it just floats off. 
 just 
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics, because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused. 
 just 
But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy, not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. 
i mean
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas, we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. 
well
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. 
i mean
I mean -- and this is funny, it looks funny here. 
i mean
Okay, so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. 
okay
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. 
 just 
 Okay, so that guy is actually still with us. 
okay
 I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA. 
i mean
And we take it as, you know -- we look at it on a moral level, rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level. 
you know
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions -- I'm just saying that, when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards, you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate, or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. 
 just 
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill. 
i mean
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. 
i mean
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S., they might be actually here in this room. 
i mean
We were driving along this dark, dark road, and the guy in the green stepped out, and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it." 
 just 
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out, and we realized it was okay. 
okay
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see, this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil. 
well
It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has, but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary. 
i mean
Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States, half of it is actually being refined along the coast, because the Gulf actually has about 50 percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. 
well
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil, but on the other hand, the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work, generally in a fairly crummy car. 
 just 
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. 
you see
Okay, lots of you. 
okay
Well, you know the story. 
well
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road. 
 just 
He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice, sustainability and people's well-being. 
well
Okay, they think money is slightly important. 
okay
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms, instead of just how much stuff we have? 
 just 
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness, how do we measure well-being, how can we do that within environmental limits. 
well
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use. 
well
It's about the well-being of nations. 
well
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average. 
you see
To the top right of the graph, are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being, but they're using a lot of planet to get there. 
well
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph, are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically, sub-Saharan Africa. 
well
And this is the trend in well-being over that time, a small increase, but this is the trend in ecological footprint. 
well
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being. 
well
You put a smart meter in your home, and you see how much electricity you're using right now, how much it's costing you, your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly. 
you see
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being. 
well
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues. 
well
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life? 
well
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being. 
well
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it. 
you know
Now, this is not only about numbers; this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well. 
well
You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being -- nitrous oxide, methane, deforestation, overfishing land degredation, loss of species -- they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years. 
well
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level. 
you see
Now, as if this was not enough -- to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet -- we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states, separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram, where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. 
 just 
As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources. 
you know
You know, you don't want to stand there. 
you know
And this is the new paradigm, which we gathered two, three years back, recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future, aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past. 
 just 
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space, the quantified boundaries, as suggested by this analysis. 
you see
In the '60s already, through the green revolution of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole. 
you know
Well, there's no science to suggest. 
well
Well, yes, in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer. 
well
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge, which is feeding a world of nine billion people. 
well
Well, interestingly, and based on my work and others in Africa, for example, we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems, with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts, sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields, and innovations in tillage systems, we can triple, quadruple, yield levels on current land. 
well
TD: So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. 
 just 
Along with outward development and increase of opportunity, there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections. 
well
TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas, which, as you know, were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan. 
you know
TD: So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well-being, or deep sense of well-being as humans, and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now. 
well
TD: So, every one of you who has come here is so talented, and you have so much to offer to the world, I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good 
 just 
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? 
okay
Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. 
well
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. 
well
But if you do need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction, such as, "I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't, okay?" 
okay
 Exactly! Well done.   
well
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. 
 just 
It's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus" because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well. 
well
So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus, and what it's doing -- it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients. 
you see
So this strategy has served it pretty well -- it's 2,400 years old. 
well
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet, and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen. 
 just 
 This is a clonal tree as well. 
well
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree, and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change. 
you see
This is the Fortingall Yew -- no, I'm just kidding -- this is the Fortingall Yew. 
 just 
And you know, I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. 
you know
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think, because it is just so unusual. 
 just 
I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from, and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia, you see that there are a number of petrified forests, and the logs are all -- the logs are all giant coniferous trees, and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from. 
you see
It's bushfelt region, which is dry and prone to a lot of fires, as so what these trees have done is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree, and that this is ground level, imagine that the whole thing, that whole bulk of the tree, migrated underground, and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. 
 just 
If you've been in the American West, you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous, but that being said, you see that this has this unique, circular form. 
you know
It also has a friend nearby -- well, I think they're friends. 
well
So, now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. 
well
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things, so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world. 
you see
They've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments, but now some of them are in jeopardy, and they can't just get up and get out of the way. 
 just 
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there. 
well
So we have an ironic problem -- good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. 
 just 
So when they spoke into it, the computer typed out gibberish, so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying." 
well
 Boy: ... just mention, I play games like animals, and I listen to music. 
 just 
They would, you know, throw it back at you. 
you know
I mean, if there's stuff on Google, why would you need to stuff it into your head? 
i mean
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?" 
well
So I said, "Well, how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing?" 
well
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. 
 just 
Well, one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. 
well
I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. 
well
And I explained to them that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method. 
you know
I said, "Well, let's try it. 
well
Well, you know, they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers. 
well
Teacher: Well done. Very good ... 
well
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about. 
you know
I said, "Well, do it." 
well
  SM: So you know what's happened? 
you know
I think we've just stumbled across a self-organizing system. 
 just 
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown and ask help," and started getting help from everywhere, each and every corner of my life at that time. 
i guess
And one of those competitions, I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio. 
 just 
So I just switched on in the train, loudly. 
 just 
If you travel in Indian trains, you can see people listening to radio and, you know, even from their mobiles. 
you know
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here. 
 just 
You know, like just adjacent to me. 
you know
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?" 
 just 
You just quit school and come there." 
 just 
So, why I'm telling you this, you know, maybe, you know, whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible. 
you know
So that's what made me enter [the] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work, or art and finally I'm here in front of you. 
 just 
When I look back, you know, on what happened between that time and now here -- the last 10/15 years -- I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects, but it was not intentional. 
you know
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking, "What really makes us?" -- you know, it's actually [the] past, what makes a person. 
you know
But it is just a kind of trace of that time. 
 just 
It's just a trace of being in this body. 
 just 
So here, what happened then, you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself. 
you know
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because, knowingly or unknowingly, whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here. 
you know
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture thumbprint, footprint, or whatever traces we leave as humans." 
 just 
Because when I was capturing traces, you know, this thought comes to me always: is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace, or is there other ways to capture it?" 
you know
So this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens, it just shows what is on the other side. 
 just 
So I just put the paper on the focal length, which was an etching print, then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight. 
 just 
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope, and just burnt it. 
 just 
Then move towards questioning the perception because, even though there are traces, when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role. 
you know
Can you just raise the hand? 
 just 
If you just ask an opinion of how, everyone can interpret it. 
 just 
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know. 
you know
 So, what we see is just what we think often, and most of the time, we don't see what it is. 
 just 
It just all depends on one's perception. 
 just 
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper. 
you know
It's just created by the mind. 
 just 
It's just that being a human, the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning. 
 just 
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark." 
you know
It's just captured through from the lamp. 
 just 
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness. 
 just 
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that. 
 just 
It's about six inches deep in the wall, but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall. 
 just 
You know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin, and this is the second, and there's a third, and each creates a meaning. 
you know
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery. 
 just 
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators -- and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception -- whenever I see the bird flying in the sky, it just makes me feel like: is there anything behind, are there any traces up there, which as a human, we don't see them? 
you know
Finally, I went back to them and said, "It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work. 
 just 
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions. 
 just 
This is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other. 
 just 
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time. 
you know
So, I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there. 
 just 
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this, you know? 
you know
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that. 
okay
So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow. 
you see
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall. 
 just 
So my request was like, is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign? 
 just 
And to really get to the point, we should move beyond, you know, go to the other side of the wall, like illogic, like are invisible. 
you know
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it, you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints, and the footprints are nothing but passing time. 
 just 
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. 
i mean
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know, where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy, and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken." 
you know
I felt just something's broken. 
 just 
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York. 
 just 
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?" 
you see
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. 
 just 
And this isn't just Tom Friedman, it's actually provable in case after case after case. 
 just 
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it. 
i mean
You know, frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology. 
you know
He wrote a long time ago, you know, thanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, mini-cams and more, the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. 
you know
You see them on YouTube, in dance competitions, film festivals and more. 
you see
But I want to be clear, just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. 
 just 
And absolutely -- I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy, dollars spent in restaurants or on parking, at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes, the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more. 
you know
But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward, especially in industries we can't even imagine yet, just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries, which few, if any of us come have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago. 
 just 
You know, we're bound together, not, I think by technology, entertainment and design, but by common cause. 
you know
And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification -- if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most? 
you know
You know, they were marginalized in the negotiation room. 
you know
You know, from an oceanic perspective, 450 is way too high. 
you know
Well, the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. 
well
And then we have the human-induced causes of climate change as well. 
well
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere, and we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide -- it's methane, ozone, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. 
 just 
You know, thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man-made causes and the natural causes. 
you know
So that trip just ended, and I can't show you too many results from that right now, but we'll go back one more year, to another drilling expedition I've been involved in. 
 just 
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish. 
well
But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description. 
you know
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up. 
you know
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica, just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. 
well
But here's the key thing: you know, the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold, that the planet warmed up enough -- and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade -- the planet warmed up enough that it became ... 
you know
And you know what? 
you know
We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. 
 just 
This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati, you know, where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level. 
you know
Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos. 
okay
You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this. 
you see
And just so you know, 1982-'83, that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. 
you know
So they're either just truly monster El Ninos, or they're just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming. 
 just 
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well. 
well
When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them, you see these light and dark bands. 
you see
And we just count on down to the bottom. 
 just 
In this case, at these islands, you know, corals are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water. 
you know
You know, we've warmed the globe about a degree Centigrade in the last century, in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the last century. 
you know
You know, that's the strength of our argument, that we are doing something that's truly different. 
you know
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere, from fossil fuels, from cement production. 
you know
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. 
 just 
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. 
you know
We used to do it just with ice cores, but in this case, we're going back 20 million years. 
 just 
So, Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year: "The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release." 
well
And I think that may very well be true, so I'll close with this. 
well
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely, but for the sake of the oceans, we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions as soon as possible. 
you know
I mean, it's quite brutal. 
i mean
The story starts with just a single person, a child, behaving a little strangely. 
 just 
I mean, these kids were web-taught, but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. 
i mean
And at TED here in February, their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. 
 just 
You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off, we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation. 
you know
It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up," but they might as well have. 
well
Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call "crowd-accelerated innovation." 
well
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. 
 just 
You know, innovation's hard work. 
you know
And the desire part comes, I guess, from social status, right? 
i guess
I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam, but if you can do something that goes viral, you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people. 
 just 
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting: because you can see the best, everyone can learn. 
 just 
Okay, step back a minute. 
okay
I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. 
i mean
You know, we've heard that this week -- this romantic notion of the lone genius with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world is misleading. 
you know
If you take programmers, you know, the whole open-source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation. 
you know
I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. 
i mean
I mean, look: if you can show instead of just describing, that problem goes away. 
 just 
Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling. 
well
But even leaving the screen out of it, there's still a lot more being transferred than just words. 
 just 
Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures, the vocal cadence, the facial expressions, the eye contact, the passion, the kind of awkward, British body language, the sense of how the audience are reacting, there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand, and whether you're inspired -- light, if you like, and desire. 
well
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. 
 just 
I mean, this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. 
i mean
that just went global. 
 just 
I mean, today, one person speaking can be seen by millions, shedding bright light on potent ideas, creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case, intense desire to laugh. 
i mean
I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula. 
i mean
And so, as we've thought about this, you know, it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. 
you know
I mean, does it have to be this painful, top-down process? 
i mean
I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had. 
i mean
I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl, in the back, at the right, in 15 years, might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren? 
i mean
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. 
 just 
 CA: You know what? 
you know
So, we have this ability as well. 
well
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks. 
 just 
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. 
well
Well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night. 
well
And you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs. 
you know
But recently, we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight, to actually find ways to improve the world, to do something better, to actually fix things, not just understand things. 
 just 
But what I'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic, but also actually early detection of an epidemic. 
 just 
And, in fact, this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs, but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds. 
 just 
But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. 
 just 
It can be expensive, not feasible, unethical, or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing. 
 just 
What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact, or a known fact, about social networks, which goes like this: Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do? 
you know
Imagine a very popular person in the social network -- like a party host who has hundreds of friends -- and a misanthrope who has just one friend, and you pick someone at random from the population; they were much more likely to know the party host. 
 just 
And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. 
 just 
And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu at Harvard College in the fall and winter of 2009, just a few months ago. 
 just 
Well, some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them. 
well
Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom, but where everyone is, and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet, and what they're buying based on their purchases. 
 just 
So the truckers are just going about their business, and they're buying fuel. 
 just 
One is fully passive, like I just described -- as in, for instance, the trucker example, where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way. 
 just 
Or another example would be, if you're a phone company, you figure out who's central in the network and you ask those people, "Look, will you just text us your fever every day? 
 just 
And actually, we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well-being. 
well
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay? 
okay
 Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it?  CP: Okay. 
okay
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs. 
well
So what I did is, I took all this research and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig, and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back. 
well
Then if you look around you in the bathroom, you see lots more products like shampoo, conditioner, anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion, but also toothpaste. 
you see
 Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough, of course." 
well
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one, because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts." 
well
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. 
well
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings, so the collagen is as well. 
well
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found. 
well
 And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email. 
well
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart And once it's in the right spot, they remove the outer shell, and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating, instantly. 
well
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin, and you can borrow it." 
okay
And they said, "Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve, because want his product to be associated with pigs." 
well
 Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy -- actually, to show that my first question, if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true. 
well
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. 
well
And what they showed me is that, well, firstly, that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens. 
well
And you might think I'm very fond of pigs, but actually -- well, I am a little bit -- but I'm more fond of raw materials in general. 
well
They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world. 
you know
We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know, are like that $40,000, brand new incubator, state-of-the-art technology, but more often than not, they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby. 
you know
I mean, this is one vision of it. 
i mean
You know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought, and the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity. 
you know
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab, we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope, and they see something in the tissue sample. 
you know
Could you just give me some time to do that?" 
 just 
So, in a sense, we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property, you know, building barricades, having secretive R&amp;D labs, patenting everything that we have, so that those ideas will remain valuable, and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas, But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time, if not more, valuing the premise of connecting ideas 
you know
and not just protecting them. 
 just 
And I'll leave you with this story, which I think captures a lot of these values, and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways. 
 just 
It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched, and we're in Laurel Maryland, at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. 
 just 
And it's Monday morning, and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. 
 just 
There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. 
you know
And before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic. 
well
And they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we're noticing small little frequency variations here. 
well
And they said, "Jeez, you know, we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away. 
you know
They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. 
you know
They run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks, turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the Earth, just from listening to this one little signal, going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do over lunch one morning. 
 just 
And they thought about it and they said, "Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here." 
well
I mean, here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch, this little passion that had developed, then they thought they were fighting the Cold War, and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte. 
 just 
Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa, and as you drive along, you look off to the side, and this is what you see: you see a field of graves. 
you see
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa, it just pales, because in South Africa, each year 300,000 mothers with HIV give birth to children. 
 just 
Well, less than one comes from the United States. 
well
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa. 
you see
A nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day, which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient. 
 just 
Well, back in 2001, when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug, a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient, would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test, explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine, explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding, and test the baby -- in minutes. 
well
Well, fortunately since 2001, we've got new treatments, new tests, and we're far more successful, but we don't have any more nurses. 
well
These women are here for care, but we know that just doing a test, just giving someone a drug, it's not enough. 
 just 
If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so it's just not going to work. 
 just 
You're going to be okay. You're going to live. 
okay
These mothers, we call them mentor mothers, are able to engage women who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies, have found out about being HIV-positive, who need support and education. 
 just 
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. 
 just 
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses. 
 just 
Well, maybe the most important engagement is the one-to-one, seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them, explaining how they can take care of themselves. 
well
And you see where this is going. 
you see
They delegate education about infant feeding, family planning, safer sex, actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. 
 just 
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea. 
 just 
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me. I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries. 
 just 
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. 
 just 
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story. 
you know
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now. 
you see
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. 
 just 
It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here." 
okay
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" -- it's thick.  So let me show you the shape-changing mobile. 
well
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, "Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content. 
okay
Incidentally, we see just one octave. 
 just 
The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. 
 just 
It's got no destination in mind -- it's just enjoying the journey. 
 just 
These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler. 
 just 
It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. 
you see
And thirdly, if you're in bad sound, it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. 
 just 
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health. 
 just 
And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you, if it's music that's made with good intention, made with love, generally. 
 just 
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece, and they're going into all kinds of devices. 
well
But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. 
 just 
It has just that sensor in it. 
 just 
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. 
 just 
And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor. 
 just 
This is a beautiful, new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data, not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep -- deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep. 
 just 
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. 
 just 
The rest of it is the bedside console; just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- I mean, really until now. 
 just 
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. 
 just 
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler, but the top is a very small GPS transceiver, which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident, giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors. 
you see
But we think of these tools as pointing outward, as windows and I'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors. 
 just 
The self is just our operation center, our consciousness, our moral compass. 
 just 
But it's not just skin-deep. 
 just 
You know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is, and you're willing to play along with me. 
you know
I could just go home now. 
 just 
Well, so far only one connectome is known, that of this tiny worm. 
well
Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons. 
 just 
I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true; I just want you to remember it. 
 just 
But this is just a single neuron. 
 just 
So you see how to find a synapse. 
you see
Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book. 
well
 You guys are laughing, but you know, this book changed my life. 
you know
I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side. 
 just 
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain. 
well
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain. 
 just 
So when show my friends this, sometimes they've told me, "You know, Sebastian, you should just give up. 
you know
Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite? 
well
At the present time, my collaborators and I, what we're aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain. 
 just 
Well, neurons, like trees, can grow new branches, and they can lose old ones. 
well
Well, it's true. 
well
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering. 
 just 
And as I told you just now, neural activity can change the connectome. 
 just 
Well, I propose a direct test. 
well
But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake. 
you know
Philosophers know this game very well. 
well
I believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists, but for all of us. 
 just 
To compensate this loss of inner control, they try to control the outside, very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately, this fits very well into the traditional side, regressive side, repressive side, restrictive side of the cultural context. 
well
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control. 
 just 
So here you see, this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan, and every morning it looks like this all over. 
you see
And another counselor said to me after the training, "You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village, but now I know, because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan." 
you know
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning. 
 just 
There was just no future. 
 just 
What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel." 
well
They were well-known in the community, they knew that customers were always right, and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves. 
well
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military." 
well
And after I gave them statistics, they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations." 
okay
So I said, "Okay." 
okay
We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom. 
you know
Why just run around? 
 just 
So it just showed you, you could do something about it. 
 just 
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. 
 just 
Yet, after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash. 
 just 
And this isn't just found in packaging. 
 just 
Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum, to heat our homes, power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you. 
you see
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible, to the forest floor, where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. 
 just 
And by using mycelium as a glue, you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry, and you can create materials with many different properties, materials that are insulating, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant -- materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts. 
 just 
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled. 
 just 
Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important, because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years, in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. 
well
And not just us, but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. 
 just 
But I think we should also just check the numbers, take a reality check here. 
 just 
And I want to ask the question -- and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well, because we believe in growth. 
well
But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement? 
 just 
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. 
 just 
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system, which is the role of investment. 
 just 
And this engine is not just economic value; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system, driven by our own insatiable appetites, driven in fact by a sense of anxiety. 
 just 
A life without shame: in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt, and today, well, you still need the shirt, but you need the hybrid car, the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun, the netbook and iPad, the list goes on -- an almost inexhaustible supply of goods, driven by this anxiety. 
well
But this -- I just want to show you some data here. 
 just 
This is what it looks like, essentially, this credit and debt system, just for the U.K. 
 just 
It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. 
 just 
The savings ratio, net savings, were below zero in the middle of 2008, just before the crash. 
 just 
This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings, just to stay in the game. 
 just 
This is a strange, rather perverse, story, just to put it in very simple terms. 
 just 
  But before we consign ourselves to despair, maybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right? 
 just 
And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt, to draw down our own savings even further, just so that we can get the show back on the road, so we can keep this growth-based economy going. 
 just 
Well, I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. 
well
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon, and it was just after -- actually, to be honest, too long after -- we had moved into a new house. 
 just 
Well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. 
well
Well, it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States, enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart -- companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia. 
well
And I just want to, very quickly, show you this. 
 just 
So we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term. 
 just 
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. 
 just 
An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept -- is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future, a shared present and a common future. 
 just 
So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy. 
 just 
 Chris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question. 
 just 
I mean, can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying, "GDP fell two percent this year. Good news! 
i mean
Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing. 
well
CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together, or is it going to be more just civil society and companies? 
 just 
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. 
 just 
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. 
 just 
We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. 
well
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. 
well
So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. 
you see
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job. 
well
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas. 
 just 
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data. 
 just 
We just need to put it together. 
 just 
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans. 
 just 
Here you see the data. 
you see
But first thing, when you see dots like this, you have to ask yourself: from where do the data come? 
you see
Then it just took another three months for [the] U.N. to get it into their server, and on Friday we got the new trend line -- it was down here. 
 just 
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer, and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning. 
 just 
You know, these economists, they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow. 
you know
If your economy grows with four percent, you ought to reduce child mortality four percent; if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. 
well
I have just divided it into two periods. 
 just 
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know, that we counted all the child deaths, even if we didn't do anything about it. 
you know
And then, you see, these were famine years. 
you see
It's not about just five years -- it's long-term investments. 
 just 
And down they went, you know. 
you know
I just want not to have any room for doubt -- you have to see that for yourself. 
 just 
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you. 
okay
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. 
 just 
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift. 
 just 
In another part of the same story, all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark, so birds, livestock and wild animals. 
 just 
It's a nice description because it's starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones, the plants that are just able to live. 
 just 
You know very well about professors. 
well
But it's also wrong about plants, because plants are not just able to live; they are able to sense. 
 just 
And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. 
 just 
Well, but this is something -- this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. 
well
They have just a kind of very low-level soul. 
 just 
Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known. 
well
Some of them are very well known, like the flowering. 
well
It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. 
 just 
Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination, but not just insects; even birds, reptiles, and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. 
 just 
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature, but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye. 
 just 
Until now, the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. 
 just 
Well, if you want to fly, it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds. 
well
Well, thank you for your attention. 
well
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places? 
you know
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector. 
well
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change. 
well
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people. 
 just 
in a country like Ethiopia, and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008. 
you see
Well, they're already starting talk about this. 
well
Well, it's aspirational. 
well
And they don't just guess what makes people happy; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life. 
 just 
 K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫ ♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫ ♫ See the champions take the field now ♫ ♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫ 
 oh 
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages. 
well
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations. 
well
Well, you work with the community. 
well
 Now, it's not just a funny headline -- it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. 
 just 
Well, why is all of this so important? 
well
Well how did that happen? 
well
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south. 
 just 
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio. 
well
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated." 
you see
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, then in the future we make together, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola. 
 just 
This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings. 
 just 
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong. 
you know
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly, but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here -- instead of asking you for urine samples, I'll ask you for a mouse sample. 
 just 
What's the --  How did you know that? They did. 
you know
Vodka, gin --  Yes. Yes. You know your mice well. 
well
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though, there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. 
 just 
What it does is a very simple idea of taking -- 80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan is building related -- we take, just like a commercial greenhouse, we take the CO2 from the building -- CO2-enriched air -- we force it through the urban agriculture facility, and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air. 
 just 
And what I want to show you is -- actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing -- which is a solar chimney -- we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment -- that passively draws air up. 
 just 
Okay, so I want to show you just two more interfaces, because I think one of our big challenges is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems, not only through this model of twisted personalized health, but through the animals with whom we cohabit. 
 just 
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal, elk in Westchester County. 
you know
But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. 
well
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay.  So there was several of these. 
okay
It is in your interests that I'm healthy, happy, well-fed. 
well
The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched -- it's actually officially launched next week -- with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League. 
 just 
By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies, new interactive technologies, present to re-script our interactions, to script them, not just as isolated, individuated interactions, but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something, we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges. 
 just 
Do you see? 
you see
So I was led to write this song just for her, just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. 
 just 
♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ ♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ ♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫ ♫ you gonna have to send me home ♫ ♫ 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ Now you might not be able to sing that out loud, but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are. 
you know
So but anyways, here's the thing -- is it reminds me of this, which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner. 
you see
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. 
i guess
Recording: Okay, here's something. 
okay
ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails, and with their permission, converted them to MP3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails. 
 just 
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try. 
well
Some came from the party who had just lost. 
 just 
 ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫ ♫ I don't know why but it helps me get over it ♫ ♫ The words of the song just move me along ♫ ♫ And somehow I get over it ♫ ♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫ ♫ I keep on trying despite ♫ ♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫ 
 just 
♫ I keep on trying despite ♫ ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫ Okay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you. 
okay
And the person who didn't, it turned out, had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job. 
 just 
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?" 
you know
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job, and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety." 
 just 
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it." 
okay
 ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities, just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on, so I could just get their voices back. 
 just 
Recording: ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ZF: So that's one of the better ones, really. 
okay
I just want to say thanks for even considering it." 
 just 
 ♫ Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on ♫ ♫ And things that looked so good yesterday ♫ ♫ are now shades of gray ♫ ♫ And it seems like the world is spinning ♫ ♫ while I'm standing still ♫ ♫ Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell ♫ ♫ And then you say ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
okay
♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ And now the words sing ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ Now everybody sings ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 just 
♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ Thank you. 
 just 
This frustrated and confused me; I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do, and I was excited to do, but no matter what I would do, I would fail. 
 just 
I mean who can argue with that? 
i mean
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well -- think of that as financial services for the poor. 
well
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. 
 just 
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. 
 just 
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school, so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa. 
by the way
I just got this impression that the money would work. 
 just 
The fourth year, we were just short of 100. 
 just 
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present. 
 just 
Because as that happens, I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open, more just and more creative, to engage with each other and to help each other. 
 just 
Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. 
you see
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning. 
 just 
You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. 
you see
But in fact, when you give something to someone and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go, that's one thing. 
you know
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know, when all else is equal, given the option to have just money to do what you need to do, or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community, people choose the community plus the money. 
 just 
We make it really, really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. 
well
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools. 
 just 
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning, and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool. 
 just 
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it, just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. 
 just 
I don't think, even though we often hear, you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons, the religious reasons, "Here's why caring and giving will make you happier." 
you know
 Do you -- Do you see any Canine teeth? 
you see
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest. 
okay
Now having a large brain, as you know, is a big advantage, because you can actually influence your environment. 
you know
And within this structure, you see these two pinkish layers, which are actually the muscle. 
you see
This control of muscle is very, very important, because, you know, there can be reflexes. 
you know
We have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward, as you know. 
you know
And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat. 
you see
It's ephemeral just like us." 
 just 
I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world. 
 just 
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. 
 just 
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. 
i guess
You know what they say? 
you know
They say the print media is dying -- who says that? Well, the media. 
well
And you know the reason why, of course. 
you know
Yeah well, you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round, a nice round shape. 
well
Well, I know the world is flat now. 
well
Well, you've got mail. 
well
Well, the Internet has empowered us. 
well
It has empowered you, it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well. 
well
 You know, these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. 
you know
I mean -- I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually. 
i mean
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24 who received the assignment to draw the prophet -- 12 of them refused. Did you know that? 
you know
You know the story. 
you know
Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table, and since you're in my kitchen, please meet my wife. 
you see
So you see the style is different. 
you see
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now." 
well
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point. 
i mean
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together -- anti-government, pro-government, Christian, Muslim, of course, English-speaking, well, you name it. 
well
Well I believe that in any context anywhere, he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. 
well
What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many? 
well
Well, you are to ride a bicycle, carrying your own weight and also some other weight, so that you can earn the bread for the day. 
well
Well, poor do not remain poor; they become lower-middle-class. 
well
And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true: it's not just Ratan Tata, it's the house of Tatas over time. 
 just 
And it was that compassion which bothered them, because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain, a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. 
by the way
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford, one lakh car, $2,000 car." 
well
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. 
well
For example, how we started: Ratan just began with a five-engineer team, young people in their mid-twenties. 
 just 
And he said, "Well, I won't define the vehicle for you, but I will define the cost for you. 
well
And the Nano team average age was just 27 years. 
 just 
I mean, it was incredible innovation. 
i mean
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way, as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers. 
well
And the seat riser, for example, serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. 
well
When the Model T was launched -- and this is, by the way, all the figures that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices -- Model T was 19,700 by Ford. 
by the way
It is not just technological, it is social innovation that we talk about. 
 just 
And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment, is the one which is going to take the world forward, is going to make a difference, not just for a few, but for everyone. 
 just 
You just don't have it. 
 just 
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way, whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day, as so on. 
by the way
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs. 
you know
Let us just take an example. 
 just 
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way, and 20 of them. 
by the way
You know something? This has been achieved in India. 
you know
The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge, however, scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men, not molecule to mice to men, you know. 
you know
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis, for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm. 
 just 
Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. 
 just 
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people, not just a few people. 
 just 
And mind you, it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. 
 just 
Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way, for certain other different reasons. 
by the way
You know, incubators for infants, for example. 
you know
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion -- compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. 
 just 
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length. 
you know
Now, anybody has that capacity, which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. 
 just 
It's not just prevailing at war, though war still persists. 
 just 
You know, it looks at economic power measured by GDP. 
you know
But you might ask, well so what in any case? 
well
Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play? 
 just 
How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum, but positive sum. 
 just 
In that sense, if we define our interests, for example, for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century, keeping an open trading system, keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas -- those were good for Britain, they were good for others as well. 
well
But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list. 
 just 
Well, how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem? 
well
Well folks, we have a protein problem. 
well
Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. 
well
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy, grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. 
 just 
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you. 
well
I remember well the meals of my childhood. 
well
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. 
well
But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. 
 just 
I'm a bug lover, myself -- not from childhood, by the way, but rather late. 
by the way
And biological pest control, by the way, or these good bugs that we are talking about, they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years, for a long, long time. 
by the way
Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here? 
you see
You just twist leaves, and you see a whole new world of minute insects, or little spiders of one millimeter, one and a half, two millimeters long, and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. 
you see
Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. 
well
You see the mother in between and two daughters, probably on the left and right, and a single egg on the right-hand side. 
you see
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. 
you see
This is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite, by the way, one millimeter, two millimeters long, not more than that, running quickly, hunting, chasing the spider mites. 
 just 
By the way, they are hungry always. 
by the way
By the way, it's springtime now in Israel. 
by the way
By the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons. 
by the way
Those aphids secrete some sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew, and this just globs the upper parts of the plant. 
 just 
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it. 
you see
By the way, the aphid tries to escape. 
by the way
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside, in fact, a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out. 
you see
You can see, by the way, in different movies, etc., it takes just a few minutes. 
 just 
There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. 
 just 
By the way, all these weird names -- I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures, okay, just the popular names. 
 just 
This is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper. 
 just 
This adult pierces the thrips, sucking it within just several minutes, just going to the other prey, continuing all over the place. 
 just 
So this is a very positive situation, by the way. 
by the way
Everything is just fine under these circumstances. 
 just 
By the way, they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand, and a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer, which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures. 
you see
You see under a microscope. 
you see
You see in the upper left corner, you see a single predatory mite. 
you see
You see this ampoule. You see this one. 
you see
By the way, the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. 
by the way
But if we go, for example, to this place, Southeast Israel, the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley, where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located, especially under greenhouse conditions, or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to Eilat, you see this just in the middle of the desert. 
you see
Number two, many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance, that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals, just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics. 
 just 
Public demand -- the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals, the more growers become aware of the fact they should, wherever they can and wherever possible, replace the chemical control Even here, there is another grower, you see, very interested in the bugs, the bad ones and the good ones, wearing this magnifier already on her head, just walking safely in her crop. 
you see
Because, you see, this is the reality. 
you see
At the other end of the scale, the game Farmville that you may well have heard of, has 70 million players and most of these players are playing it almost every day. 
well
And by this, I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate, the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. 
i mean
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes, getting better and better stuff in them. 
 just 
So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people -- no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers -- and you work out, if you make the pie rate about 25 percent -- that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy. 
well
You find that -- you know, between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going. 
you know
But we don't just have pies in the boxes. 
 just 
But we don't just do that either. 
 just 
And also, we say, "Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?" 
well
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do, but in a game we can just say, "Right, well. 
well
Well, I've come up with seven things that, I think, show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. 
well
And if you think about using this in testing, in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training, you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism. 
 just 
We just want to go back and find out more. 
 just 
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K., where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain. 
 just 
But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts." 
you know
Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest, but that today, a decade on, every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system -- tens of millions of people. 
 just 
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. 
i mean
And I just look at this, and I think, yes, we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets, by using elements of uncertainty, by using these multiple targets, by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system, by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets to collaborate and compete, to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. 
 just 
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government, among others, is literally starting to pay people to lose weight. 
well
But again, those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal, to take the data, to take the observations, of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement. 
 just 
Well unfortunately, power corrupts, and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power, including doing bad things to elections. 
well
Well, what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that, after you drop your vote into the ballot box. 
well
Well in the face of all these bad headlines, researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. 
well
Well, the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. 
well
I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s, when I was seven or eight years old, watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on. 
i guess
And it was really a turning point in my life, where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration. 
 just 
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. 
 just 
But we got up there, and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive? 
 just 
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries, especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here. 
you see
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well -- very important bird nesting site, some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world. 
well
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati, and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. 
well
After I got back, I said, okay, this is amazing, what we found. 
okay
And for some reason they didn't want me to come, or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while, but finally they said, "Okay, you can come. 
okay
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch. 
okay
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. 
you know
The Oak Foundation and National Geographic have been big funders of this as well. 
well
Well, the good news is it's recovered and recovering fast, faster than any reef we've seen. 
well
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago when we returned to the Phoenix Islands and discovered that, because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy, the coral is booming, is just booming back. 
 just 
It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases, it's hard to get well, you might die, but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better. 
well
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. 
 just 
And that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati as well as the self-interest of the world. 
well
I've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands, but every other green patch on that has its own story. 
 just 
 Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist If you look very carefully, you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. 
you see
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. 
 just 
It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some. 
 just 
And second, just as in a radio broadcast, you can communicate with many receivers at once. 
 just 
There's no high-tech gizmos here, just biology revealed through biology. 
 just 
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. 
well
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore. 
 just 
They just stand around and groom excessively. 
 just 
Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells. 
 just 
Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off. 
well
And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay. 
okay
And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. 
okay
And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. 
 just 
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible. 
 just 
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit. 
you know
The entire county is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed. 
 just 
And when I say we, I mean Project H, but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller, who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder. 
i mean
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. 
 just 
Aside from, you know, getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place, it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. 
you know
And so this starts in four weeks, at the end of the summer, and my partner and I, Matthew and I, just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. 
 just 
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom. 
well
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983. 
 just 
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks, unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. 
 just 
In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved. 
 just 
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines, but the killing and displacement there continues as well, and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. 
well
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news. 
well
The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003, with just 20,000 killed. 
 just 
But for many parts of Africa, a colleague of mine once put it this way, "The cease-fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning." 
 just 
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint, explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008. 
well
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. 
well
Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues, innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation. 
well
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM, the American Indian Movement, or of Russell Means, or Leonard Peltier, or of the stand-off at Oglala, then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S. 
you know
So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain, and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people. 
you see
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. 
 just 
between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you? 
 just 
Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment, promote trade. 
 just 
We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. 
 just 
And you can just look at the headlines. 
 just 
Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago -- stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. 
 just 
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards, code of conduct. 
okay
Well, we don't. 
well
The numbers just make you want to zone out. 
 just 
It starts with just giving people back their dignity. 
 just 
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes. 
well
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven, is complex, but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. 
well
First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. 
 just 
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to. 
well
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid. 
you see
Well actually, I think the answer is staring us right in the face: Use computers. 
well
Well, I think there are about three reasons: technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies, what I call "everyday living" -- to function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago: figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things -- and thirdly, what I would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking. 
well
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking, starting with posing the right question. 
well
I estimated that, just today, across the world, we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. 
 just 
So we better be damn sure -- and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose. 
by the way
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first. 
well
So just because paper was invented before computers, it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. 
 just 
 So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age, I didn't make these. 
you know
 If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best tool. 
 just 
This is just nuts. 
 just 
But you see, when you're using a computer, you can just substitute. 
you see
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math. 
 just 
Well, another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. 
well
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem. 
well
And by the way, she was also very insistent on being able to change the color, an important feature for this demonstration. 
by the way
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here. 
you see
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. 
 just 
And you know if you walk across a chasm, you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all -- No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully. 
you know
No, this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding, and you know who I mean: Charles Darwin. 
you know
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere. 
 just 
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. 
i mean
Darwin himself, by the way, had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. 
by the way
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, I mean, you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. 
i mean
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape, a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. 
 just 
The trees, by the way, are often preferred if they fork near the ground, that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. 
by the way
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view, or evidence of water in a bluish distance, indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road, perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline, that extends into the distance, almost inviting you to follow it. 
well
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago. 
well
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. 
i mean
You know, it's an old line, but it has been shown to work -- "Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?" 
you know
We find beauty in something done well. 
well
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. 
 just 
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces, neither can I disclose their true names, and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates, offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes' ride from here -- well, like everything in Israel. 
well
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. 
well
And I'm just standing there, watching this scene with a complete disbelief, not knowing what to do. 
 just 
Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. 
well
And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened. 
well
You know, perspective that mountain biking can really teach you. 
you know
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka -- that's where you're supposed to climb now -- and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there." 
you see
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me, adults, who are sitting there listening to him -- and he says, "And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. 
 just 
And for me it's just the idea that, if this little girl graduates as a whole person, chances are she'll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on. 
 just 
And when the natural breeze isn't enough, the kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know. 
you know
And you know what these are. 
you know
And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -- you're all really smart, just do the math. 
 just 
And they work. People use them. People are okay. 
okay
 We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives, and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean? 
okay
But what's happening, our learning-different kids -- dyslexic -- we've renamed them prolexic -- are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms. 
well
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules: be local, let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build. 
 just 
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. 
 just 
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. 
you see
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. 
well
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. 
 just 
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. 
 just 
But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. 
 just 
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. 
 just 
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. 
 just 
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are." 
 just 
I'll just say, July. 
 just 
In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms. 
 just 
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain Injury. 
 just 
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. 
 just 
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. 
 just 
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. 
you see
You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. 
you know
These just become numbers that we refer to. 
 just 
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going? 
you know
Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women? 
you know
If we just reverse that distribution of funds, perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. 
 just 
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now. 
okay
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay. 
okay
And then you'll hear people say, "Well, it doesn't really matter where I am, as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends." 
well
I just did tasks. 
 just 
That's not really what I mean. 
i mean
If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones -- if someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens -- you don't just pick up where you left off. 
 just 
And what ends up happening -- you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up, and you're like, "I didn't sleep very well. 
well
You've got to go through phases and stuff, and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well. 
well
I mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here? 
i mean
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, these things are just modern-day smoke breaks. 
 just 
And meetings are just toxic, terrible, poisonous things during the day at work. 
 just 
I mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop? 
i mean
Because the offices are well-equipped; everything is there for them to do the work. 
well
 Pick one Thursday once a month, and cut it in half, just the afternoon -- I'll make it easy for you. 
 just 
So just the afternoon, one Thursday. 
 just 
First Thursday of the month, just the afternoon, nobody in the office can talk to each other. 
 just 
And the last suggestion I have is that, if you do have a meeting coming up, if you have the power, just cancel it. 
 just 
I don't mean move it; I mean just erase it from memory, it's gone. 
 just 
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. 
 just 
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday, just forget about them, and things will be fine. 
 just 
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. 
 just 
It was all just gone. 
 just 
Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. 
 just 
 Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. 
you see
Well, if that ruins your life, well then you shouldn't live there. 
well
And those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. 
you see
So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, there, where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open, you throw your laundry down. 
 just 
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well. 
well
 Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange. 
 just 
I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. 
 just 
Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't. 
well
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. 
 just 
"Okay, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. 
okay
Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall. 
well
Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective. 
well
Well, that's just a myth. 
well
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready." 
 just 
"Oh, just looking for some header material," waiting for that kudos. 
 just 
And he had the wherewithal to say, he said, "You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that, but right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. 
you know
It's a chattel mortgage, just like furniture, just like a car. 
 just 
Are we just being numbingly stupid? 
 just 
 But you know what they did? They hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..." 
you know
 My oh my, that makes it worse. 
 oh 
That happens in the building industry as well. 
well
Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my. 
 oh 
We like to hang together in groups, just like wildebeests, just like lions. 
 just 
And so you see this in junior high a lot. 
you see
And so that happens in the building industry as well. 
well
But that's okay. 
okay
Early on, contractors come by and say, "Dan, you're a cute little bunny, but you know, this just isn't going to work. 
you know
And so what we've done -- and this isn't just in housing. 
 just 
It's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit. 
 just 
And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say, "You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. 
you know
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. 
 just 
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? 
you know
I want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. 
 just 
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. 
you know
Well, the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East, of a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels. 
well
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time, and finally she came back and said, "Well, I don't know if I can help you, but at least, if you want, you can have my camel." 
well
Let me give you just a story, an example. 
 just 
Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk. 
well
There was a war going on, as you know. 
you know
Let me just ask you one question first. 
 just 
But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was. 
 just 
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. 
 just 
You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human. 
you know
So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people; he's alive, he's a living presence. 
 just 
And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it. 
 just 
But it's not just about psychology; it's about economics. 
 just 
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad, is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. 
 um
Let me just show you one thing. 
 just 
So let me just leave you with three things. 
 just 
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? 
well
And here you see just a selection. 
you see
So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing. 
 just 
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. 
well
And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants. 
you see
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. 
 just 
And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us. 
okay
Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. 
well
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident." 
 just 
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good. 
well
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere. 
 just 
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. 
you see
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. 
you see
It's just very good food. 
 just 
Well that's just a matter of mindset. 
well
And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. 
well
And some might think, well they're not yet available. 
well
Well they are. 
well
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. 
 just 
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing. 
 just 
They just make it [with] nuts or something. 
 just 
Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures. 
well
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. 
you see
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. 
well
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test. 
 just 
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way. 
 just 
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. 
 just 
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. 
well
I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done. 
 just 
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent. 
 just 
Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. 
okay
Basically a restaurant just like any other. 
 just 
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. 
well
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. 
okay
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. 
 just 
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. 
well
Okay. So this is my next project. 
okay
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. 
i mean
And no one's doing that just yet. 
 just 
By the way, the pronunciation is "Eyjafjallajokull." 
by the way
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. 
you see
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. 
well
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. 
 just 
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. 
 just 
But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter. 
 just 
But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland -- and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. 
well
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. 
well
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? 
you see
So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. 
i guess
That night she won the election, because she came back -- not just because of his crappy behavior -- but she came back and said, "Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it." 
well
Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. 
 just 
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; 
 just 
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood. 
 just 
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay. 
 just 
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. 
 just 
And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine. 
 just 
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box. 
 just 
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what. 
 just 
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes." 
 just 
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. 
 just 
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. 
well
You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. 
you see
So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. 
well
So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. 
 just 
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.  
 just 
They just get the school which parents choose for them. 
 just 
You've got to just respond to the situation. 
 just 
What you see, if you see the title called "PM's car held." 
you see
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. 
you see
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. 
you see
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. 
you see
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. 
 just 
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. 
 just 
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. 
 just 
The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. 
 just 
And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women. 
 just 
And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. 
 just 
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. 
 just 
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph -- it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day. 
 just 
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. 
you see
You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing. 
well
And those are all things that women do very well. 
well
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. 
 just 
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? 
 just 
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. 
well
So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. 
 just 
I mean they have much larger vocabulary. 
i mean
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. 
 just 
And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. 
 just 
But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. 
 just 
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. 
 just 
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. 
well
I had to just sit and watch. 
 just 
They can talk -- they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. 
well
But I gave them the room to just do the thing. 
 just 
And I said, "Well what makes it great?" 
well
RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing, which is, of course, relevant, but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. 
 just 
The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. 
 just 
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. 
i mean
 This, as you know, is an act of heresy. 
you know
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. 
well
RG: Uh oh. 
 uh 
And of course, it made me question, if I wasn't able to have another child, what would that mean for my marriage, and just me as a woman. 
 just 
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. 
 just 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. 
 just 
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. 
i mean
And so we all remember as children, the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation, and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. 
 just 
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. 
 just 
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience, particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. 
you know
So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. 
 just 
I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes -- that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume. 
 just 
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. 
you know
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption." 
well
Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? 
you know
I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded. 
i mean
I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. 
i mean
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial -- are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we." 
 just 
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. 
well
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is. 
 just 
So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. 
 just 
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. 
 just 
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. 
 just 
With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted. 
well
Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character -- this leopard. 
well
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of "CSI" -- something like 28 years. 
well
Well, we needn't have worried. 
well
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, "he who greets with fire," and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character. 
you know
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. 
 just 
Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. 
well
 You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly -- the dry top angle, by the way. 
by the way
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight -- that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. 
 just 
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see. 
you see
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. 
okay
DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant. 
i guess
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved -- and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. 
well
There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. 
well
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. 
 just 
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. 
 just 
So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. 
well
And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. 
well
So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. 
 just 
And so I said, "Did you just move into this office?" 
 just 
A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women. 
i guess
There's a really good study that shows this really well. 
well
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked. 
okay
They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. 
well
I said, "You're thinking about this just way too early." 
 just 
They're just not moving. 
 just 
It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful. 
 just 
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments. 
 just 
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars to send one person to Harvard as well. 
well
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me. 
okay
Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. 
well
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well. 
well
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners, but everybody. 
 just 
And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake. 
 just 
Most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well. 
well
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia. 
i mean
I mean, they are not -- they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. 
i mean
But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer. 
 just 
And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. 
 just 
They're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. 
 just 
The numbers just aren't there. 
 just 
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well. 
well
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. 
well
Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. 
well
And when we do that, our neighbors -- be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country -- will be just fine. 
 just 
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. 
i mean
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home," meant that my payday -- or someone else's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. 
 just 
To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts. 
 just 
I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- I'm not trying to feed the habit. 
 just 
And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well. 
well
And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. 
 just 
But since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk became this little thing. 
 just 
The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006. 
 just 
What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. 
well
And I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?" 
well
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant." 
well
 And I was like, "Okay." 
okay
So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller." 
 just 
And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. 
you know
And maybe stories are just data with a soul. 
 just 
And maybe I'm just a storyteller. 
 just 
And so I said, "You know what? 
you know
Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller." 
 just 
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. 
 just 
And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. 
you know
So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. 
you know
Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one "opportunity for growth?" 
well
Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. 
well
And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. 
you know
As you know, it's not going to turn out well. 
well
 You know this. 
you know
I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. 
okay
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those. 
 just 
My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. 
 just 
They just talked about it being necessary. 
 just 
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job -- you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. 
you know
Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody. 
you know
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay." 
okay
And I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue. 
well
 "I just need some strategies." 
 just 
And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. 
you know
And it doesn't just have to be addiction. 
 just 
There's just blame. 
 just 
You know how blame is described in the research? 
you know
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh." 
 just 
Our job is to look and say, "You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging." 
you know
We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... 
 just 
just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, "I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive." 
 just 
Or if they do have our interests at heart, we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. 
well
So if we find just the right incentives, they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly, and if we come up with the right rules and regulations, they won't drive us all over a cliff. 
 just 
So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that. 
 just 
Well if you think about it, it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. 
well
The rules are like the notes on the page, and that gets you started, but then you dance around the notes on the page, coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. 
 just 
So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. 
you see
And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom, which Aristotle thought was the master virtue. 
 just 
And by the way, this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence, so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. 
by the way
Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble, the so-called "bubble kids" -- kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. 
 just 
What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason -- namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. 
 just 
Well, one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen 108 vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year, and out of 108, guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. 
well
There's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe -- encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients. 
well
And in order to be an effective doctor, you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. 
 just 
Well, to love well and to work well, you need wisdom. 
well
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say it -- I felt like saying, "You know what? 
you know
they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight." 
okay
 While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture. 
 just 
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who've begun reading the Koran, but given up, disconcerted by its "otherness." 
well
 Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach, as though God -- and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -- were just another author on the bestseller list. 
 just 
My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary, so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side, along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic. 
well
The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. 
well
It's just 29 words in Arabic, but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation. 
 just 
The word used four times is Houris, rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts, or as fair, high-bosomed virgins. 
well
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight. 
well
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity, and I have never had a patient tell me that "I really want you to be creative during surgery," and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. 
i guess
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level. 
well
I've always -- just as a listener, as just a fan -- I listen to that, and I'm just astounded. 
 just 
And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process. 
 just 
Well it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective -- we talked a lot about innovation today -- the science of innovation, how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy, and truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative. 
well
I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers, and I myself, I'm not going to give you many answers today, just ask a lot of questions. 
 just 
If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same, but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain, but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. 
 just 
  CL: Okay, so it works. 
okay
You can't just sort of -- "It's great we've got this keyboard." 
 just 
There's a scale paradigm, which is just playing a scale up and down, memorized. 
 just 
Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising? 
 just 
So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it. 
 just 
MP: Nope. Nothing's in my pockets. Nurse: Okay. 
okay
This whole notion that music is a language -- well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all, and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. 
well
And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now, and we're just getting all the data together, so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully. 
 just 
Now when I think about improvisation and the language, well what's next? 
well
With this big screen, you can all rap with me. Okay? 
okay
Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing. 
 just 
CL: That was recorded in the scanner, by the way. 
by the way
He's just memorized a rhyme for us. 
 just 
Emmanuel: ♫ Top of the beat with no repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme make me complete ♫ ♫ Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressed ♫ CL: Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain? 
okay
Well, this is actually four rappers' brains. 
well
So just to conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask, and like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them. 
 just 
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. 
well
Do you know which group you're in? 
you know
She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be. 
 just 
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. 
 just 
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. 
well
So how do you know if your breasts are dense? 
you know
Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report. 
well
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera. 
 just 
It's just way too much equipment. 
 just 
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. 
well
Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers. 
well
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. 
 just 
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. 
 just 
And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise. 
 just 
So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications 
 just 
And if you've ever had a mammogram -- if you're old enough to have had a mammogram -- you know what comes next: pain. 
you know
But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression. 
 just 
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. 
well
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. 
 just 
We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you. 
 just 
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. 
 just 
My marriage wasn't going well, and we just were growing further and further apart. 
well
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of, had been battling mental illness for some time. 
 just 
And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness, you know how challenging it can be. 
you know
I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough -- who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- 
 just 
I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000. 
 just 
And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto, when, in my inbox, 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. 
 just 
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly. 
 just 
And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well, too, with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart, and when that bad news washes over you, and when that pain sponges and soaks in, I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. 
well
Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old. 
 just 
And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once, too. 
 just 
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL, he started joining clubs. 
i mean
 And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person, and that's what authenticity is all about. 
 just 
It's just about being you and being cool with that. 
 just 
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys. 
 just 
 I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here." 
 just 
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?" 
you know
And when we did, my dad would say, "Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house, so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?" 
 just 
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about." 
 just 
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. 
i mean
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 80 billion dollars? 
you know
 He said, "You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray." 
you know
As most of you know, she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma. 
you know
She was just released a couple of weeks ago, and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free, because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon, agitating for change. 
 just 
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. 
you know
But if they were together planting trees for the environment, it was okay -- creativity. 
okay
But it's not just iconic women like Shirin, like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai -- it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world. 
 just 
She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen. 
 just 
Well, traditional definition is "an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments." 
well
Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. 
well
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. 
well
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday." 
well
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it." 
well
And he said, "Well, okay." 
well
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. 
 just 
They're not just sitting there. 
 just 
And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection -- it's just done in a different way. 
 just 
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. 
 just 
So I thought, okay, I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. 
okay
And, working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer, I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that, inside this object, which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials. 
 just 
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science -- well, steel comes from iron, so I phoned up an iron mine. 
well
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train, and then was faced with the problem: Okay, how do you make this rock into components for a toaster? 
okay
It's not anymore, but I found a retired geology professor to take me down, and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine." 
okay
So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic, toxic conditions. 
 just 
But even then they weren't convinced and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did. 
okay
And geologists have actually christened -- well, they're debating whether to christen -- the age that we're living in -- they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene, the age of Man. 
well
And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. 
 just 
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest. 
to be honest
I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing "the Other" by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. 
by the way
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. 
 just 
Well, she was shocked. 
well
But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. 
 just 
And the point is that, for boys, the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now. 
well
And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black, if you happen to be poor, if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. 
by the way
If you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well, they're playing video games, and they're gambling online all night long, and they're playing World of Warcraft, and that's affecting their academic achievement." 
well
I mean, really. 
i mean
"Okay, what is she telling you to write?" 
okay
"All right. Well, what do you want to write? What do you want to write about?" 
well
And the answer is no, he's just a boy. 
 just 
He's just a little boy. 
 just 
It's not okay to write these kinds of things So that's the first reason: zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. 
okay
And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys. 
i guess
And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here. 
i guess
Have you seen the ads? 
you see
There are some great examples out there of schools -- the New York Times just talked about a school recently. 
 just 
And they say these things as if it's okay. 
okay
Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, "Well I guess that was just a place for girls. 
well
I just did something I've never done before. 
 just 
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil This is the boat we were on, by the way. 
by the way
But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up. 
well
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do, or not to do, Now as you know, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?" 
you know
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. 
 just 
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay. 
okay
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?" 
by the way
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places. 
 just 
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus. 
 just 
They were just beyond our sights. 
 just 
Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. 
 just 
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. 
 just 
You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. 
you see
And just because of someone's hunch, I wasn't going to give it up. 
 just 
Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis, who is dry as toast, but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive, they wanted me to live a meaningful life. 
 just 
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. 
well
I like to do things big, and it meant one thing: there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan, and it's not just a drug; it's a way of life. 
 just 
But his -- well, the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. 
well
I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but I just kept on going. 
 just 
Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay. 
okay
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it? 
 just 
When we do, we will find that patients don't just survive; we thrive. 
 just 
So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there's a spill; they're a problem where there's not. 
 just 
The other thing that we don't often appreciate is it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. 
 just 
And people say, "Well, they should just buy a different product." 
well
Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. 
well
And if that weren't bad enough, if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like "Cancer Alley" and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use, at the point of disposal, once again, it's poor people who bear the burden. 
 just 
 "You've served so well." 
well
The little bottle says, "I just don't know." 
 just 
It's just the poor people get hit first and worst. 
 just 
Well the root of this problem, in my view, is the idea of disposability itself. 
well
You see, if you understand the link to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people, you arrive at a very troubling, but also very helpful, insight: In order to trash the planet, you have to trash people. 
you see
People who are just learning about this stuff, biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. 
 just 
It turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. 
well
Well that insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species. 
well
I mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved. 
i mean
Well that idea of biomimicry, respecting the wisdom of all species, of democracy and social justice, respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people, would give us a different society. 
well
We just had this vote, and everybody's like, "Well, not in our state. 
well
Well, when you start working on issues like plastic, you realize that the whole thing is connected, and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms. 
well
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices. 
 just 
That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data, which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. 
 just 
Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have, we can, just in a few seconds, get 24,000 images out of a body, and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data, or 800 phone books, and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books. 
 just 
What's about to happen -- and we're seeing this; it's beginning -- a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well. 
well
So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. 
well
And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds, and that would correspond to one terabyte of data -- that's 800,000 books and 16 kilometers of phone books. 
 just 
They would put up 25,000 images, they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay. 
okay
But of course, the block of data just contains the amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. 
 just 
And you know, going back maybe 10 years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine. 
you know
And you know, for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer, and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. 
you know
But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer, I can just put in a clip plane. 
 just 
And just by changing the functions, then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. 
 just 
I can look at the skull structure, and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman, and that's where they went in. 
okay
We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner, and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set. 
 just 
In the forensic case -- and this is something that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies So this will be the typical workflow situation. 
 just 
The police will decide -- in the evening, when there's a case coming in -- they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy? 
okay
The person was killed by stabs in the heart, but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. 
 just 
Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. 
 just 
It really just works like a huge iPhone. 
 just 
Okay, now that we're talking about touch, let me move on to really "touching" data. 
okay
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners, that just in 0.3 seconds, I can scan the whole heart, and I can do that with time resolution. 
 just 
So just looking at this heart, I can play back a video here. 
 just 
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery, and do that with high-quality resolution data. 
i mean
And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there, going into the MRI system, and he was wearing goggles. 
 just 
Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. 
well
And he's also hearing our instructions The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well, and it's shining through, because all of the data is inside this volume. 
well
And in just a second here you will see -- okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot. 
 just 
It's just a robot. 
 just 
The guy's voice comes back on the line, "Okay, now what?" 
okay
Because it's neither rare nor well done. 
well
Was that okay for my first time? 
okay
That's just a decade away. 
 just 
Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like, just as a beginning. 
 just 
Okay, it's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years, but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. 
okay
Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications. 
well
You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe: breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. 
you know
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West. 
well
Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han? 
you know
Well the reason, I think, essentially is, again, back to the civilization-state. 
well
And the reason for this is because -- well, there are two reasons, I think. 
well
And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. 
i mean
The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. 
by the way
The Chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually, as a member of the family -- not just in fact as a member of the family, but as the head of the family, the patriarch of the family. 
 just 
I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, "The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe." 
i mean
I mean, it's leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned. 
i mean
I mean, if you want an illustration of this, the Great Wall is one. 
i mean
So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China, which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today, which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. 
i suppose
You know, there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian. 
you know
I mean, take the question of East Asia. 
i mean
Well, maybe that's true, maybe that's an exaggeration. 
well
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. 
i mean
Okay, so how would I like to finish? 
okay
Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us? 
well
So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. 
well
If you want to get at the big part -- I mean from a public health level, where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues. 
i mean
I mean, they complain about it all the time. 
i mean
So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives. 
 just 
We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well. 
well
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?" 
i mean
So let me just spool it out a little bit. 
 just 
You need to connect it to their lives, Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. 
okay
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with. 
 just 
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts. 
 just 
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. 
well
So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. 
 just 
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. 
 just 
The after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. 
 just 
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal. 
okay
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. 
well
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. 
 just 
So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. 
 just 
So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. 
 just 
And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. 
 just 
And I just ate it up. 
 just 
Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table. 
well
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something? 
well
I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?" 
well
They'd just turned three, and they were into all things pink and purple. 
 just 
Anyway -- so they had just turned three, and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground, laughing with all the glee in the world. 
 just 
Now as soon as I had this idea, I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. 
okay
And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia, but not to have hair from Texas. 
okay
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice." 
well
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk, because that's where love comes from." 
 just 
And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record -- one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday -- the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word "friend." 
 just 
And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone -- I can say this I guess because you've done it here -- he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker." 
i guess
And I just love this ode to slow moving. 
 just 
Come the one year anniversary of my journey, I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey -- and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor. 
by the way
So I stand here today as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane. 
you see
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit -- but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is, at a similar meeting, back in the spring, Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks -- put the full resources of 23andMe, 
 just 
But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message: May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal, or to that college roommate, or to some person you may have turned away from. 
 just 
I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. 
i mean
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. 
 just 
How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple. 
well
Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world: it's short for "floating upwelling system." 
well
To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future. 
 just 
I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it, and that is all of us are makers. 
 just 
We don't just live, but we make. 
 just 
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. 
well
It doesn't come out particularly well, but that's a particularly tall bicycle. 
well
And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. 
 just 
And you can barely see it, but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. 
 just 
You know what those are, right? 
you know
And I'll tell you more about it, but just ... 
 just 
It didn't just exist. 
 just 
He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. 
 just 
And you can't see this very well on the screen, but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform. 
well
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. 
well
Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. 
well
They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think -- the military is doing drones -- well, there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles -- something that you could program to fly on its own, without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going. 
well
We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration. 
 just 
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace. 
 just 
Well he did a little bit better than free. 
well
It's really just been basic demographics. 
 just 
When they're monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income. 
you know
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. 
well
So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people? 
well
And I do it not just because it's fun -- though actually, it is really fun -- but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives -- for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health. 
 just 
Running -- it's basically just right, left, right, left -- yeah? 
 just 
I mean, we've been doing it for two million years, so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. 
i mean
And if you know it, then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth. 
you know
For some reason you guys are just really slow. 
 just 
 But you get to the marathon we were just talking about -- you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years. 
 just 
Well Emily Baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10, even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet, beat 492 other people. 
well
Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers. 
well
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness -- again, it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed -- the only thing we do really, really well is sweat. 
well
You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing, this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. 
you know
How do we spoil it? Well how do we spoil anything? 
well
And I think that, if anybody in here runs -- and I just had a conversation with Carol; we talked for two minutes backstage, and she's talking about plantar fasciitis. 
 just 
Geronimo was never saying, "Ah, you know something, my achilles -- I'm tapering. I got to take this week off," or "I need to cross-train. 
you know
All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day, which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances. 
 just 
Well, I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing. 
well
But maybe there's another benefit there as well. 
well
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping. 
i mean
So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. 
 just 
But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. 
 just 
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her. 
 just 
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them. 
 just 
On the other hand, it's a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. 
 just 
And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. 
well
And to be balanced, I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches. 
 just 
Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. 
well
So 20 years pass -- I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. 
 just 
But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?" 
i mean
Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. 
well
And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. 
 just 
The first was just the screen. 
 just 
This is just like video conferencing today. 
 just 
But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often. 
 just 
So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well. 
well
Sort of like a digital Jiminy -- as in the well-known fairy tale -- a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. 
well
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters? 
 just 
And the third was just a pen and paper log, because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program. 
 just 
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success. 
well
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know, always in a civil war, the ones affected most [are] the women and children. 
you know
We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. 
 just 
 And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when I was 16, and my sister was 11, when the civil war broke out. 
 just 
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage. 
you see
And I'm just going to talk through this animation. 
 just 
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. 
 just 
We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-organisms. 
 just 
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore. 
 just 
And with just a little bit of planning, we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people, reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. 
 just 
And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. 
 just 
So they just started spreading this on the land around, and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. 
 just 
This photograph was taken on completion day, and just one year later, it looked like that. 
 just 
But actually in mature ecosystems, you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. 
 just 
And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts. 
well
And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. 
 just 
They're not just possible; they're critical. 
 just 
Well actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four. 
well
My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. 
 just 
And actually, till I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. 
to be honest
So "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it? 
you know
And I just couldn't. 
 just 
 So, okay, I'm going to America. 
okay
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. 
i mean
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again. 
well
 And I try to live my dream -- well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good. 
well
 Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here. 
okay
Well actually, you are going to whistle along. 
well
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens. 
 just 
Okay, here it is. 
okay
   Okay. 
okay
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. 
well
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. 
 just 
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping. 
 just 
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other. 
 just 
He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. 
 just 
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. 
 just 
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not. 
you see
This is the full photograph, and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket, smoking a cigar. 
you see
Well, he was complicated. 
well
And I want to say to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion -- following on what Fred Luskin says -- that these flaws just make us human. 
 just 
So I want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. 
by the way
Well, it's got to do with your brain. 
well
Well, babies all over the world are what I like to describe as "citizens of the world." 
well
What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States, here in Seattle, as they listened to "ra" and "la" -- sounds important to English, but not to Japanese. 
you see
 We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. 
 just 
So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage, the same 12 sessions, but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. 
 just 
What you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever. 
you see
And that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. 
well
And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. 
 just 
It took almost two years just to register the land. 
 just 
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?" 
well
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya, just 200 miles away. 
 just 
And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. 
well
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you. 
okay
And so it's not only an option for them, but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us, to be like a concierge service. 
 just 
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available. 
well
Because it just creates more flexibility. 
 just 
The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses -- and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses, or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies, car manufacturers, who are beginning to offer their own car-share services as well as a second flanker brand, or as really a test, I think -- is to make sharing irresistible. 
well
or iTunes and the iPhone developer network, there are all these networks -- Facebook as well. 
well
Now we're saying that there's other options as well. 
well
In closing, and as we're moving towards the end, I just also want to encourage -- and I'm willing to share my failures as well, though not from the stage. 
well
 I would just like to say that one of the big things, when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other, but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation, is by sharing failures. 
 just 
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. 
 just 
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen. 
well
And then I thought, well this is fun. 
well
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. 
well
MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. 
well
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes." 
well
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council -- so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought -- well you know how we all are. 
well
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute. 
well
And so what I have felt -- from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity. 
 just 
And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage was, I had just arrived at the U.N., and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N. 
 just 
 PM: So when you look around the world and you see that, in many cases -- certainly in the Western world -- women are evolving into more leadership positions, and even other places some barriers are being brought down, but there's still so much violence, still so many problems, and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. 
you see
MA: Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change. 
well
We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this," and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?" 
well
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control, and she said, "Well I feel we should do this." 
well
The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out. 
 just 
MA: Well I think one of the things -- I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. 
well
I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. 
 just 
 PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven. 
well
And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital, trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said, "You must make him drink today," -- my father's been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether, by giving him this bottle, I might actually kill him. 
 just 
Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10? 
you know
Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you? 
you know
You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. 
you see
Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. 
well
Why was it that, when I had an operation, my doctor said to me, "Beware, Ms. Hertz, of hyperpyrexia," when he could have just as easily said, "Watch out for a high fever." 
 just 
And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. 
well
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's, but also shop-girls -- yeah. 
 just 
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. 
well
The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent, taking experts on, democratizing expertise, rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing, complex, difficult times. 
well
As teenagers -- just think back to your teenage years -- we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. 
 just 
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. 
well
Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them on honesty, intelligence, friendliness, violence. 
well
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. 
well
Because you might say, "Well, this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic." 
well
She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. 
 just 
He said you could see criminal faces, judging them just on the photographs that were showed. 
 just 
We're still not reconstructing them well enough. 
well
And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future, so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay. 
 just 
It's a stretch of beach we know so well. 
well
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island, and he would look out, and then he would say, "Okay, we go." 
okay
Together, may we journey well. 
well
Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease, and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. 
 just 
Well first of all, it's because we can read it, which is fantastic. 
well
You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said. 
 just 
There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. 
 just 
And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage, they pause for just a moment, and they leave something in an enzyme for a second, and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. 
 just 
 So I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful." 
okay
I mean, I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. 
i mean
And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference, if we could do it, and so I said, "Well, let's look at it." 
well
Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. 
 just 
So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. 
 just 
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow, but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. 
 just 
But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. 
 just 
And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do, and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease -- how well it works. 
well
Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know, where did it appear? -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. 
well
And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb, imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing, and the way that we talked about it, we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water." 
i mean
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?" 
well
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water." 
well
"Kitchen water, well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. 
well
So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. 
 just 
So I think eventually, once we have one of these models for people, which we'll get eventually -- I mean, our group won't get all the way there -- but eventually we'll have a very good computer model -- sort of like a global climate model for weather. 
i mean
And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer -- and this also will be for ALS, or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases, things like that -- we will simulate specifically you, not just a generic person, but what's actually going on inside you. 
 just 
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. 
 just 
And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer, and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job. 
 just 
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan. 
 just 
A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us. 
well
And now Libya as you see it. 
you see
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, "Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well." 
well
 Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you. 
 just 
CA: There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. 
 just 
CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community, TEDxCairo, are meeting as we speak. 
well
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can. 
i mean
So I called back and I told her, "Look, Amy, tell the TED guys I just won't show up. 
 just 
I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world -- not always in a good way, but they do. 
i mean
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size. 
 just 
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine. 
i mean
Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees. 
 just 
I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops. 
i mean
I mean, these were the faces of my friends. 
i mean
I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. 
i mean
When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. 
 just 
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can." 
okay
So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. 
 just 
Okay, for example, that's Palestine. 
okay
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project." 
well
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue. 
 just 
Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and, you know what, even easy. 
you know
We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. 
 just 
I just observed. 
 just 
Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears. 
 just 
I just took their pictures and pasted them. 
 just 
When I arrived -- I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO. 
i mean
So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book. 
 just 
And she said, "You know what? 
you know
I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. 
 just 
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, "You know what? 
you know
You see that enough in the media. 
you see
I mean, you should see that. 
i mean
And they would put a number: "Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia." 
you know
We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. 
 just 
I mean, they want to know what you're up to. 
i mean
Art. Just doing art. 
 just 
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, "You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows. 
you know
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside. 
you know
"Oh, that guy just moved." 
 just 
Okay, India. 
okay
Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos -- we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls. 
you know
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. 
 just 
In India it was just impossible to paste. 
 just 
I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting. 
 just 
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?" 
you know
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. 
you know
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. 
 just 
 Okay. 
okay
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" -- its images, photography, taken one after the other. 
you see
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, "Hey, what about my roof?" 
 just 
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. 
 just 
From just an idea that sounded crazy, you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. 
 just 
To just bring them to justice." 
 just 
We have the same problems; we can just go in the streets. 
 just 
Well, this is about state budgets. 
well
Well what are we taking in? 
well
It is an increasingly difficult picture, even assuming the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do. 
well
Well, some really nice little tricks. 
well
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out. 
 just 
It really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations -- health care, where innovation makes it more expensive, early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you, and just generosity -- that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over time, that you've got a problem. 
 just 
Well what's going to give? 
well
Well in order to accommodate that, you would have to cut education spending in half. 
well
Within the education community there's this discussion of, "Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off, or the less good teachers who get laid off?" 
 just 
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think, well maybe you think that's okay. 
well
Well we need money to experiment with that, to get those tools in there. 
well
Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. 
well
Well there really is no brain trust. 
well
We just shot you." 
 just 
You can use, actually, scaffolds, biomaterials -- they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt -- but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. 
well
But if I were to point to three challenges, the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. 
well
But even now, 2011, there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. 
 just 
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here. 
you see
And you see that patient now six months after with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue, when you analyze it under the microscope. 
you see
So you see the leaflets opening and closing -- of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. 
you see
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials. 
 just 
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used. 
you know
You can hold it like a liver, but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver. 
 just 
And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. 
 just 
And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. 
you see
That's what you see here on the right side. 
you see
You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves. 
you see
So we go layer by layer through the organ, analyzing each layer as we go through the organ, and we then are able to send that information, as you see here, through the computer and actually design the organ This actually shows the actual printer. 
you see
That's actually the actual printer right now, and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. 
you see
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. 
you see
LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. 
well
JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. 
well
 My parents were radicals --  who became, well, grown-ups. 
well
My dad facetiously says, "We wanted to save the world, and instead we just got rich." 
 just 
We actually just got "middle class" in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but you get the picture. 
 just 
When I was just a little girl, my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world. 
 just 
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label. 
okay
Many in my generation -- because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education -- were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes --  who were going to go out and save the world. 
well
My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze, her eyes really welled with tears, and she looked right at me and she said, "I will not stand for your desperation." 
well
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. 
well
And it's about loving people really well. 
well
But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started. 
 just 
And I started putting the first YouTube videos up, really just as a kind of nice-to-have, just kind of a supplement for my cousins, something that might give them a refresher or something. 
 just 
And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before, and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room. 
 just 
The other thing that happened is -- I put them on YouTube just -- I saw no reason to make it private, so I let other people watch it, and then people started stumbling on it, and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world. 
 just 
These are just a few. 
 just 
But then, as the viewership kept growing and kept growing, I started getting letters from people, and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice-to-have. 
 just 
This is just an excerpt from one of those letters: "My 12 year-old son has autism, and has had a terrible time with math. 
 just 
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time, and I give you a bicycle for two weeks, then I come back after two weeks, and say, "Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. 
well
This is just another one of the modules. 
 just 
And the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything -- well, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. 
well
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- from this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming, you have grammar, you have genetics, all based off of that core of, if you know this and that, now you're ready for this next concept. 
you know
Now that can work well for an individual learner, and I encourage you to do it with your kids, but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself. 
well
And what the teacher does is literally just say, "Let me intervene on the red kids." 
 just 
When you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak, "differentiated learning" -- but it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom. 
you see
But when you let students work at their own pace -- we see it over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other, but once they get through that concept, they just race ahead. 
you see
It makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time. 
 just 
Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos, our goal is to use technology to humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale, what's happening in education. 
 just 
So once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom, you're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue, by a factor of five or 10. 
 just 
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it. 
 oh 
I have to be clear, it's not just me anymore. 
 just 
I said, "Well, every student would work at their own pace, on something like this, we'd give a dashboard." 
well
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. 
 oh 
BG: Well, it's amazing. 
well
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education. 
 just 
And you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see. 
you know
And they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed, which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses. 
 just 
They enter the queue, they just zip right out. 
 just 
You know we all want to be someone who has watched "Rashomon," but right now we want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time. 
you know
So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us, if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see, then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. 
 just 
 Man: Okay. 
okay
So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. 
well
 So he didn't just learn water. 
 just 
And the implications of this -- there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loops. 
 just 
What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes, again, of just life in the living room. 
 just 
Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes, we turn time into the vertical axis, and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind. 
 just 
And just for contrast, we can do this with any word. 
 just 
This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. 
 just 
And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations, you just tune into publicly available social media feeds. 
 just 
And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family, we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people. 
 just 
So if we go and look at this piece of content, President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago, and look at what we find in this same data set, at the same scale, the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. 
 just 
And so just to return to my son, when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder, and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today, and I asked him for permission -- granted. 
 just 
And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said, "So that when I grow up, I can show this to my kids?" 
 just 
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well. 
well
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story. 
 just 
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana. 
well
So it's not just about the number of people; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. 
 just 
Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here. 
okay
Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana, and it involves beer. 
well
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. 
well
Okay? 
okay
I once -- this was years ago -- I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate. 
well
And so he goes around the room, and then as he's leaving the diner, he first-names almost everybody he's just met. 
 just 
I was like, "Okay, that's social skill." 
okay
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy -- that's fine. 
you see
In one of my books, I joke that Ben &amp; Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste -- doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave. 
 just 
And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life, but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything; I'm just not going to die." 
 just 
You see them on the mountains up there. 
you see
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie, and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. 
by the way
It was just sheer terror. 
 just 
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for. 
well
And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand. 
 just 
 This is a gender-linked trait, by the way. 
by the way
And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group; it's determined by how well they communicate, how often they take turns in conversation. 
well
In the course of that book, he describes a moment -- just months after Carol has died -- he comes across her picture on the mantel, or on a bureau in his bedroom. 
 just 
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience. 
you see
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. 
 just 
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. 
 just 
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before? 
i mean
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever. 
i mean
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history? 
 just 
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us? 
 just 
Well, that was not by me. 
well
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness. 
well
And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier. 
 just 
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows. 
 just 
The sun is for beauty in our environment, like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta, which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers, who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space, responding to what the sun does outside, just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof. 
 just 
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative as well as qualitative methods, to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture. 
well
It can be just like this, or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar, but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States. 
 just 
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group. 
well
Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did for General Motors, And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle. 
 just 
And then finally, Kelly's play of brilliants added to that really some play, I think, of the skyline of Hong Kong, or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house, or in the theater here, which is the decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful, something that is just an addition to the architectural environment, I would say. 
 just 
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left, was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe. 
i guess
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design. 
you see
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground. 
you see
It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps. 
 just 
Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is. 
you see
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think, and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind. 
well
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it, and they said, "Well, we can do something." 
well
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger. 
 just 
So just to explain. 
 just 
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works. 
 just 
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being. 
well
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes? 
 just 
This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. 
well
And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face, wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. 
 just 
You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house, so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. 
 just 
Okay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix. 
okay
 All right, so I want you to take a moment, and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true. 
you know
Okay, ready? Go. 
okay
Okay. 
okay
Okay, so these are three things I know to be true. 
okay
I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person. 
 just 
She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand, but instead she just nodded at me and said, "Hey, I really felt that. Thanks." 
 just 
The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home, and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. 
well
It's not just the adage "Write what you know." 
you know
We stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled, performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates, from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus. 
 just 
And most people respond really well to this exercise. 
well
"Miss," she'd say, "I'm just not interesting. 
 just 
 "Did you see him on 60 Minutes, racing Michael Phelps in a pool -- nothing but swim trunks on -- diving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion? 
you see
And yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt, but it also means that when beautiful, amazing things just fall out of the sky, I'm ready to catch them. 
 just 
It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself. 
 just 
And me? Well, neither do I, but I see the impossible every day. 
well
Impossible is trying to connect in this world, trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you, knowing that while you're speaking, they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk -- they hear you. 
 just 
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around. 
 just 
But this is just one, two, three billion people, and obviously there are seven billion people in the world, so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line. 
 just 
Look here, you see the seven billion people up there: the air people, the wash people, the bulb people and the fire people. 
you see
What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends, without any real advanced analysis, to 2050, there are two things that can increase the energy use. 
 just 
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change. 
well
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene, and put it into mammal cells. 
well
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. 
you see
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral, while this is from jellyfish. 
by the way
The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. 
 just 
It's not just insects. 
 just 
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room. 
you see
And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. 
 just 
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip. 
 just 
This is a DNA synthesizer, and here at the bottom are just bottles of A, T, C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain. 
 just 
Is everything okay? 
okay
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want? 
okay
Do we get to create organic robots, where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings? 
 just 
   Pep Rosenfeld: Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden. 
 just 
And the thing about this piece that's so special -- if you see it behind me -- it's not notated in any way. 
you see
You see there are different lines. 
you see
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet. 
well
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal. 
well
Okay. 
okay
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth. 
 just 
Well, I don't think so. 
well
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic. 
by the way
Now you might think, you and me, "Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," to so many millions of poor people. 
okay
Okay. 
okay
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. 
well
Okay, we'll do something with it. 
okay
AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. 
well
BJ: Okay so. 
okay
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe. 
 just 
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure. 
you see
AK: The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism, just a bit bigger. 
 just 
And just around that time, his mother had said, "Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'?" 
you see
I'd just like to describe -- I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. 
 just 
You see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up. 
you see
You see the skeletal structure of it. 
you see
And now just --  All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. 
 just 
   So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. 
you see
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 
 just 
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. 
 just 
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people? 
you know
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls." 
 just 
And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything. 
 just 
Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, "You have got to see this." 
well
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know. 
you know
I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it. 
 just 
I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. 
 just 
 Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. 
 just 
And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries. 
 just 
And I've just chosen a few of them here. 
 just 
"Aside from the beautiful music, it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before, but who are connected anyway." 
 just 
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious. 
 just 
You see that really salty Play-Doh? 
you see
Well, it conducts electricity. 
well
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. 
well
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. 
well
Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. 
well
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed, your shoulders are crushed down, and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well. 
well
The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door. 
 just 
And I realized that, if they came out of combat, it would be because we led them well. 
well
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately. 
i mean
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat, I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can, not just for communication, but for leadership. 
 just 
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. 
 just 
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing. 
 just 
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007, and an old friend of mine, that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note, just in an envelope, that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot, that you would come, if alive." 
 just 
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. 
well
And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger. 
 just 
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big. 
 just 
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. 
 just 
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. 
 just 
I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. 
 just 
Do you know what I wanted to be? 
you know
Because they were all about being free, the wind in your hair -- just to be free. 
 just 
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. 
 just 
And on my seventeenth birthday, after my fake eye exam, the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday. 
 just 
And then there was a silence -- when you know something's wrong. 
you know
And you know, how on earth did I get to 17 and not know that? 
you know
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful, let me tell you this: I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song, "A Boy Named Sue." 
well
So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this? 
 just 
The really strange part is that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school, my parents made a bizarre, unusual and incredibly brave decision. 
 just 
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue, a boy given a girl's name, I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive, when they were no longer there to protect me, or just take it all away. 
 just 
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it -- aside from the fact that I thought he was insane -- I got that thump in my chest, just that "huh?" 
 just 
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated. 
you know
But can I just tell you, the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. 
 just 
And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not, or to be somebody that you aren't? 
you know
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm, they put a chip in your head, and you're like, "I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. 
you know
I just was so -- how do I tell him? 
 just 
And that silence just outside a doctor's office, that many of us know. 
 just 
And I went on a run that I know so well. 
well
I know this run so well, by the back of my hand. 
well
And you know, the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers. 
you know
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'? 
well
And the moment, and I mean the moment, the moment that hit me, I swear to God, it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in. 
you know
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot. 
 just 
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home. 
 oh 
 The most powerful thing of all, it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did. 
 oh 
But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing. 
you know
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not? 
you know
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you, it's extraordinary what happens. 
you know
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers, it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations. 
you know
When I came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was? 
you know
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way -- no charity, no pity. 
you see
It just seemed that it was possible. 
 just 
And you know, the oddest part is, when I was on my way traveling here to TED, I'll be honest, I was petrified. 
you know
 And I have learned, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom. 
you know
And if you truly believe -- and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen. 
i mean
But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. 
 just 
Well, the answer seems to be, the universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty. 
well
In pockets, there appear what my colleague, Fred Spier, calls "Goldilocks conditions" -- not too hot, not too cold, just right for the creation of complexity. 
 just 
And at first, it's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. 
 just 
Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background. 
 just 
What you see here, the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas. 
you see
Well, first, you need energy, but not too much. 
well
In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again. 
 just 
What you want is just the right amount, and planets, it turns out, are just right, because they're close to stars, but not too close. 
 just 
Well, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. 
well
Well, planets are great, and our early Earth was almost perfect. 
well
But of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry. 
 just 
Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick. 
well
We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa, but then you see humans migrating into new environments, into desert lands, into jungles, into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia -- tough, tough environment -- into the Americas, into Australasia. 
you see
I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends and his generation, throughout the world, to know the story of big history, and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us. 
well
How often do we hear that people just don't care? 
 just 
And I'll give you some examples of what I mean. 
i mean
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it, maybe you want to go to the restaurant. 
 just 
It talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns, no information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are. 
well
Political parties: oh boy. 
 oh 
I am the daughter of a forger, not just any forger ... 
 just 
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. 
well
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?" 
you see
Well, they were out, but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers. 
well
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks? 
you know
This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 -- since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life. 
 just 
If he had accepted payment, he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no" depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause. 
 just 
Then as time passed, at the end of almost two years, they thought, "Well, perhaps our father has died." 
well
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968. 
 just 
But, he agreed to do it, even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger, just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities, and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders -- and that ideas have no borders. 
 just 
And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed. 
well
But I decided then to just give it a try. 
 just 
The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved -- movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me --  and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. 
well
And because of it, as well as I ever could. 
well
When you see me today, I look like the Phantom of the Opera. 
you see
Believe me, he didn't mean this as -- anyway, let me just read it. 
 just 
All of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get. 
you see
I am writing as well as ever. 
well
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman, then that's the voice I want. 
well
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. 
i guess
I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. 
 just 
So I did just that. 
 just 
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. 
 just 
We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. 
 just 
The truth is, there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. 
 just 
Now just about that time, the practice of surgery evolved from big to small, from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures, tiny incisions. 
 just 
Indeed, we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. 
well
I mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. 
i mean
And just imagine what you would feel. 
 just 
Because you know why they're here, and you know what they're doing here. 
you know
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear. 
 just 
Okay, so that's the warm up. 
okay
But really, you just want a better life for yourself. 
 just 
It's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that. 
you know
And you know why they have a design? 
you know
You know why they have their eyes set on it? 
you know
And back home, what do you see? 
you see
This is what you see. 
you see
You see people struggling to get by. 
you see
I mean, it's not easy; you see a lot of poverty. 
you see
These people have designs for your resource, and this is what you see? 
you see
Something else you see that you talk about -- Americans don't talk about this, but you do. 
you see
And you feel it; you see it every day. 
you see
And what you see, something else, the United States, the hub of democracy around the world, they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world. 
you see
There's something else about them that you see -- they don't see themselves. 
you see
And what do you see? They're Christians. 
you see
And their leaders, their leaders: before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off, they go to a Christian church, and they pray to their Christian God, and they ask for protection and guidance from that god. 
you know
Well, obviously, when people die in the war, they are Muslims, they are Iraqis -- they're not Americans. 
well
I mean, here's a guy who says that your God is a false God. 
i mean
The solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him, is to convert you all to Christianity -- just get rid of your religion. 
 just 
And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy. 
you know
I mean this is serious. You're afraid. 
i mean
Man, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade. 
 just 
You know what it means. 
you know
And this man, Terry Jones: I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Korans, right? 
i mean
I mean, of course, this is how Americans take it, so people all over the Middle East, not just in your country, are protesting. 
 just 
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts. How would they do this to their little kids?" 
i mean
So these guys, you see them. 
you see
You see, I, Sam Richards, I know who these guys are. 
you see
When you see them, they're something else, they're something else. 
you see
We're not just there for oil; we're there for lots of reasons. 
 just 
Okay, so now, here's what we're going to do. 
okay
So everyone's back in the room, okay. 
okay
Okay, try this. Bring it back. 
okay
Okay, now follow me on this, because I'm taking a big risk here. 
okay
Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks? 
 just 
You just -- oh, man. 
 just 
You see, that's empathy. 
you see
Now, you might ask, "Okay, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing? 
okay
You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. 
 just 
And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take. 
you know
 And I'm like, "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them." 
you know
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about. 
 just 
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine. 
okay
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great. 
okay
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake. 
i mean
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything. 
 just 
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air. 
 just 
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground. 
you know
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural. 
well
This is not mine, by the way. 
by the way
 So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. 
you know
We learn these really bad lessons really well. 
well
And a lot of us -- and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers. 
 just 
Okay, so fine. 
okay
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. 
 just 
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy. 
well
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. 
 just 
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant. 
 just 
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. 
 just 
I just imagined it everywhere," But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show. 
 just 
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this. 
you know
 I mean, this is life. 
i mean
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements? 
you know
I called my wife Leslie, and I said, "You know, there's so many good people trying to do so much good. 
you know
I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. 
 just 
And she told me, she said, "You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia, in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia, and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen. 
you know
And I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses -- and I said to my father, "Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment." 
 just 
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find." 
well
And I was so shocked, so stunned, I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?" 
well
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare. 
you know
 You know that teacher? 
you know
It started out like this: it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school, 1978. 
 just 
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. 
 just 
So I thought, well they like to play games. 
well
I'm just a clock watcher. 
 just 
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. 
 just 
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever So I'll just share with you ... 
 just 
And so I apologize to them as well. 
well
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see. 
well
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. 
 just 
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room. 
 just 
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time. 
i mean
So I'll just share a third story. 
 just 
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room. 
 just 
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. 
 just 
So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe, at this point in our exploration of it, is unknown or not well understood. 
well
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard. 
well
And the line of black dots that you see in the background, that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. 
you see
And just to give you an idea, they have spent 20 million over 20 years. 
 just 
Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium. 
you see
 Radio: Okay, release the balloon, release the balloon, release the balloon. 
okay
A lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security, and I think that's really important. 
 just 
They're just part of being alive; we all do it. 
 just 
I mean, the joke "One, Two, Three, Many" is kind of right. 
i mean
Or two, you can make people just feel secure and hope they don't notice. 
 just 
But if you know stuff, you're more likely to have your feelings match reality. 
you know
Okay, so what makes people not notice? 
okay
Well, a poor understanding. 
well
This is why you keep sacrificing virgins, and why your unicorn defenses are working just great. 
 just 
I mean, there were people who were afraid to push doorbells, because there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous. 
i mean
Intuitive is just another word for familiar. 
 just 
And you see agenda -- this is marketing, this is politics -- trying to convince you to have one model versus another, trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings, marginalizing people with models you don't like. 
you see
But 80 years, we're just not good at. 
 just 
I mean, this works as long as it's to correct others. 
i mean
And that's okay. 
okay
I mean really though, information seems like our best hope. 
i mean
I said, "Well, that's kind of neat. 
well
It's not just reality; it's feeling and reality. 
 just 
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it. 
well
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward. 
well
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up. 
 just 
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. 
you see
And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. 
 just 
But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is. 
 just 
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad. 
 just 
But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy. 
you know
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement. 
well
Well I took one year. 
well
It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats. 
 just 
So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. 
 just 
If you have three of them, and you loop them together, well you make a triangle. 
well
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle. 
 just 
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash. 
 just 
You just need a ton. 
 just 
Well since then, I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over 2,000 schools in my country -- village schools, government schools, municipal schools, Ivy League schools -- I've been invited by most of them. 
well
Well we make lots and lots of pumps. 
well
And this is the other one -- that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts. 
 just 
Now this is what you do, is you bend both these legs into a triangle, and you just wrap some tape around. 
 just 
 Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh, you would make this with the palmyra leaf. 
well
In three minutes, you just fold this up. 
 just 
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination. 
 just 
If you want to put a colored disk, well all these seven colors coalesce. 
well
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back, that white light's made of seven colors, just by spinning this around. 
 just 
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape, nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner, so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here. 
 just 
I just put this inside this. 
 just 
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years, they just muck up the definition and they spit it out. 
 just 
And we're just trying to see possibilities. 
 just 
Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron. 
 just 
So something which is trash, which is choking all the seabirds, you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous -- all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. 
 just 
This is a little straw, and what you do is you just nip two corners here, and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth. 
 just 
Well before I go any further, this is something worth sharing. 
well
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this. 
 just 
Well, this is, again, it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts. 
well
And what you can do is just, if you give it a twirl, well they just keep going on. 
well
And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on. 
 just 
Well in the end, what we can also do: we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps. 
well
It's a great cricket cap.   When first you see Nehru and Gandhi, this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper. 
you see
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story. 
well
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap. 
 um
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord. 
 just 
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap. 
 just 
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me. 
 just 
So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good. 
well
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside. 
 just 
You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow. 
 just 
Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air. 
 just 
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me. 
i guess
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one, and a really short one at that. 
 just 
And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape." 
 just 
So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow? 
i guess
 Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.  This is one of the jackets you grew? 
 just 
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it. 
okay
And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky, and you just keep the shutter open, as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope, it will see something like this. 
 just 
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out." 
well
And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice, so that macroscopically it looks the same. 
 just 
This insight that entropy increases, by the way, is what's behind what we call the arrow of time, the difference between the past and the future. 
by the way
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away, the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever. 
 just 
Well what is the implication of that? 
well
He said, well, entropy increases because there are many, many more ways for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy. 
well
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton -- they were absolute; they just stuck there forever. 
 just 
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules. 
 just 
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough, the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. 
you know
Well if that's true, Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle. 
well
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. 
 just 
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie, you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie. 
 just 
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation, all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before, we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at -- high entropy. 
 just 
If our order were due to a fluctuation, we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. 
 just 
I just showed you this picture. 
 just 
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living," but that's not right. 
well
Either it's just like that. There is no explanation. 
 just 
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. 
 just 
You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. 
you know
Well, their answer was, "It's all about risk and reward." 
well
"Well, in order to reproduce." 
well
"Well, why?" 
well
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex." 
well
I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever." 
 just 
I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. 
 just 
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. 
 just

After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. 
 just 
And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. 
 just 
I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. 
 just 
This is just the food chain unfolding. 
 just 
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. 
 just 
And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. 
 just 
But I just started to shoot these pictures. 
 just 
I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. 
 just 
This just didn't happen a couple of times. 
 just 
 Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. 
 just 
And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. 
 just 
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent. 
you see
The components of this material are just water and protein. 
 just 
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber. 
you see
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface, which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. 
 just 
So as you see the film go in transparently through there, and then ... 
you see
What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size. 
you see
And the gears work in water as well. 
well
So there's versatility, as you see, in the material formats, that you can do with silk. 
you see
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real? 
i mean
And you see here a picture of a tissue section. 
you see
And what you see there in that tissue section, in fact, is you see that reflector tape. 
you see
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue. 
you see
And so what you see there is the difference. 
you see
I started my journey in California, with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook, and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life. 
well
By measuring the students' smiles, researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be,  how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being, and how inspiring she would be to others. 
well
Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match. 
well
So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress or improve your marriage, or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost, or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages, or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, 
 just 
And what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case -- I can't speak for anybody else -- but in my case, a lot of room for another big ego. 
i mean
Well, not as big as his, but fairly big. 
well
But when he didn't win, when he lost, he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. 
 just 
And without skipping a beat at all, he said, "Well, they'd be about the same. 
well
 Well, I happened to have been very quick that day, and I said, "Yeah, but a lot less baloney." 
well
Well, what do you talk about when you talk about minds? 
well
He wasn't feeling too well, so he left a little bit early. 
well
I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman, even when he did what he did. 
 just 
And I said, "Well, my real hero was my father. 
well
And Feynman's eyes just opened up. 
 just 
And for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. 
well
And it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well. 
well
They had their super-powerful technique, and they couldn't do as well. 
well
But you couldn't; they were just too complicated. 
 just 
What do you see? 
you see
You see a frozen bunch of partons. 
you see
You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons. 
 just 
I suppose it is, so I won't say revolution -- but it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton, and of particles beyond that. 
i suppose
Well, I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman, what he was like, but I see I have exactly half a minute. 
well
So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event. 
 just 
As just a second example: these pyramidal cells, large cells, they can span a significant fraction of the brain. 
 just 
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel. 
 just 
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix. 
well
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature, which are able to convert light into electricity. 
well
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. 
 just 
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot, and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery. 
 just 
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell, like putting solar panels on a roof, and the next thing you know, you have a neuron which can be activated with light. 
you know
And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others. 
 just 
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. 
 just 
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated. 
 just 
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network, just these cells are going to be driven. 
 just 
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do, what their power is in computing in the brain, but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells, if indeed they're atrophied. 
well
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later. 
 just 
Okay, there it goes. Right now. 
okay
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment, that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory. 
 just 
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds, you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded. 
 just 
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time, until the seizure dies away, and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -- sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state. 
 just 
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light, and we beam light in, and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure, we're hoping to be able to turn it off. 
 just 
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras. 
 just 
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. 
you see
It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there. 
 just 
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive. 
 just 
And to point out the power of this: these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives. 
 just 
EB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard. 
well
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you.   
well
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way, in her bead shop in London. 
by the way
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work, a few projects that we've worked on. 
 just 
And just very quickly, something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again. 
 just 
And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop, you're just a prisoner. 
 just 
And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken. 
 just 
It's just steel and timber. 
 just 
 And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station, our condition was that we would work with them and that, whatever we did, we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. 
 just 
That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work. 
 just 
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter, create one composition. 
 just 
So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in, and using the spare soil that's there on the site, we could make a power station that was silent as well. 
well
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference. 
 just 
The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station. 
 just 
In Shanghai, we were invited to build -- well we weren't invited; what am I talking about. 
well
But you just have to go to a garden center, and they're in little paper packets. 
 just 
By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations. 
by the way
Song: ♫ We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫ ♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫ ♫ They're the Mop Tops ♫ Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea. 
 just 
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini-me version of the seed cathedral, so that, even if you're partially-sighted, that it was kind of crunchy and soft, that piece of landscape that you see there. 
you see
And then, you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur -- in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral, in effect, we've shaved it. 
you know
There's just silence and a cool temperature. 
 just 
I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. 
i mean
And I just wanted to show you. 
 just 
And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower, and you squeeze a few trees around the edge, and you see cars parked. 
you see
It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience, and the rest of it is just for postcards. 
 just 
They're just chopped at different heights. 
 just 
And so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed. 
 just 
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph. 
you see
The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. 
 just 
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. 
well
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. 
 just 
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord -- with other adjacent cells. 
 just 
Well, what do we do about that? 
well
But just to try to prove that fact to you, I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. 
 just 
Okay. 
okay
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators. 
well
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away. 
 just 
For example, this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud. 
 just 
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing. 
 just 
So if you brush up against it, any place you brushed against it, you get this twinkling blue-green light that's just breathtaking. 
 just 
And you see things like this. 
you see
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing. 
 just 
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents, as you see here. 
you see
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock, it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume, changing color as it goes, from green to blue. 
 just 
And like the one you just saw, it can produce these as bands of light. 
 just 
 So there's a language of light in the deep ocean, and we're just beginning to understand it, and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays. 
 just 
It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. 
 just 
So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea. 
 just 
And when it starts flashing, it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast. 
 just 
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data. 
 just 
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam, and it's going to be this pinwheel display. 
okay
So we are starting to get a handle on this, but only just the beginnings. 
 just 
As you see, everything starts to fade to black, and you see people going to sleep. 
you see
Followed by that, you see on the West coast planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast. 
you see
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner. 
you see
Moving across to the West coast, you see San Francisco and Los Angeles -- big low-traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona. 
you see
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters, because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data. 
well
And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well, except for one thing: it's not a robot at all. 
well
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on, and we're just doing these little labors? 
 just 
And juxtaposed against this grid, you see actually, by rolling over each individual one, the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. 
you see
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame, and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they're doing. 
you see
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. 
well
You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings, like this one on top -- spent a long time making realistic versions. 
you see
Here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?" 
you see
We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. 
well
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers, but we also open sourced it, and we made it released as a Google Code project, where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. 
 just 
As you know, an animation is a series of images. 
you know
And I just thought it'd be wonderful, it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. 
 just 
And I just worked and worked through problems, until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. 
 just 
And in a weird way, that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. 
well
But to get us started, I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world. 
 just 
Even here in California, if we were to go back just a few years, it was a very different story. 
 just 
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this:  Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active? 
 just 
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. 
 just 
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults. 
well
It's just happening in another part of the world. 
 just 
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases, because this disease is like a root fire; it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely. 
 just 
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world. 
 just 
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you. 
 just 
It's just two drops, like that. 
 just 
Within a couple of years, every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses, with the exception of four countries that you see here. 
you see
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. 
 just 
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. 
well
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to. 
 just 
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. 
 um
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days, but it's not true. 
 um
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world. 
 just 
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. 
well
So this morning at about seven o'clock, I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again, so that you could see something that's just unfolding today, which proves that the impossible is possible. 
 just 
Sanitation is terrible, and our old vaccine, you remember, worked half as well as it should have. 
well
In Umar's home country of Nigeria, a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. 
 um
 Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be? 
well
But the interesting thing is, of those three, India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data. 
 just 
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down. 
 just 
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out, and the governments will keep their generosity up. 
well
Well, it has its pluses and minuses. 
well
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years. 
you see
That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution. 
you see
And actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon. 
 just 
But in the non-Muslim communities of the Middle East, such as some Christian communities, Eastern communities, you see the same practice. 
you see
We had a tragic case of an honor killing within Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago. 
 just 
But when I realized that the non-Muslim, or the non-Islamic-minded actors in the same geography, sometimes behaved similarly, I realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region, not just Islam. 
 just 
But when I saw that, I said, "Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region, and some Muslims have been influenced by that. 
 just 
I said, "Well I will make a research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today, and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken." 
well
Which means that Muslims can, today, look at those things and say, "Well, the core of our religion is here to stay with us. 
well
But not just that; also democracy, parliament, the idea of representation, the idea of equal citizenship. 
 just 
That trend is generally called Islamic modernism, and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen, not just as an intellectual idea though, but also as a political program. 
 just 
And in my book, I went into that question as well. 
well
You just look at the political history of the 20th century, and you see things have changed a lot. 
you see
So Europe is not just an example now to emulate; it's an enemy to fight and to resist. 
 just 
in liberal ideas in the Muslim world, and what you see is more of a defensive, rigid, reactionary strain, which led to Arab socialism, Arab nationalism and ultimately to the Islamist ideology. 
you see
Well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming -- but that's another discussion. 
well
You must have all seen the Arab Spring, And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators. 
 just 
They just should be allowed to work for that. 
 just 
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right? 
 just 
So just a month ago, on January 29th, we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event. 
 just 
Well there comes the first box. 
well
Well this is what it's all about, this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity. 
well
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning. 
 just 
I spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness -- trying to see if I can actually train my mind in a particular way, like I can train my body, so I can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-being. 
well
Then this January, my mother died, and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me. 
 just 
That if you live in the best climate, in San Diego in the United States, or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York, you are going to be just as happy in either place. 
 just 
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S., any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny, tiny influence on your overall well-being. 
well
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier than if you are single. 
well
If you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called George, when he decides on where he wants to live -- is it Florida or North Dakota? -- he goes and lives in Georgia. 
you see
 Now I, of course, thought, "Well this is American data," and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans. 
well
This is just completely ridiculous." 
 just 
Quite consciously, design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques, just basically to fight straightforward adaptation. 
 just 
Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well, like this little business card for an animation company called Sideshow on lenticular foils. 
well
It just came out six months ago, and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany. 
 just 
What can we do with just one person's data? 
 just 
We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it." 
 just 
I think about World War II -- some of our great technologists then, some of our great physicists, studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff. 
 just 
You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. 
 just 
 Okay, last question -- harder question -- when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case, should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework, or should we use a Millian consequentialist one? 
okay
Maybe we just follow our gut. 
 just 
I'm just going back and forth; I'm not getting anywhere. 
 just 
What if there are truths about justice, and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated, partook of that form of justice? 
 just 
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. 
 just 
It wouldn't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances. 
 just 
I mean, think about that. How grand. How ambitious. 
i mean
If you don't think that way, well, you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy, because the tidy idea, you know, people criticized it. 
well
How about this: What if in any situation you could just calculate, look at the choices, measure out which one's better and know what to do? 
 just 
What if morals, what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain? 
 just 
It's just a matter of the consequences. 
 just 
Not just because it rang earlier, but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation. 
 just 
It's wrong to take his phone because he's a person and he has rights and he has dignity, and we can't just interfere with that. 
 just 
You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine. 
 just 
What you just did, that's the first step towards taking responsibility Now the next step -- try this. 
 just 
And don't just find another technologist friend; find somebody different than you. 
 just 
Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking. 
well
♫ Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum ♫ Well, your musician friend will stop you and say, "You know, the theme music for your data revolution, that's an opera, that's Wagner. 
well
Then I just pick things up. 
 just 
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. 
 just 
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around. 
 just 
 But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton. 
i guess
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park." 
i mean
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur. 
i guess
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things. 
 just 
And so she thought, well, what the heck. 
well
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. 
well
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. 
well
I mean, it was wonderful stuff. 
i mean
So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast. 
 just 
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park." 
 just 
I mean it really is. 
i mean
I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification. 
i mean
I guess we could make a glow chicken. 
i guess
He's looking for those genes as well. 
well
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders." 
well
But it's just the very basics. 
 just 
Well, that's a good question. 
well
He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for five years. 
 just 
The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in ages. 
 just 
And yet, despite everything going really well for John, he was struggling, fighting addiction and a gripping depression. 
well
I know John's story very well because I'm John. 
well
And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you, to urge you, that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide, or you know somebody who has, talk about it; get help. 
you know
Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking. 
well
But if you think about it, if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day -- two, four, eight, 16 -- in 15 days you have 32,000. 
 just 
And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care, and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today, ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population, the way we really don't use information very well today, the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course 
well
What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health, leveraging technology as well? 
well
I mean this is the iPhone 4. 
i mean
Well it's no secret that computers, through Moore's law, are speeding up faster and faster. 
well
Well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy. 
well
Compare those two pictures, and now as a radiologist, you can essentially fly through your patient's colon and, augmenting that with artificial intelligence, identify potentially, as you see here, a lesion. 
you see
But now that we're switching to merging medical data, making it available electronically, we can crowd source that information, and now as a physician, I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device. 
 just 
And just last month the first FDA-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices. 
 just 
And as you saw just about a month ago, Watson from IBM beat the two champions in "Jeopardy." 
 just 
We're now in the era of virtual visits -- from sort of the Skype-type visits you can do with American Well, to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system. 
well
And as we start to integrate this information, we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies, health and wellness. 
well
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on -- it won't say "check engine" though. 
 just 
So again, it's not just genes, it's multiple details -- our habits, our environmental exposure. 
 just 
Well we're now entering the era of systems medicine, or systems biology, where we can start to integrate all of this information. 
well
Geron, just last year, started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. 
 just 
Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow, instead of with 200 punctures, with just a single puncture under local anesthesia. 
 just 
And I think by pulling these things together, if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these, we're going to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick. 
well
Now before you get up in arms, or you break into song, or you pick a favorite color, I want to define what I mean by revolution. 
i mean
By revolution, I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave. 
i mean
We need a revolution because things aren't working; they're just not working. 
 just 
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential. 
you know
We're last place in health care, and that's important for a sense of well-being. 
well
And there we are, not just last in the E.U., we're last in Europe, at the very bottom. 
 just 
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. 
 just 
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?" 
well
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away. 
 just 
Well I'm going to say no. 
well
And you know what? 
you know
And it's not just kids, it's adults too. 
 just 
We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around. 
 just 
Little exercise just for a second: close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play. 
 just 
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious, play doesn't mean frivolous. 
 just 
You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing, he's serious about it, but he loves it. 
you know
Through promoting fun and a great environment, and, in just three short years -- sounds like a long time, but change is slow -- every customer, from zero to every customer referring us, above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders. 
 just 
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?" 
well
Well we did win, every year that we entered, one of the rankings for best employer for small business. 
well
If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something. 
well
You know what, let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid. 
you know
But the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking. 
 just 
Well in case you've ever wondered, this is what the Sun sounds like. 
well
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy. 
well
And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth, we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques. 
 just 
Jansky had made a historic discovery, that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves. 
well
It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away. 
 just 
If I'm violent with you and you respond with violence, you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence. 
 just 
They just have to raise their hands. 
 just 
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them. 
well
Well obviously this is a replica. 
well
Well no, not pieces of plastic, but stone seals, copper tablets, pottery and, surprisingly, one large sign board, which was found buried near the gate of a city. 
well
So you see up there one such object. 
you see
Well let me show you. 
well
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes? 
you know
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle; it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. 
 just 
I don't mean the software; I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text. 
i mean
Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world. 
well
Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay. 
okay
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay. 
okay
But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters. 
 just 
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages. 
well
It's just like our English and Dutch example. 
 just 
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley. 
you see
Okay. Great. 
okay
So this is just like a crossword puzzle, except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it. 
 just 
In Dravidian languages, the word for fish is "meen" which happens to sound just like the word for star. 
 just 
Well not yet. 
well
The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis; it belongs to all of us. 
 just 
Well, that first cutaway picture worked, so we said, "Okay, let's do some more." 
well
This shaped wok doesn't work very well; this caught fire three times. 
well
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away, so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan. 
well
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible, and you try to make the highest quality hamburger, The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer." Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe, if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff, it does take about 30 hours. 
 just 
So you photograph that in exactly the same position, and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges. 
 just 
Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue. 
 just 
You know, there's two ways you can make a product. 
you know
You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want, or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it. 
 just 
As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray, and you just take it off in little passes, build it up, slice it vertically. 
 just 
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI, I thought, well, let's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin. 
well
Well, if you have a high-speed camera, and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around, pretty soon somebody does this. 
well
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are? 
you know
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance. 
 just 
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this." 
i guess
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like. 
i mean
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive. 
 just 
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom. 
 just 
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card. 
 just 
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles. 
you see
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast. 
i mean
And blowflies just can't help themselves. 
 just 
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature. 
you know
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well. 
well
Well yes we can. 
well
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that. 
 just 
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. 
 just 
These are just some examples. 
 just 
All of this is leading -- computer addiction, just to cover that: the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices. 
 just 
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q. 
 just 
And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79, which is just below average. 
 just 
Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes. 
 just 
And I'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed. 
 just 
 Lakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second. 
 just 
 You know, when I heard Simon's -- please sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second -- when I read his book, I went to LA to meet him. 
you know
Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about -- Well this is it. This is the control unit. 
well
What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here. 
well
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984. 
well
As Wael Ghonim, the Google-Egyptian-executive by day, secret-Facebook-activist by night, famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down, "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet." 
 just 
In fact, on Twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "Well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy. 
well
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites. 
well
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do. 
 just 
Similarly, governments don't enact just because politicians wake up one day. 
 just 
Eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules. 
well
Well my personal story, my personal journey, what brings me to the TED stage here today, is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in Muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond. 
well
Now this is not all necessarily good news, because it's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love. 
 just 
I was, by the way -- I'm an Essex lad, born and raised in Essex in the U.K. 
by the way
Now that journey, and what took me from Essex all the way across the world -- by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists. 
by the way
And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this. 
 just 
Well I believe they're getting left far behind. 
well
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this. 
well
What I mean by that is, if the world superpower today was a communist, it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism, than it is today with the world superpower being America, occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals. 
i mean
Is it just about grievances? 
 just 
Is it just about a lack of education? 
 just 
Well statistically, the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated. 
well
Anecdotally, we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor, well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia. 
well
And what's needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture -- which is necessarily more than just elections. 
 just 
What we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here -- the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy, not for a democracy. 
you see
Well, Egypt is a good starting point. 
well
And the aspiration that we have at the moment -- as young Arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism -- is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that. 
 just 
The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin. 
well
They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun. 
 just 
And after just a few days, it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness, marmite is the cure. 
 just 
Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent -- in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent -- and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world. 
by the way
And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about, the world is simply far too complex Well let me give you an example. 
well
You know Hans: the Mick Jagger of TED. 
you know
I mean, have a look at this graph. 
i mean
And I'm just counting toasters here. 
 just 
And just a piece of context -- the societies in which our brains evolved had about 300 products and services. 
 just 
And it's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error. 
 just 
You see how this works, right? 
you see
And the moment you step back from the God complex -- let's just try to have a bunch of stuff; let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not -- you can solve your problem. 
 just 
Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months, and people sometimes say to me, "Well Tim, it's kind of obvious. 
well
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?" 
 just 
So I say, okay, fine. 
okay
And after the trial had been running for a little while, he gathered together all his colleagues around his table, and he said, "Well, gentlemen, we have some preliminary results. 
well
And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen, because when I gave you the table of results, I swapped the two columns around. 
well
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here. 
well
And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay. 
 just 
The solidarity just demanding the one thing. 
 just 
NA: Well, let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl. 
well
PM: I don't think so.  NA: But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society. 
 just 
It was very hard, you know, to impose my authority. 
you know
 PM: And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper. 
well
So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you? 
well
NA: As you know, the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered, veiled women. 
you know
So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil, and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it. 
 just 
Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with -- how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? -- and so on; it's just a movement. 
 just 
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married, you can still be a mother, and you can still be respected within the society, but at the same time, that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd. 
 just 
NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years, has been through so much. 
well
And I just wanted to share with you: there's one reporter that came. 
 just 
I'm just not in touch. 
 just 
And certainly, when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger, often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding, how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular, in your country? 
you see
NA: Well there is a saying that says, "You fear what you don't know, and you hate what you fear." 
well
And you cannot do parachute reporting -- just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and a story. 
 just 
 PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen. 
 just 
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like. 
 just 
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there. 
 just 
So let me just run some viruses on my computer. 
 just 
You know that you're infected because it actually shows up. 
you know
So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere. 
 just 
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day. 
 just 
And if we just scroll around, it's just massive. 
 just 
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses. 
well
Well there's multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or keyloggers. 
well
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information. 
 just 
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it. 
 just 
I mean, the Internet is international. 
i mean
And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. 
 just 
So you just can't shut these guys down. 
 just 
You just have to believe me, it is, it is. 
 just 
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted. 
well
But just keep staring at it. 
 just 
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia. 
well
Well in most cases it never gets this far. 
well
When I first heard this theme, I thought, well, embracing otherness is embracing myself. 
well
You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate? 
you know
Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. 
well
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one, and I said, "Skin color." 
well
On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. 
 just 
We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other -- billions of each other. 
 just 
So what you see, that precipice, that high precipice with the valley, is the 2008 financial crisis. 
you see
But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth, and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math, but math in general. 
 just 
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth." 
well
And so -- this is an over-simplification -- but basically, it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through 156 tons of steel in the sky. 
 just 
It's not just going to disappear. 
 just 
But if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. 
well
And he said, "Well, financial services." 
well
And he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now, and I'm one of them." 
well
You just tip your hand. 
 just 
What could go wrong is that a year ago, nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes, and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45. 
 just 
All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said, "Stop." 
 just 
And the gag is that, of course, these aren't just running through the market. 
 just 
And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street. 
you see
And when you see this kind of behavior, what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict, algorithms locked in loops with each other, without any human oversight, without any adult supervision to say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty." 
you see
Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood, and they have "story algorithms" -- a company called Epagogix. 
well
And what you see here, or what you don't really see normally, is that these are the physics of culture. 
you see
And if these algorithms, like the algorithms on Wall Street, just crashed one day and went awry, how would we know? 
 just 
And you see why. You see why. 
you see
All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says, "Stop." 
 just 
So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -- throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -- all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. 
 just 
This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse -- just for these algorithms, just for the Carnival and the Knife. 
 just 
This is just theoretical. 
 just 
Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year, you drown everything. 
well
Well guess what? It didn't. 
well
And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today, that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, assures us that we are in the "decisive year." 
well
Well the answer, of course, is, if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country, you co-opt almost everybody. 
well
Well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like Michael Semple, or those other people, who are telling the truth, who know the country, who've spent 30 years on the ground -- and most importantly of all, the missing component of this -- Afghans themselves, who understand what is going on. 
well
Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem. 
okay
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on -- is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit, or is there serious substance to it? 
 just 
So is that just another version of this? 
 just 
Well we understand this very well. 
well
But you know, at a local level, you scale; everybody in this room is scaled. 
you know
And you see, you're very familiar with this. 
you see
This is just the weight versus the age. 
 just 
Okay, so how do we understand this? 
okay
And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line. 
you see
The bigger you are systematically, according to very well-defined rules, less energy per capita. 
well
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals. 
 just 
Here's just a symbolic picture of that. 
 just 
This shows that in this very simple example, which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing. 
you see
This is just European countries, but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia, always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree. 
 just 
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon. 
you see
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics, but underlying this is the social networks, because this is a universal phenomenon. 
well
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat. 
 just 
And in fact, if you compare it to data, it fits very well with the development of cities and economies. 
well
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before. 
well
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock. 
 just 
Well there's an answer that many people would give. 
well
What I mean by this is we don't just respond to things as we see them, or feel them, or hear them. 
 just 
I want to suggest that this is true, not just for how we think about things, but how we react to things. 
 just 
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art, but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences. 
 just 
Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?" 
well
How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk, but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk -- to think they taste better? 
 just 
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more, you really experience it in a different way. 
 just 
 Now this attraction to objects doesn't just work for celebrity objects. 
 just 
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them? 
okay
They just don't like it. 
 just 
Because this woman comes up -- you see at the end of the video -- she comes up. 
you see
As many of you know, this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench, opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds -- that period of silence. 
you know
 Now I've been talking so far about pleasure, but what I want to suggest is that everything I've said applies as well to pain. 
well
There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button. 
 just 
The second shock hurts just as much, and the third and the fourth and the fifth. 
 just 
Well after many years working in trade and economics, four years ago, I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability. 
well
Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades? 
 just 
And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem. 
 just 
And I was just struck that this is out of place. 
 just 
Well guess what? 
well
And we know that the issue is not just production of food. 
 just 
And here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition, another, neglected and who was deeply malnourished. 
you see
And we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less And in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don't form. 
you see
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth, breastfeeding. 
well
And so today we focus on not just passing out food, but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment, and teaching them about breastfeeding. 
 just 
Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count. 
well
Well two years ago, we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger, and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks. 
well
Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine. 
you see
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop, where instead of bringing in food, we provide digital food, a card. 
well
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil, because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years, when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. 
well
Now if we look at the economic imperative here, this isn't just about compassion. 
 just 
Well, the World Bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- to address malnutrition in those countries. 
well
You look at the cost-benefit analysis, and my dream is to take this issue, not just from the compassion argument, but to the finance ministers of the world, and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition for all of humanity. 
 just 
I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food. 
 just 
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear. 
 just 
 So in a cocktail party like this, if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention," some of you just sat up. 
 just 
And sound places us in time as well, because sound always has time embedded in it. 
well
Well there are a lot of reasons for this. 
well
First of all, we invented ways of recording -- first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well. 
well
Secondly, the world is now so noisy,  with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily, it's just hard to listen; it's tiring to listen. 
 just 
You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake. 
well
Or just try this one on for size. 
 just 
The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these, if you just take one thing away. 
 just 
These are just some of the listening positions, or scales of listening positions, that you can use. 
 just 
And RASA stands for Receive, which means pay attention to the person; Appreciate, making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "okay"; Summarize, the word "so" is very important in communication; and Ask, ask questions afterward. 
okay
Well right now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical. 
well
Do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide? 
you know
And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned. 
 just 
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum, let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned. 
 just 
Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs. 
you see
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs. 
you see
You will say, "Okay, this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes." 
okay
But at the same time, you see this video coming up here. 
you see
And you see, even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver. 
you see
You also have a critical question now, and you say, "Okay, do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working?" 
okay
Well you may see the impact already now. 
well
Intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant -- you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks, but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there. 
you see
It's just that, whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light, your language relies on pulses, discrete pulses, of sound. 
 just 
And just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood, you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else's brain to suit your interests. 
 just 
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound, it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic, and maybe even into its mouth. 
 just 
Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them? 
 just 
Why not? I mean, that's what we do. 
i mean
And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again. 
 just 
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. 
i mean
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" -- as I just said, all the stuff around us. 
 just 
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives. 
 just 
Well, we chose the second option, and language is the result. 
well
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts, but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads. 
you know
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads, and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well, and you put the arrowheads down in front of him, hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows. 
well
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language. 
okay
Now you might say, well, this is just natural. 
well
And so it seems that we use our language, not just to cooperate, but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities, and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside. 
 just 
 Okay, this tendency we have, this seemingly natural tendency we have, towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves, crashes head first into our modern world. 
okay
Because these different languages impose a barrier, as we've just seen, to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom. 
 just 
There are many, many ways of imprinting CDs or DVDs, but those are all being standardized as well. 
well
So just as we manage national parks, where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others, we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors. 
 just 
I actually had a therapist who once said to me, "Eve, you've been coming here for two years, and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body." 
to be honest
All this time I lived in the city because, to be honest, I was afraid of trees. 
to be honest
But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body -- a further disassociation, like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. 
 just 
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated. 
well
These stories saturated my cells and nerves, and to be honest, I stopped sleeping for three years. 
to be honest
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang. 
i mean
What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence. 
well
We look at where the emissions are coming from -- they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth, and we say, okay, well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning, so therefore, the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy. 
well
I won't show you very many graphs today, but if I can just focus on this one for a moment, it really tells us a lot of what we need to know -- which is, quite simply, that if you look, for example, at transportation, a major category of climate emissions, there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air. 
 just 
And this is a huge, huge energy savings, because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars. 
 just 
And as we just heard earlier, of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects. 
 just 
Okay. I do too. 
okay
But if we think differently, I think that, in fact, we can have cities that are not only zero emissions, but have unlimited possibilities as well. 
well
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill, a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying, "We should just euthanize all oiled birds, because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released." 
 just 
Now, mind you -- three days earlier, we had 60 penguins under our care, so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was. 
 just 
Because we all knew that just six years earlier, half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued, and only half of them had survived. 
 just 
We just did not know. 
 just 
And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94 was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks, because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once. 
 just 
So in these six years between these two oil spills, they've built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes. 
well
And as a result, during the Treasure rescue, just 160 penguins died during the transport process, as opposed to 5,000. 
 just 
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned It would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin. 
 just 
So I just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of animals. 
 just 
Well, she could not be more wrong. 
well
And we know from follow-up studies that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins, and bred nearly as successfully. 
 just 
Well, you should care because they're an indicator species. 
well
And then I thought, well maybe I could do something. 
well
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace? 
well
There was no day when humanity came together, separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we're in this together, and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated, then that might be the key to humanity's survival. 
 just 
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day. 
 just 
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people -- all the press, because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day. 
well
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually. 
 just 
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva. 
you see
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic, and that young boy who was a child soldier, who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop. 
 just 
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story." 
well
I was showing the film, and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything. 
 just 
It's just symbolism. 
 just 
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways, because it couldn't not work. 
 just 
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go." 
okay
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you." 
okay
And that attention would help leverage the situation, as well as all of the other sides of it." 
well
You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work." 
 just 
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere. 
 just 
Can you see it? 
you see
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at, where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars, and very precisely. 
 just 
In just over two years of operations, we've found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars. 
 just 
However, there's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall. 
 just 
These freckles are called sunspots, and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun's magnetic field. 
 just 
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg. 
 just 
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes, we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun's magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well. 
well
I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean. 
i mean
 Right: I'll be ready in just a minute, darling. 
 just 
Center: It's just what I've always wanted. 
 just 
Well, I didn't deceive you. 
well
But I was still concerned, so I said, "You know what, I'm not going to do it." 
you know
But you know, these stories, and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest, basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me. 
you know
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased. 
 just 
I mean, this is all very depressing, right -- people have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on. 
i mean
But before doing that, I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know: that our genomes, our genetic material, are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of DNA, which is this famous double-helical molecule. 
 just 
Well we can begin to ask those questions also. 
well
And with absolute difference -- and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position, where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter, and everybody outside Africa has another letter. 
i mean
They are what we just said -- facial features, hair structure, skin color. 
 just 
It's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes But if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don't directly interact with the environment -- our kidneys, our livers, our hearts -- there is no way to say, by just looking at these organs, where in the world they would come from. 
 just 
And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual, even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually, and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today. 
well
Well I don't think that is the case. 
well
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers. 
 just 
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date. 
well
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot. 
i mean
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world. 
 just 
I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her, and his face was just riven with grief and confusion. 
 just 
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. 
 just 
I know those hands and eyes; they touched me as well. 
well
And you know, we have a society, a world, that is paralyzed by fear. 
you know
You know, if compassion is so good for us, I have a question. 
you know
Step back, give your mother a break, okay. 
okay
The wound is just filled with maggots. 
 just 
And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do. 
 just 
And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity, at least in the next few hundred years. 
 just 
If there had been rational technology assessment then, I think they very well might have said, "Let's call the whole thing off." 
well
This consciousness, though, was a little slow to seep through the general population, even people who were very, very well informed. 
well
So there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science, as well as to applied science and medicine. 
well
Well, technology to the rescue. 
well
And IBM, which made them, just didn't know what to do. 
 just 
And nobody knows just why this was so, but one story can reflect something of it. 
 just 
Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now -- bed bugs, killer bees, spam -- and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question. 
well
And evolution, although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people, evolution still is a little bit intangible. 
well
And when I talk about Darwinian evolution, I mean one thing and one thing only, and that is survival of the fittest. 
i mean
Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable? -- if we can answer that, then we're going to know how special biology is, and maybe, just maybe, we'll have some idea of what life really is. 
 just 
Let's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe, maybe the physics of life is as well. 
well
And so the problem with chemists -- and this is a massive advantage as well -- is we like to focus on our elements. 
well
Well what about matter? 
well
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell. 
 just 
Well it divides, it competes, it survives. 
well
Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle. 
well
of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes, just remember, we came from stuff on planet Earth. 
 just 
Now talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life, just pushes the problem further on. 
 just 
And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away. 
 just 
I say, "Well I want molecules." 
well
And just a few months ago in my lab, we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them. 
 just 
But not only just that, we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology. 
 just 
 Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline. 
 just 
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours, once we've set up the right chemistry. 
 just 
But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda. 
you know
You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. 
you know
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful." 
you know
You know, my work is inspired by events such as this. 
you know
You know, I'm making a very important argument. 
you know
You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias -- we're all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. 
you know
It can plan for the long-term benefits of the country and in the process, evict millions of people -- that's just a small technical issue. 
 just 
If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones, you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades. 
you know
you may argue, "Well, maybe Country A is China and Country B is India." 
well
If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index, that data series, go back to the early 1970s, you see exactly the same contrast. 
you see
I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. 
i mean
Okay, they're a little inchoate. 
okay
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me, we probably can't understand it very well. 
well
But in order to try and explain the whole thing, I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it, so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion, and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other, but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty 
 just 
And as you see, in the middle, there is our old friend, the hacker. 
you see
And so I thought to myself, "Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to." 
well
And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers. 
you know
Well, I say nothing, but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin, Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project. 
well
Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website, which led to the industrialization of cybercrime. 
well
And that challenge is: How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal? 
you know
And after that, it just went wild. 
 just 
And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression. 
 just 
They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do. 
 just 
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing. 
 just 
Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha. 
well
 So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator. 
 just 
And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter. 
 just 
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else. 
 just 
 So I make other hats as well. 
well
 And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations. 
 just 
And I thought, "Well, hey! 
well
I really just don't even know how to say hello. 
 just 
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning. 
 just 
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace. 
 just 
And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists, technologists, scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations. 
 just 
So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. 
 just 
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. 
 just 
So if you zoom in on this genome, then what you see, of course, is this double-helix structure -- the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters, or we call them bases: A, C, G and T. 
you see
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers. 
well
And perhaps because of its size, a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it. 
by the way
Well, folks, I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed, and none of you know about it. 
well
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way. 
by the way
I mean, if they have the same mutation, and they get this genetic test and they understand it, then they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early, and potentially live a significantly longer life. 
i mean
And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years, just because of this one thing. 
 just 
I just recently had to buy life insurance, and I was required to answer: A. I have never had a genetic test; B. I've had one, here you go; or C. I've had one and I'm not telling. 
 just 
So anybody who's here today with your significant other, just turn over to them, swab their mouth, send it to the lab and you'll know for sure. 
 just 
But maybe it's a bad thing as well. 
well
Okay? 
okay
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows reflect the idea of our social conscience? 
 just 
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data, I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling, who you may have just seen. 
 just 
Okay, here we go. 
okay
So here you see, from 1960 to 2010, the 50 years of our study. 
you see
As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady. 
you see
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens. 
 just 
Well, as we say in the business, X marks the spot. 
well
This wasn't just an economic story. 
 just 
Now you can't just blame this on imperialism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons. 
 just 
And you know what, it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world -- like Ibrahim Muteferrika, an Ottoman official, the man who introduced printing, very belatedly, to the Ottoman Empire -- who said in a book published in 1731, "Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past begin to dominate so many lands in modern times 
you know
We took all the Germans, we divided them roughly in two, and we gave the ones in the East communism, and you see the result. 
you see
So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. 
 just 
But you know, this is a TED audience, and if I keep talking about institutions, you're going to turn off. 
you know
They're just icons; you click on them. 
 just 
You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at, or try and boil it down to just four, but you'll lose. 
 just 
 Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this, synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process. 
i mean
Competition means, not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500, but within each of these units, there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns. 
well
Not only has Japan been ahead for some time, South Korea has gone into third place, and China is just about to overtake Germany. 
 just 
Now it's just five times, and soon it will be 2.5 times. 
 just 
So I want to end with three questions for the future billions, just ahead of 2016, when the United States will lose its place as number one economy to China. 
 just 
 Bruno Giussani: Niall, I am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that's booming, which is Latin America. 
 just 
Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East; I'm talking about the rise of the Rest, and that includes South America. 
well
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon, which has just accelerated this huge shift, which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. 
 just 
So we were thinking, well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books. 
well
So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach. 
 just 
 JM: Now of course, we were thinking, well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. 
well
Well of course, you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books. 
well
We said, well instead of releasing the full text, we're going to release statistics about the books. 
well
Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends. 
well
Let's suppose that I am thriving, then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did. 
well
Well which one should I use? 
well
And he'd tell you, "Well most people say thrived, but some people say throve." 
well
He'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve, but some thrived." 
well
So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data. 
 just 
Now this is just two out of two billion rows. 
 just 
If you just take influenza, you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. 
 just 
In fact, 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter, people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened, in '51, '52, '53. 
 just 
 And just like that, the bubble burst. 
 just 
We can say, "Well how fast does the bubble burst?" 
well
If you look in German, you see something completely bizarre, something you pretty much never see, which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets, going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945, before rebounding afterward. 
you see
Well, a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. 
well
And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. 
 just 
If the suppression index is very, very, very small, then you very well might be being suppressed. 
well
So what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake. 
 just 
It's not that strove for mediocrity, it's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F. 
 just 
But it turns out this is just a reminder that, although this is a lot of fun, when you interpret these graphs, you have to be very careful, and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. 
 just 
 Actually, we're not going to have to talk, we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. 
 just 
He said there's just not in demand. 
 just 
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. 
 just 
 What is it that you think about just before you get a condom? 
 just 
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience. 
 just 
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, that are going to get them to change their behavior. 
 just 
It might just save their lives. 
 just 
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania, which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. 
 just 
Animals, just like humans, sometimes get strange tumors. 
 just 
But in order for me to explain what that is, I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. 
 just 
Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. 
well
Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild. 
well
Well the answer is, it has. 
well
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells, so is this dog cancer. 
 just 
Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam, a cancer doctor in the 1950s. 
well
So just finally, cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. 
 just 
So I just want to tell you my story. 
 just 
And, oh yes, if you wanted, he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back -- and pull your tooth while he was at it. 
 oh 
In fact, some of you might well know that the barber pole, the red and white stripes, represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon, and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected. 
well
There was just no way. 
 just 
And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor, the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness, it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination. 
well
And they immediately said to me, "Well you are describing a classic ritual." 
well
Well I would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi, and then, incredibly on top of that, disrobing and allowing touch -- I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance. 
well
I think he surely must have known by then that it was vital for me just as it was necessary for him. 
 just 
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon. 
 just 
One was large numbers of bored teenagers who just didn't like school, couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs. 
 just 
That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers, who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business. 
well
And all at no extra cost, no selection, and allowing the pupils the route into university, even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well. 
well
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it, not just with big businesses, but small businesses all over the country. 
 just 
I mean, nor had Ghana, even though we had been trying very hard. 
i mean
I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not. 
i mean
I mean, it was so incredibly close. 
i mean
Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa, and I'm still searching for my identity, but I saw Ghana create democracy better. 
 just 
And these are just some of the examples. 
 just 
How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us? 
you know
You just go to the website, fill out the form, give them $60, and it arrives in the post. 
 just 
So I'm going to tell you about one trial, which is probably the most well-reported trial in the U.K. news media over the past decade. 
well
It's not just about taking a pill, and your performance and your pain getting better. 
 just 
What I've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes. 
 just 
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone, so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day. 
you see
Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients. 
well
And as you go up towards the top of the graph, what you see is each dot is a trial. 
you see
Well they're heinous, they really are. 
well
I read the trials on this. They were all positive. They were all well-conducted. 
well
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness. 
i guess
Well, being different is not that difficult. 
well
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said, "Why [do] women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent and, you know, supportive? 
you know
Well after a few years, I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies, and then started my own media company, which was unthought of during the years that I started my career. 
well
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei -- 20 years old, beautiful. 
well
And because, as you know, the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government, social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit. 
you know
And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially, and taking care of them when they're sick. 
you know
Last year, though, an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China: 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide, just one by one like causing a contagious disease. 
 just 
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility. 
you see
But you know what, half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars. 
you know
So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage. 
you see
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer. 
i guess
I mean, we have life. 
i mean
And then I thought about it a little bit, and I said, "Well, is it really that easy? 
well
Because, yes, if you see something like this, then all right, fine, I'm going to call it life -- no doubt about it. 
you see
And then you see something like that. 
you see
Except, if you look a little bit closer, you see, in fact, that this thing is way too small to be anything like that. 
you see
If you take the lesson of all these pictures, then you realize, well actually maybe it's not that easy. 
well
Well how would you go about it? 
well
Well of course, you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L. 
well
So I'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to, but in fact on processes only. 
 just 
Well I can't really go into the details, but what you see here is some of the entrails. 
well
And as you see here, there are groups that are growing on top of each other, because they are spreading. 
you see
And we put them in, and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation. 
you see
By the way, this is highly accelerated, so it's like a thousand generations a second. 
by the way
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types. 
you see
And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation, like this one, which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before, until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved. 
you see
So I said, "Well, perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process. 
well
In fact, it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be." 
 just 
So that inspired me to think about, well, what if I try to use this idea in order, not to detect random texts from texts with meaning, but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. 
well
And it is detectable not just in amino acids. 
 just 
Now you could ask: well, what about these Avidians? 
well
I can tell you indeed it is, because this type of spectrum, just like what you've seen in books, and just like what you've seen in amino acids, it doesn't really matter how you change the environment, it's very robust; it's going to reflect the environment. 
 just 
And now what I did there is, I was being nasty, I just turned up the heat again and again. 
 just 
And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice. 
 just 
Well, I think we learn a number of things from that. 
well
Well we can make life. We can make life in the computer. 
well
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from." 
well
Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more. 
well
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff. 
 just 
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. 
 just 
Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more. 
 just 
Think back when you were just a kid. 
 just 
 Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry, it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults. 
well
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent. 
well
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth, that number well more than doubles. 
well
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage. 
you see
And the plastics, we get from oil, which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract. 
well
Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered. 
well
Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another. 
well
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know. 
well
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics. 
 just 
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here. 
you see
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way, those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics. 
by the way
This is just one example. 
 just 
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke. 
well
Well a good place to start is with waste. 
well
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products. 
 just 
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time. 
 just 
And finally, I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff." 
 just 
Up to and around about the Second World War, conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it, within an inch of their lives. 
 just 
And I remember at the beginning of my career, again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras, I would be going completely insane on the podium, trying to engender a small scale crescendo really, just a little upsurge in volume. 
 just 
South Africans just make music really freely. 
 just 
And what I'm going to say to you now is I'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self-confidence, to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears, you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue, fiber, DNA, what makes a great piece of music great. 
 just 
Did you know that TED is a tune? 
you know
Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system, which composers have been using for hundreds of years, which proves actually that it does. 
well
If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G -- and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale: H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go. 
 just 
Okay, we'll play it for you again now, and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D. 
okay
 Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely. 
 oh 
CH: Once more with vim.  There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see. 
you see
Well done, ladies and gentlemen. 
well
Now this prince loved his music, but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time, which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border, a place called Esterhazy -- a long way from the big city of Vienna. 
 just 
And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now. 
 just 
But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this, that where there is trust, there is music -- by extension life. 
well
Let me give you just one example of this. 
 just 
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person. 
 just 
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies, just barely walking and talking, would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli. 
 just 
But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what they thought everybody must like. 
 just 
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually demonstrated it. 
 just 
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless. 
i mean
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. 
 just 
Well it turns out that the babies, the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings. 
well
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this? 
well
Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well. 
well
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage. 
well
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're production and marketing. 
 just 
And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world. 
 just 
Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student. 
 just 
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go. 
 just 
They're just learning how to count. 
 just 
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. 
 just 
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. 
 just 
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out. 
okay
AG: Okay, hypothesis two. 
okay
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis. 
okay
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis. 
okay
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature? 
well
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all. 
well
And I think just the opposite is true. 
 just 
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. 
 just 
And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet. 
you see
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important. 
 just 
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new, or when we're in a new city for the first time. 
well
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. 
by the way
When I was little -- and by the way, I was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker. 
by the way
You probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is, but I think it's about feeling beauty. 
well
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off, click click, when you closed the door in a car? 
 just 
I thought, well what the hell's that about? 
well
I thought, well that's not good enough. 
well
Do you know what it is? Anyone? 
you know
You see, using this bit, the thinky bit, the slow bit of the brain -- using that. 
you see
It's actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds. 
 just 
Would you mind taking the brain out, and I just want you to feel something. 
 just 
The lady over there is actually crying, by the way. 
by the way
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face. 
by the way
It isn't just about nice. 
 just 
Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. 
 just 
And that's packed in there as well. 
well
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things, just something that's exquisitely beautiful, that's universally beautiful. 
 just 
Well it obviously isn't. 
well
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you how exquisite this object is. 
i mean
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension. 
 just 
I mean, if I just go through some of them now -- I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects, and that does it consummately well, you can see it can. 
well
This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider means there's something going on underneath it -- in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably, taking the power from the engine. 
by the way
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy, as well as "Maestro," because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time. 
well
Did you see what I did? 
you see
So that's okay, isn't it? 
okay
This is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer. 
you know
You all, I guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. 
i guess
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty. 
you know
Are you ready? Okay. 
okay
Well in this case it isn't, because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology. 
well
And you know what those products and services are, because you own some of them. 
you know
Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting, commerce and social connectivity, but where did it all come from? 
well
So let's just run through these guys. 
 just 
So this is where the mouse came from as well. 
well
We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version. 
well
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name, especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office. 
well
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it, because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything; it was just plain text. 
 just 
I thought, well, you know, interesting, but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this. 
well
And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess. 
i guess
Okay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar. 
 just 
They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." 
okay
Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished that email out of my Spam folder. 
you know
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives. 
 just 
Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. 
well
By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls a post-truth society. 
 just 
Well, there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass. 
well
 Pamela Meyer: Okay, what were the telltale signs? 
okay
Well first we heard what's known as a non-contracted denial. 
well
Now if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ..." 
well
You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door. 
 just 
Well guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying. 
well
Well guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. 
well
They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview. 
 just 
Why do they do that? Well, we all do the same thing. 
well
Interviewer: Are you going to do that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test. 
well
PM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. 
you know
There are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash. 
 just 
And in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way, go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you." 
 just 
These behaviors are just behaviors. 
 just 
But when you see clusters of them, that's your signal. 
you see
And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother. 
you see
 Diane Downs: At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth. 
 just 
PM: Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions. 
okay
So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code. 
 just 
You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one. 
 just 
And when you do that, the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit. 
 just 
But it's just one chemical. 
 just 
 Just a little. 
 just 
See for me, cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet, it's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay. 
 just 
The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia, which are the equivalent of plant roots. 
you see
I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms, so I formed the Decompiculture Society, a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options, seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom. 
 just 
And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like. 
 just 
I mean, is there something wrong with you?" 
i mean
I said, "I want to live and dig wells for five years." 
well
"Dig wells for five years? 
well
You went to the most expensive school and college in India, and you want to dig wells for five years?" 
well
So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing? 
well
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'" He looked quietly at me and said, "You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work." 
okay
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well." 
well
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?" 
well
He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?" 
you know
  I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside. 
 just 
And if we just take one cell's worth of this code and unwind it, it's a meter long, two nanometers thick. 
 just 
To change its state, by the way, takes two volts from a millisecond pulse. 
by the way
Each of us, every day, need just eight glasses of this, because we're human. 
 just 
It's just wrong. 
 just 
And whenever I go round to somebody who says, "You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult. 
you know
That's what I say in my mind. And I just say "thank you," and I go on to the next one. 
 just 
Some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation -- and obviously, a quite mishandled one. 
 just 
Okay, but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit? 
okay
This issue isn't just theoretical. 
 just 
And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace. 
 just 
Cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons -- they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror. 
 just 
But in doing so, they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict -- as we've just seen, a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us: European allies, NATO members, our American friends and allies, our other Western allies, and maybe, by forcing their hand a little, our Russian and Chinese partners. 
 just 
I mean, the functional impairment is clear. 
i mean
They're called body-powered prostheses, which were invented just after the Civil War, refined in World War I and World War II. 
 just 
Here you see a patent for an arm in 1912. 
you see
It's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient. 
you see
They work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand, because your hand muscles are still there. 
well
Well how about with higher levels of amputation? 
well
Well our patients have to use very code-y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs. 
well
There are several available on the market, and here you see a few. 
you see
They contain just a hand that will open and close, a wrist rotator and an elbow. 
 just 
Well we need a neural interface, a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it's intuitive, it's natural, like for you and I. 
well
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain, going down your spinal cord, out the nerves and to your periphery. 
well
You have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts. And it's just too hard to use now and for my patients today. 
 just 
He's just a saint of a man -- 54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder. 
 just 
And Jesse's a good crane operator, and he did okay by our standards. 
okay
First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle, then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up. 
 just 
And after six months, the nerves grew in well, and you could see strong contractions. 
well
On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis, and he's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other. 
you see
On the right side, two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis -- which, by the way, is the same physical arm, just programmed a little different -- you can see that he's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks. 
 just 
And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away, just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up-down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal. 
 just 
You see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use, and on the right, it is two months. 
you see
Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up. 
okay
AK: Well, it was a little difficult, because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep. 
well
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work. 
 just 
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery, took six more months to have all the reinnervation. 
okay
I could work them just by my thoughts. 
 just 
TK: Okay, this was my goal. 
okay
 And here you can see, on Jesse's chest, when he just tried to do three different things, you can see three different patterns. 
 just 
So we've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals. 
by the way
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train. 
 just 
I had to hook it up to a computer, so I couldn't just train it anywhere. 
 just 
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off. 
 just 
So now it's able to train with just this little piece on the back. 
 just 
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open, because I work with kids, and so all the time you're clapping and singing, so I was able to do that again, which was really good. 
 just 
She said that when she just ran it across the table, it felt like her finger was rocking. 
 just 
And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes. 
you see
So those are just some of our goals. 
 just 
We took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm. 
 just 
 What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007. 
 just 
So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible. 
 just 
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet -- satellite images, weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. 
well
That's both historical as well as real data. 
well
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. 
you see
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left. 
you see
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. 
 just 
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent. 
you see
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data. 
you see
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being. 
well
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship. 
well
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. 
well
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others. 
you see
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures? 
 just 
We're not just talking about a fluke. 
 just 
  I've shown you just a few things in italics here. 
 just 
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common. 
 just 
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan. 
well
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things. 
 just 
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax. 
well
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality. 
 just 
This is just one example. 
 just 
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy. 
you see
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference. 
well
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes. 
well
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting. 
well
And so many people, I guess, watch those videos. 
i guess
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word. 
i mean
In any case, Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War in downtown Manhattan. 
 just 
Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War, where millions of men fought each other in the trenches, getting nowhere, making no progress, and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy. 
 just 
And for Norden as well, this device had incredible moral importance, because Norden was a committed Christian. 
well
Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible. 
well
Well it allowed you to do that. 
well
Well, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail. 
well
It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings, and they don't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle. 
well
And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions. 
well
Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945? 
well
And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was, there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany. 
 just 
And over the course of 22 bombing missions, the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs on this 757 acre chemical plant, Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant? 
well
And by the way, all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis? 
by the way
Well it turns out that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss, was very enamored of German engineers. 
well
So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war -- which also, by the way, didn't work very well. 
well
Well because we live in an age of Norden bombsights. 
well
If you go to the Pentagon, they will say, "You know what, now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft." 
you know
And you know what, it's true; they actually can do that now. 
you know
You know what the answer was? 
you know
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight. 
well
Well it's extraordinary. 
well
But do you know what the crucial thing is? 
you know
You might know that, so far, in just the dawn of this revolution, we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes, and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers, causes of cancer. 
 just 
And so, I guess you'd say, dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines, I went back to school, in chemistry, with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source, the crowd source, the collaborative network that we have access to within academia, that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies 
i guess
We just started mailing it to our friends. 
 just 
We thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves. 
 just 
Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug, well, that would be, of course, impossible and, rightly, illegal to do in humans. 
well
And on the animal on the right, you see that the cancer was responding. 
you see
Well, they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance. 
well
So we did just the opposite. 
 just 
 Because now, we've shared this molecule, just since December of last year, with 40 laboratories in the United States and 30 more in Europe -- many of them pharmaceutical companies, seeking now to enter this space, to target this rare cancer that, thankfully right now, is quite desirable to study in that industry. 
 just 
What this research taught us -- not just my lab, but our institute, and Harvard Medical School more generally -- is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery; that our center, which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other, never made one of its own. 
 just 
What we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent, motivated, enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide. 
well
I want to leave you with just two ideas. 
 just 
This string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted, I suppose, or Twittered worldwide, is the chemical identity of our pro compound. 
i suppose
And as my image is already inside the paper, I just have to remove what's not from that story. 
 just 
And it's also just getting to the essential of things. 
 just 
I cannot speak for all my images, so I'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title. 
 just 
And I still feel I'm running, it's just the training to become a long-distance papercutter. 
 just 
And then you can just walk behind them and try them on. 
 just 
So it's regional memories, and they are just randomly moved by the wind. 
 just 
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?" 
 just 
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique. 
well
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with? 
well
And then literally just out of nowhere, the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?" 
 just 
So I pulled out my little PDA, and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th." 
okay
And so we're sitting there, and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth, he says, "Okay, I have enough information here. 
 just 
By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you. 
by the way
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes." 
well
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?" 
okay
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble, give us a call -- we'll take care of it." 
you know
Just letting you know. Heads up." 
you know
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. 
 just 
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool. 
okay
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me? 
well
Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. 
well
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. 
you see
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? 
well
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd. 
 just 
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed. 
 just 
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich. 
by the way
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home? 
you know
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. 
well
And you know very little about me actually. 
you know
Well you have to take control over it. 
well
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. 
well
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. 
 just 
And you know, some of my friends have always said, "Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this? 
you know
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there. 
 just 
 Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious. 
 just 
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those. 
 just 
So it's just become another day. 
 just 
I mean, when we update a status message, we don't really think about how long that's going to take. 
i mean
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done. 
 just 
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at. 
well
But I countered, "Well men's brains make this too. 
well
I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?" 
 just 
Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received, the more their brain produced oxytocin, and the more oxytocin on board, the more money they returned. 
well
I just found the molecule behind it. 
 just 
You sit in a gas station all day, you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you. 
you see
I just found this. What do you think we should do with it?" 
 just 
"Well this is very valuable. 
well
"Hey, a guy just found it." 
 just 
He said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward." 
you know
I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars, and when the guy comes ... " You see it. I was conned. 
you see
Two weeks ago, I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands -- very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia. 
 just 
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in. 
you see
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. 
 just 
Now like with anything that's really different from the status quo, it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft. 
well
The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time. 
 just 
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane. 
 just 
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out. 
 just 
And they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top. 
 just 
Now, bad weather comes in, just land, fold up the wings, drive home. 
 just 
And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment Door-to-door travel time is reduced, because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space, taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger, you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go. 
 just 
Now if movement is so important, how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement? 
well
But we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do. 
well
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where? 
well
If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail, against IBM's Deep Blue, well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win. 
well
Now a lot of robotics is very impressive, but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages. 
 just 
Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts, just aim for the same spot over and over again. 
 just 
But you know that your senses are not perfect, and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red, representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1. 
you know
Well why would I bother doing that? 
well
Well there's good reasons. 
well
Well there's one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person. 
well
It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself as well as other people can. 
well
I'll show you just one part of our study. 
 just 
Either no time delay, in which case light would just tickle your palm, or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second. 
 just 
And by 0.2 of a second, it's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything. 
 just 
And so they take it in turns to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. 
 just 
So think about just a point to point movement. 
 just 
Well let's think about what really happens. 
well
And finally, I want to remind you, when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks, the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic. 
you see
CA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed. 
well
Okay. 
okay
    Uh oh. 
 uh 
We'll just take one example here: a virus is a natural system, right? 
 just 
So how do we do this? Well, we use a model system that we term a protocell. 
well
"If we accept the theory of evolution, then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist between the inorganic and the organic world, or between the non-living and living world, forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life" -- so, the ones I just discussed -- "to which other attributes will be slowly added evolutionary actions of the environment." 
 just 
As you know, when you put oil and water together, they don't mix, but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form, and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell, as you will see later. 
you know
So that's just forming some body stuff, right? 
 just 
So just through self-assembly, mixing things together in the lab, we can come up with, say, a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body, right? 
 just 
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet, but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something, to actually become dynamic, as we'll see here. 
 just 
Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. 
okay
Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior. 
 just 
Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry inside that, when activated, the protocell starts to vibrate around, just dancing. 
 just 
And we just put these two together in the same system. 
 just 
So there's population A, there's population B, and then we activate the system, and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones, they all come together. They fuse together to form one big blob, and the other protocell just dances around. And this just happens until all of the energy in the system is So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times, and one time something very interesting happened. 
 just 
Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit, while protocell B does the fusing, okay? 
okay
Now we have a dancing protocell and a self-replication event. Right.  Just with blobs of chemicals, again. 
 just 
Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay? 
okay
They look really good, very nice movement, and also they appear to have some kind of around each other and follow each other, similar to what we've seen before -- but again, working with just primordial conditions, no pure chemicals. 
 just 
Well, they came up with three very general criteria. First is -- and they're listed here. 
well
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement. 
well
So I'll just show you an instance -- so when people enter the room, it activates this object. 
 just 
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume. 
well
So, as you can imagine, this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry. 
well
As you see here, we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal. 
you see
This happens to be the cloud of points In here you see a traditional 2D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation, and of course And here, this is a fly-through the cloud of points of Tikal, and here you see it rendered and photo-textured with the photography that we take of the site. 
you see
It's used for studies, for visualization, as well as for education. 
well
However, to me, the 500 is really just the first 500. 
 just 
Well, I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so, while I've been speaking, you have been scanned. 
well
You can look from different vantage points, but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd, just to show the amount of detail that we can create. 
 just 
That's basically, if you hold two fists together, it's just slightly larger than the two fists. 
 just 
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain, which is just turning around there. 
 just 
And what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there. 
you see
But you can also see things underneath there as well. 
well
And this is just showing this here -- this frozen tissue, and it's being cut. 
 just 
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves. 
 just 
Two great examples are drugs, Prozac and Wellbutrin. 
well
I'll just close by saying that the tools are there, and this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent. 
 just 
Now in the meantime, I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well. 
well
And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day. 
 just 
Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005. 
well
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt, putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement. 
 just 
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. 
 just 
And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands. 
you know
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. 
 just 
You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. 
you know
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. 
 just 
Stefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side. 
well
Commentator Two: And as he approaches the ground, he's going to pull down on those toggles to flare, slow himself down just a little bit, and then come in for a nice landing. 
 just 
 And his equipment as well. 
well
And when I strap just this little harness, this little wing, I really have the feeling of being a bird. 
 just 
You are just in the element. 
 just 
So the idea was, okay, keep that feeling of freedom, but change the vector and increase the time. 
okay
YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit. 
 just 
I just try to keep my mobility through new activities. 
 just 
YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters, it's not such a big problem with oxygen. 
okay
So I just check before it's finished. 
 just 
I thought, okay, I will go out. 
okay
So the next thing I saw was just blue. 
 just 
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons: so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that, just on his head. 
 just 
Civil aviation is something that we know very well. 
well
Something that I know very well, these principles. 
well
BG: It's well said. 
well
It's possible to start already now, it's just too dangerous. 
 just 
So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010. 
 just 
I mean, for soccer, you could go to a soccer team. 
i mean
Well, this is how I approached it. This is what I did. 
well
But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible. 
 just 
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe. 
 just 
But if you look in nature, you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans. 
you see
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans, which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence. 
 just 
You're going to see, in just two weeks, the normal worms are old. 
 just 
But everything else is just lying there. 
 just 
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans -- which probably most of you haven't seen one -- you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting? 
you know
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?" 
well
 Okay. 
okay
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA, they're instructions to make a protein that does something. 
well
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell. 
you see
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell? 
okay
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell, that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well; the animal lives longer. 
well
You know about a lot of them. 
you know
And just like any population, most of the people live to be about 70 or 80, but some live to be 90 or 100. 
 just 
And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted. 
well
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants, a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues, and repair damage. 
well
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor. 
you see
The receptor isn't working as well. 
well
And it's just sitting on one of them. 
 just 
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes, genes I call carrot-giver genes, whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly. 
well
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active, then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is. 
well
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment. 
well
And that, we think, is registered by the animal as a danger signal, a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity. 
okay
He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer, the window person, the painter, the floor person. 
 just 
And not only that, it can also just last longer, even if there isn't a hurricane. 
 just 
And mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. 
 just 
Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me, what you could do now pretty well in the lab, if you were allowed ethically, is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer? 
well
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes, they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity. 
 just 
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems. 
 just 
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles, you can't tell the difference, just by looking, between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles. 
 just 
All of the magic, I think, that may well be taken away by science is then replaced by something as wonderful. 
well
And that to me as well, that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds, well Many Worlds theory -- one of the most beautiful, fascinating, sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation -- is a wonderful thing. 
well
Well, there is one proviso. 
well
 Though I'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well. 
well
No, I just spit out a tooth. 
 just 
You may well have your own children and think, "Oh no, my child's best." 
well
Now in many ways, that's just a survival thing. 
 just 
But we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love. 
 just 
And do you know what, that might be enough. 
you know
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold. 
 just 
Did you know that 80 percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes? 
you know
And aren't we grateful for our brains that can, you know, take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world? 
you know
Child: When I watch TV, it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend, and when you explore, you get more imagination than you already had, and when you get more imagination, it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things, like the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach, or something, and it could be beautiful. 
 just 
 Elderly Man: You think this is just another day in your life? 
 just 
It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. 
 just 
If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is, if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day, then you will have spent this day very well. 
well
We just think of the weather, and even with the weather, we don't think of all the many nuances of weather. 
 just 
We just think of good weather and bad weather. 
 just 
So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart. 
 just 
And so I wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings, and let them flow through you, that everyone whom you will meet on this day will be blessed by you, just by your eyes, by your smile, by your touch, just by your presence. 
 just 
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future. 
 just 
So for do-it-yourselfers, we provide free, very well-tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free. 
well
And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community. 
well
In our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy. 
 just 
What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs. 
well
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff. 
 just 
And I didn't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder, I could actually feel it. 
 just 
I was so shocked, I was just as shocked as everybody else, and I was so discouraged, but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet that I would be able to do this again. 
 just 
And just this past February, I won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals —  — which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. 
 just 
And by "regretted it," I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place -- this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side -- and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street. 
 just 
But I had always felt like, look, you know, given who I was then, given the information I had on hand. 
you know
And okay, I wouldn't change it. 
okay
It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage. 
by the way
Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes, it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome. 
well
We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly, but almost came out well. 
well
But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back and say, well okay, but overall, what do we regret most in life? 
well
But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life, you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank. 
you know
So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap, or company A versus company B, or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius, you know what, let it go. 
you know
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!" 
i mean
We just want it to vanish. 
 just 
And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing, we can experience a huge range of regret. 
 just 
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work. 
 just 
I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days. 
i mean
And that's just regret about tattoos. 
 just 
And do you guys just want to see it? 
 just 
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed. 
you know
It's just that I don't like how it looks. 
 just 
But I'll let you see it anyway. 
you see
Well it did. 
well
And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body -- partly as a writer, but also just as a human being. 
 just 
But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer, so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. 
 just 
Of course, that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. 
 just 
The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. 
well
Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion. 
 just 
We want beauty; we don't just want function. 
 just 
 So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. 
you know
Many of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf, when he wrote that. 
you know
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is. 
 just 
As a musician, I can tell you that if I had to have a cochlear implant, I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken, because I know that music would never sound the same to me. 
 just 
Okay, play that video please. 
okay
Girl: I have written two books.  Girl: No, the other one was a book.  JN: Well this book has seven chapters, and the last chapter is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf." 
well
Girl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying. 
well
Girl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything. 
 just 
I mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music. 
i mean
Now if we could just play this. 
 just 
 Okay, now if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves, let's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone. 
okay
Now the other issue comes with, not just the ability to tell pitches apart, but the ability to tell sounds apart. 
 just 
Now the next question is, well how does it really sound? 
well
Again, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to. 
 just 
I know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke. 
well
So I just want to conclude with the following words. 
 just 
Next thing you know, two guys in white appear, they give you the strange t-shirt, take you to the nearest mental institution. 
you know
Well, the first one - analytic skills. 
well
So, this system was just obsolete, they expired. 
 just 
I'm meeting different people throughout the world, and they are, you know, academics, and professors, and doctors, and they will always talk conditions. 
you know
And, I mean, there is a set of conditions. 
i mean
Well, the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. 
well
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko, you all know the outcome. 
you see
Whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military, somebody was thinking about it before. 
you see
It was on Tahrir square, where the international community was constantly frightened that, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution. 
you know
What they organized -- Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying, a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims, the world has just changed the picture, but somebody was thinking about this previously. So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place, shouting, and you know, showing off in front of the security forces. 
you know
You have the enthusiasm higher, you see the fear is starting to melt. 
you see
Day two, you see people running towards the police instead of from the police, in Egypt. 
you see
You know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit. 
you know
Well, that's just the beginning of the show. 
well
So, I mean, these are the things you can do. 
i mean
or, you know, the economy, if you sit down and click. 
you know
Well, the million-dollar question. What will happen in the Arab world? 
well
Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform, or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate? 
 just 
Okay, outstanding. So I invented that. 
okay
The reason it works is because humans, at least non-visually-impaired humans, have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters, whereas computer programs simply can't do it as well yet. 
well
 And then I started thinking, well, of course, we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs, because the security of the Web sort of depends on them. 
well
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet. 
 just 
Now, of course, we're not just insulting people. 
 just 
Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar, like this CAPTCHA.  Then what you're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it. 
you see
 Okay, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA. 
okay
Okay, that's Severin Hacker. 
okay
By the way, you did hear me correctly; his last name is Hacker. 
by the way
Okay, so there's a lot of things to say about this question. 
okay
Well the problem with that is that it's not yet good enough and it probably won't be for the next 15 to 20 years. 
well
So I'll just let you read. 
 just 
So he's just explaining something. 
 just 
  Okay, so computer translation, not yet good enough. 
okay
So now the next question you may have is, well why can't we just pay people to do this? 
well
And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school. 
 just 
So the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner, we give you very, very simple sentences. 
 just 
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software. 
well
And not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's way more interesting. 
well
Because you see with Duolingo, people are actually learning with real content. 
you see
But perhaps more surprisingly, the translations that we get from people using the site, even though they're just beginners, the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators, which is very surprising. 
 just 
By the way, I'm the one talking here, but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team, some of whom are here. 
by the way
This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America, and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity Here's one of our field sites, and just to give you a sense of perspective, this little blue smudge here, that's one of my collaborators. 
 just 
Spiders are not just everywhere, but they're extremely diverse. 
 just 
It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. 
 just 
To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like, this is a dragline silk protein, it's just a portion of it, from the black widow spider. 
 just 
This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night.  So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored in the glycines with green, and the alanines in red, and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. 
 just 
This makes testing spider silk really, really easy to do in the laboratory, because we're actually, you know, testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins. 
you know
So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing, which is basically, you know, tugging on one end of the fiber, very amenable. 
you know
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then basically when an insect hit the web, it would just trampoline right off of it. 
 just 
So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really, really stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. 
 just 
What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph, the higher the toughness. 
you see
In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks, personally, I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself. 
 just 
That's just the best.  It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me, and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk. 
 just 
The next time you see a spider web, please, pause and look a little closer. 
you see
Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play. 
okay
So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard. 
 just 
  Okay, so first of all, let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,  Burniss Travis on the bass,  and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano. 
okay
So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second. 
 just 
 So you see, he played this note. 
you see
Well we're jazz musicians, so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. 
well
 Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it. 
 just 
If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way, and I just jump right in ... 
 just 
ready, just play some time. 
 just 
That's a very appealing picture, however, it's just not true. 
 just 
And do you know where the operating room is? 
you know
Well if cancer can be caught early, enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out, excised with surgery, I don't care if it has this gene or that gene, or if it has this protein or that protein, it's in the jar. 
well
We do our best, based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience, we say, you know what, the cancer's gone. 
you know
And very often they say, "You know what, points A and B are okay, but point C, you still have some residual cancer there. 
you know
And this whole process: "Okay you're done. 
okay
I mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it, we're still operating in the dark. 
i mean
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today, is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go. 
 just 
You see a lot of little, roundish bumps there. 
you see
Well with our technology, the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer. 
well
The patient has cancer, you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer Well you can see this on an MRI. 
well
But you know what, these little nerves are so small, in the context of prostate cancer, that they are actually never seen. 
you know
They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature. 
 just 
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out. 
you see
Do you know where it's going? 
you know
They asked themselves a question: If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change, well why can't the same be done for conservation? 
well
But the question arises: Okay, so how much do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall? 
okay
It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests. 
 just 
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. 
well
And just watch the change in colors in India, China, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. 
 just 
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries, that provide fish for the poor, that answer is more like $11,000. 
you see
So is this just a story from South Thailand? 
 just 
And here's what the same calculation looks like, which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years -- by a group called TRUCOST. 
well
Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it. 
well
And by the way, these are my favorites -- externalities calculation and green carbon markets. 
by the way
It's not doing too well. We've over-issued. 
well
A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency, you get what you see, declining prices. 
you see
What we're also missing is blue carbon, which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon -- more than 55 percent. 
by the way
Well I'm afraid not. 
well
Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that. 
well
Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way. 
by the way
we decided to give the people what they wanted. So this picture is an example of printed food, and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation. So this is all the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know, a standard maki roll, printed onto a little piece of paper. 
you know
The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish.  BR: But it's not all just edible pictures. 
you see
So we take a carrot cake, put it in a blender, and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice, and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream, I guess, and it comes off looking like, you know, Jupiter's floating around your plate. 
you know
Instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn't eat, we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know. 
you know
So when you're looking at this thing in the dining room, you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos, and it's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert, and it's just kind of like a mind-ripper. 
 just 
BR: One of the really cool things about the lab, besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen, is that, you know, with this new equipment, and this new approach, all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open, and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created, they just kept going further and further out there. 
you know
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out. 
you see
And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this.  BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine, Chris Jones. This is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas, they're hard to understand. 
 just 
They're hard to just get automatically. 
 just 
There's a lot of research and a lot of failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error -- so we don't always get it right, and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people. 
i guess
BR: So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles, wasted energy, and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna, or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place, with local, organic produce; so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin. 
you see
I told the staff, let's just take a bunch of wild plants, think of them as food ingredients. As long as they're non-poisonous to the human body, go out around Chicago sidewalks, take it, blend it, cook it and then have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto. 
 just 
Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think.  BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task like this -- this is another one of those hated us for. But we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general, because these are ingredients, you know, plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with, and two, we have no reference for how to cook these things because 
you know
This disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are, even if we just swapped out, say, one of these for flour, that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste. 
 just 
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around. 
well
And my lung collapsed, so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening. 
well
 So they pulled back and they were looking at each other, and they were going, "Okay, what skills do we have in this room? 
okay
And then they had to figure out: "Well she needs furniture. 
well
 So eventually what went on is they decided that, well I need to learn to speak. 
well
So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when Sally finally got my confidence built. 
 just 
So we'll just keep moving on. 
 just 
So one of the seniors just came up to me, and she pushed me up to the corner and she said, "When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there. 
 just 
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it." 
 just 
And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it; we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved. 
 just 
And we could take a very simple view and say, well, it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams, or when we go under anesthesia, when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia. 
well
Well first of all, it is a mind, which is a flow of mental images. 
well
through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner, what I get is the following. 
you see
You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. 
you see
So just think of this: you have a grid of neurons, and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid, and you get a warping of your mental experience. 
 just 
And in that image there, you see a variety of islands of what I call image-making regions in the brain. 
you see
And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps, can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around, which is the association cortex, where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making. 
you see
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this. 
 just 
Well it so happens that we have a singular body. 
well
There is just one reference point, which is the body. 
 just 
You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly. 
you know
It's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem, there are, to make it simple, all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior, different aspects of our body. 
 just 
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe -- and I could be wrong, but I don't think I am -- that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings -- primordial feelings, by the way. 
by the way
Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run. 
okay
And the first mate thinks, "Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end." 
well
Now just don't untie me no matter what." 
 just 
He just wants to get to the front row. 
 just 
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification. 
 just 
Well resisting temptation is hard, as the 19th century English economist Nassau William Senior said, "To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power, or to seek distant rather than immediate results, are among the most painful exertions of the human will." 
well
I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal. 
i mean
And I thought, well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that. 
well
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought, well I could give it to the neo-Nazis. 
well
So ultimately, I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway. 
 just 
On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret. 
 just 
So the first is, when you've got one of these devices going, such as this contract to write everyday or pay, it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control. 
 just 
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device, I am nothing, I have no self-discipline." 
 just 
And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place -- like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut, and I have no defense mechanism," -- you just eat it. 
 just 
You say, "Well, of course I can't write today, because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews, and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that. 
well
If you're like most people, just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before. 
 just 
By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome, people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future. 
well
As you move down the ladder of apartments, you see that they get worse and worse. 
you see
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider. 
 just 
It's not telling you which way to put the slider, it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self. 
 just 
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being. 
well
This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older. 
 just 
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing. 
 just 
And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding, aging and weight gain software to see how he would look. 
 just 
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image. 
well
My job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true. 
well
For many years, we were just providing them with artificial limbs. 
 just 
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion. 
you know
You know, when you want to forget, you don't want to see things, so you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside and say, "That's enough." 
you know
A bomb fell not far from my car -- well, far enough, but big noise. 
well
The cars disappeared as well. 
well
Well I'm not a particularly brave person, I have to confess it, but I could not just ignore him. 
well
Well without thinking, I told him "Come tomorrow. 
well
So I said, "Well I will give him some money." 
well
In the evening, I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters, and I told them -- I lied -- I told them, "Listen, we are going to start a couple of hours per day, just a few repairs." 
 just 
You know, 50 meters can be a long distance but we managed to reach the shelter. 
you know
Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours, but we never, we never closed it again. 
well
He told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well." 
well
I said, "Okay." 
okay
Najmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy in the carpentry shop." 
well
"Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet. 
well
And you know what? 
you know
Sometimes you see them, they look, "Oh." 
you see
And you see the faces. 
you see
And it's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability. 
well
Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over; not at all. We are going on. 
well
Recently we have just started a program, a sport program -- basketball for wheelchair users. 
 just 
Well I don't know yet, but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends, they have it already in mind. 
well
I thought, oh my gosh. 
 oh 
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being. 
well
But that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act, we can do something about. 
well
And here's an example of what I mean. 
i mean
How was I supposed to live it? 
i suppose
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act? 
i suppose
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine. 
 just 
And he wrote that, while he was in the camp, he could tell, should they ever be released, which of the people would be okay and which would not. 
okay
You see, if you have, over time, reacted negatively to past events and people, by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain. 
you see
I mean, as girls, we start off feisty -- "Yeah, who says?" 
i mean
And if we can do that, it will not just be for ourselves. 
 just 
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned, if you like, to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world, the new powers that exist in the world, are beginning to take form. 
 just 
By the way, it happens about once every century. 
by the way
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times. 
well
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation. 
 just 
Now that suits the powerful It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint, but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later, unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted -- international trade, the Internet, etc. -- but also by the things you don't want -- international criminality, international terrorism. 
 just 
You see, our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison, which is about destroying our systems and our ways. 
you see
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions. 
by the way
And that's a big problem, and we'll return to it in just a second. 
 just 
My second point is, and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing, but power is not just shifting vertically, it's also shifting horizontally. 
 just 
Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking, away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard] to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim. 
well
You see India, you see Brazil. 
you see
You see increasingly that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans, much more like Europe in the 19th century. 
you see
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together, it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world. 
you know
The interrelationship of nations, well it's always existed. 
well
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet; it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it? 
by the way
And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic -- except for me. I don't agree with this. 
i guess
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos, it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so. 
 just 
I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading, surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words. 
i mean
And I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this, but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents, which I think is a pretty good price. 
 just 
So I thought of a different way by thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes. 
well
So for $60, I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just 600 summaries, which would actually be quite nice. 
 just 
Now some of you might actually right now be thinking, It's downright crazy to have 10 TEDTalks summarized into just six words. 
 just 
I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. 
i guess
So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well. 
well
I mean, when I asked them to summarize the 10 TEDTalks at the same time, some took the easy route out. 
i mean
They just had some general comment. 
 just 
I mean that's the essence of it all. 
i mean
Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction. 
i mean
I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words -- which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content. 
 just 
Because I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED, but to me they felt a bit bland, or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them. 
 just 
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. 
well
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well, decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent. 
well
I mean, on the slide, you can see that on our sensitive side, these cells that are responding to the drug, when we start blocking the protein, the number of dying cells -- those colored dots -- they're going down. 
i mean
Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell. 
well
But my work wasn't just about the research. 
 just 
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research, it was about finding my passion, when I didn't even know what I was doing. 
 just 
It confused me; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season? 
well
At first, I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients. 
 just 
So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants. 
well
You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict, the ones we used to read about. 
you see
The situation, to be honest, is very serious. 
to be honest
We just have to persevere." 
 just 
Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that. 
you know
We know from our personal experiences that it's easy sometimes just to walk, and sometimes you may need to fight. 
 just 
♫ can never take away ♫ ♫ Running through the darkness of night ♫ ♫ with a child by her side ♫ ♫ Oh Lord, won't you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ Oh Lord, won't you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ Daybreak brings a sign of new life ♫ ♫ with the power to stand ♫ ♫ Crossing the border ♫ 
 oh 
And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said, "You know what, we're getting out of that business. 
you know
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century, that scarcity started to get eroded -- and I don't mean by digital technology; I mean by analog technology. 
i mean
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was, look, if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends, that is not a crime. That's okay. 
okay
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. 
okay
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them, that's not okay. 
okay
When you look at the people who co-signed on the SOPA bill, people who've co-signed on PIPA, what you see is that they have cumulatively received from the traditional media industries. 
you see
And if you're not an American citizen, you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. 
you know
They just want the sharing to go away. 
 just 
Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch, just consuming -- not producing, not sharing -- and we should say, "No." 
 just 
The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined. We need to find an alternative. 
 just 
Now, combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric — Actually, extreme green for us is all three together; that's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that. 
you see
That's already a well established entity, they don't need another entry. 
well
So, in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously, and on the right hand side you'll see algae. 
you see
One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here, and what you see on the other side is our species — we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus. 
you see
We use open pond systems. Now, around the world they are growing algae, with this racetrack design that you see here. Looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well, but when it gets around the last turn, which I call turn four — it's stagnant. 
well
Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer. 
 just 
Fish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies, that we've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to seawater. 
 as a matter of fact 
Well, we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab. 
well
What you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing, a macro-algae that I'll talk about in a minute. 
you see
And lastly, it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work, I don't just talk about what I do. 
 just 
It's there for 10 years; it's working very well. 
well
This is a macro-algae that loves excess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks. 
you know
Oh, I thought it was funny.  And at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense, this is a logical snack. You have mustard, you are a seaman, you see the halophyte, you mix it together, it's a great snack with some crackers. 
you see
I say, "I'm okay with that, 'cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers, which is significant." 
okay
And the reason why you see red, red and yellow, is a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday — This is a picture taken on Saturday. 
you see
There are no cars around, but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday.  This is a proof to you that I'm working. 
you see
Because, you might ask, how do we find the real you, how do you know what the real you is? 
you know
Well, I'm not quite sure. 
well
You know, people are very wedded to these, actually. 
you know
People put them on their Facebook profile as though they are meaningul, you even know your Chinese horoscope as well. 
well
Well, that's the idea I want to challenge. 
well
And I have to say now, I'll say it a bit later, but I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird, the challenge actually has a very, very long and distinguished history. 
 just 
We have sensations and experiences as well. 
well
It's not just intellectual things. 
 just 
Strange thought? Well, maybe not. 
well
Well, clearly there are memories, desires, intentions, sensations, and so forth. 
well
And so really, there are all these things, like beliefs, desires, sensations, experiences, they're all related to each other, and that just is you. 
 just 
Because I just invite you to think about, by comparison, think about pretty much anything else in the universe, maybe apart from the very most fundamental forces or powers. 
 just 
Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts, but somehow being a separate, permanent entity which has those parts? 
 just 
It's not that we don't exist, it's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there. 
 just 
Well, a lot of people actually do use this talk of illusion and so forth. 
well
The fact that we are, in some ways, just this very, very complex collection, ordered collection of things, does not mean we're not real. 
 just 
The true self, as it were then, is not something that is just there for you to discover, you don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self, What you are partly doing, at least, is actually creating your true self. 
 just 
This is the Buddha, again: "Well-makers lead the water, fletchers bend the arrow, carpenters bend a log of wood, wise people fashion themselves." 
well
They have been around for almost 30 years now, which is quite amazing to think of, but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena. 
 just 
So it's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products. 
 just 
You can just make it physically on the spot. 
 just 
I'm not sure about you guys, but I've had experiences when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that I know where I want to sit in my house and I just can't find the right thing, or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself. 
 just 
And you don't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization, you can use it for functional customization, scanning parts of the body and creating things that are made to fit. 
 just 
You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree. 
you know
But with MRI data, we can just build the product, as you can see, very intricately. 
 just 
So just to finalize, we're all individual. 
 just 
I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. 
i mean
By the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time. 
by the way
We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking. 
 just 
And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. 
 just 
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is, but what was going on inside of your mind. 
 just 
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them. 
 just 
Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this. 
 just 
Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk? 
you know
I went to Afghanistan in 2005 to work on a Financial Times piece, and there I met Kamila, a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context. 
 just 
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice." 
i mean
 So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business? 
you know
And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive, these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many. 
 just 
I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, "You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby So maybe you could interview her." 
you know
And she was just the start. 
 just 
If you see the word "microfinance," what comes to mind? 
you see
And if you see the word "entrepreneur," most people think men. 
you see
And that's just to start. 
 just 
You know why? 
you know
So you see, this is not about doing good, this is about global growth and global employment. 
you see
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons. 
 just 
We can make a difference, and make a difference, not just for women, but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. 
 just 
But for a moment, just think about the last time that you ordered something online. 
 just 
So deep in the middle of that picture, you see a classic pick-pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. 
you see
So we said, there's just got to be a better way to do this. 
 just 
And I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker, or my vision for how it should work. 
 just 
Well, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise, probably a technique that many of you use, It's this notion of testing your ideas. 
well
And I said, "Hold on, zero dollars per hour, what I would do is 'hire' 10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m., walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. 
 just 
If I need it, I'll call you, otherwise just stand there. 
 just 
Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies? 
you see
So they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order. 
 just 
But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. 
 just 
So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day. 
you see
In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that's where the pick stations were. 
you see
So I'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker's actual day in the life of. 
 just 
And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online, you break it open and the goo is in there, you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. 
 just 
Well, we were talking about the human mind this morning. 
well
In other words, a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control. 
well
It takes good equipment and well-trained, dedicated soldiers. 
well
Because she makes an active contribution to a better world, just like all of us here today. 
 just 
And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year, and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again. 
 just 
That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor. 
you see
Every night I fall asleep very well, and I am, I repeat, the happiest man in the world, and I'm thankful I am alive. 
well
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed. 
 just 
I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed? 
you see
And you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn. 
 just 
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain. 
 just 
That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot. 
you know
Because maybe we can glean information, not just how to move people up to the average, but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide. 
 just 
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause. 
 just 
I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there. 
well
Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you, I felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom. 
 just 
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world. 
by the way
So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week. 
well
And into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school, but that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week. 
well
Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. 
 just 
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. 
 just 
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery. 
well
So it runs frequently, the entire hospital, just on a generator. 
 just 
It's not just inappropriate, it becomes really unsafe. 
 just 
And everything began well until the power went out. 
well
And after umpteen surgeries and, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy, he just said, "That's it. I'm done. That's enough. 
 um
So he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them -- I think that's the scientific term -- and he just started tinkering. 
 just 
It's just a reality of anesthesia. The lungs can be paralyzed. 
 just 
And so we've just added this manual bellows. 
 just 
So in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment, just like the first machine I showed you. 
 just 
Well we've seen good results so far. 
well
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries, and since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events. 
well
One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. 
 just 
But you know, it's just one of so many ways that design, appropriate design, can have an impact on health outcomes. 
you know
If more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low-income countries could start their design process, their solution search, from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital -- in other words, if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world, rather than the one that we wished existed -- we might just save a lot of lives. 
 just 
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important. 
well
And what you see, for example, if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment, and then if you ask people where it was, but you've made the environment bigger, where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out. 
you see
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between. 
well
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex, which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats. 
you see
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains. 
 just 
If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example, we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go. 
 just 
Say this person approaching here, and they say, "Well is this a suicide bomber or not? 
well
If this person doesn't follow directions, then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterward either, yes, we shot the right person, or, no, this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on. 
 just 
So if they had non-lethal weapons then they would say, "Well we can use them in that sort of situation. 
well
So again, they would say, "Well if we have access to non-lethal weapons, if we've got someone we know is hostile, we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place, at least, again, we're not going to kill them." 
well
And so the suggestion is, well hey, if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this, maybe it would be a good idea, again, with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person, again, they haven't actually killed them. 
well
The one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them. 
 just 
And anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way. 
 just 
And they're thinking, well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area, if the crowd is being hostile. 
well
They generally seem to think, "Well, why would we care what's happened with the police? 
well
As you can see from the fine print, if you can read it at the top: "Police shooting deaths" means not just people who have been shot by police, but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police. 
 just 
This person is not doing anything violent, but they just won't do what we want them to. 
 just 
Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying, "Well hey, there might be some problems" -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on. 
well
Another problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use non-lethal weapons and get trained about them and then get tested and so on. 
 just 
And eventually she said to him "Well I'm going to get back in my car." 
well
"She was running away. What else was I suppose to do?" 
i suppose
Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States, it happened in Canada as well. 
well
Okay. 
okay
The last thing that I would just like to say, when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like, they almost inevitably say the same thing. 
 just 
They say, "Well, it's got to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon. 
well
So I think, yes, there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations, but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well. 
well
Now I remember a few years ago, a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here, president of Qatar University -- who, by the way, is a woman -- he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way. 
by the way
 Not that you do; I'm just saying. 
 just 
 My point is here, people have a choice -- just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono. 
 just 
You know, art and culture is big business. 
you know
We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists, and Arabs who are not Muslims -- not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution. 
by the way
 Now this museum is just as important to us as the West. 
 just 
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration. 
 just 
 Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up? 
you know
They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage and realizing we're just as different and just the same as each other. 
 just 
 Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know. 
you know
So I'll just give you my message up front: Try not to go extinct. 
 just 
And I usually just say, "Well dinosaurs were big, different and gone." 
well
Well that's not true, but we'll get to the goose in a minute. 
well
 Well, go to a museum, you'll see, see how many baby dinosaurs there are. 
well
I mean, if they'd have just taken that, taken Peter Dodson's work, and gone on with that, then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have. 
 just 
They're very well taken care of. 
well
And there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct. 
i mean
But if you line them up, if you just take those three skulls and just line them up, they line up like this. 
 just 
I mean, it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast. 
i mean
What's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well. 
well
So just with these three dinosaurs, you can easily -- as a scientist -- we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal. 
 just 
 Okay. 
okay
And I said, "Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses?" 
well
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. 
i mean
So we can just keep doing this. 
 just 
But I didn't have to cut any of them really, because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14. 
 just 
And we just went out and looked at other people's collections and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth. 
 just 
She said, "On the day before I started university, I was in the hotel room with my mom and dad, and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this, that I wasn't ready for university, that I just burst into tears. 
 just 
They were like, "We know you're scared, but let's just go tomorrow, go to the first day, and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this, that's fine; tell us, and we'll take you home. 
 just 
I was in line for registration, and I looked around and just knew I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready. 
 just 
All of the sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped. 
 just 
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this."  "I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop. 
 just 
You're just one of the people who hasn't been told. 
 just 
No, I'm just joking. 
 just 
So for example, in the United Kingdom, the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation. 
 just 
 Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well that I would be talking about pesticides, that I'd be talking about public health, because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful. 
well
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well, that there's nothing more painful than childbirth -- which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that -- but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five. 
well
But just two weeks before that, the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. 
 just 
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals -- one of our big inventions was the placenta. 
i mean
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to. 
you see
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known, that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen, PCBs, DDT cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby's in the womb. 
 just 
And that's something that's just profound and sad, but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this. 
 just 
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'" The truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future" 
well
But for the men here, I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk. 
 just 
It's not just my work in amphibians, but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe, holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats, an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well. 
well
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans, but just by coincidence, my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine. 
 just 
These are just men who live in an agricultural community. 
 just 
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to. 
 just 
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us, just like Rachel Carson and others have warned. 
 just 
And my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps, but it's also about our children as well. 
well
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore. 
you know
I mean, look, it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work. 
i mean
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. 
well
The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy; we just have to be thinner than our partners. 
 just 
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising, we just need to wait for them to get fat, maybe bake a few pies. 
 just 
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous. 
 just 
And theoretically, I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash, we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good. 
i suppose
Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse -- a list that includes visitation rights in jail, but hopefully you'll never need that one. 
well
For instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing okay. 
okay
But just in case, I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon. 
 just 
Basking sharks are awesome creatures. They are just magnificent. 
 just 
They used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks. 
well
There was someone recently, wasn't there? Just a couple weeks ago. 
 just 
It was a well-documented fishery, and as you can see here, it peaked in the 50s where they were killing 1,500 sharks a year. 
well
And they killed about 12,000 sharks in this period, literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay at Achill Island. 
 just 
I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man, just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably come to the surface to "bask." 
 just 
We also deployed a couple of satellite tags, so we did use hi-tech stuff as well. 
well
But in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the Equator as well. 
well
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are. 
 just 
And you see that this work was done in 2006. 
you see
You're thinking, "That's just ridiculous. No way." 
 just 
Well one obvious source is dead sharks, Dead sharks washed up. 
well
This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas, illegally, because you're not allowed to do that under E.U. law, and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak. 
 just 
And we would use conventional methods -- I have a crossbow, you see the crossbow in my hand there, which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well. 
well
All it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong. 
 just 
And I thought, "Hey, you know, I can build on this." 
you know
So we thought, okay, we're going to try to get out and get some slime. 
okay
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see, here's a shark that's running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime. 
you see
But hey, sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come. 
 just 
So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounters with these animals. 
 just 
And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can. 
 just 
If you're more interested, we have a basking shark website now just set up. 
 just 
We have just published an evaluation of this program, and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable. 
 just 
The collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing. 
 just 
And these incredibly beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history, the Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape, and so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage, but also an important part of our cultural heritage. 
 just 
In the North, the boreal is bordered by the tundra, and just below that, in Yukon, we have this incredible valley, the Tombstone Valley. 
 just 
Well, the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected, and is potentially, could be potentially, exploited for gas and mineral rights. 
well
Now, you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well. 
well
Now, here you see -- of course, as you go further on, these trucks become like a pixel. 
you see
And this is just one of a number of mines, 10 mines so far right now. 
 just 
SemCrude, just one of the licensees, in just one of their tailings ponds, dumps 250,000 tons of this toxic gunk every single day. 
 just 
And you can see in the context, it's just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes and another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon. 
 just 
And of course, these tailings ponds -- well, you can't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these, so maybe we should stop calling them ponds -- these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River. 
well
And as a parent, I just can't imagine what that does to your soul. 
 just 
Here you see the route down the Mackenzie Valley. 
you see
So the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there, within a few miles we go from these dry boreal forests of 100-year-old trees, maybe 10 inches across, and soon we're in the coastal temperate rainforest, rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees, 20 feet across, a completely different ecosystem. 
 just 
Some of the greatest densities of, some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet, and yet there's a proposal, of course, to build a pipeline to take huge tankers, 10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez, through some of the most difficult to navigate waters in the world, where only just a few years ago, a B.C. ferry ran aground. 
 just 
And I quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in Canada. 
 just 
The tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal. 
 just 
And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. 
you see
Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well. 
well
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran. 
you see
In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill. 
you know
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder. 
well
It's funny, my wife, Daisy, whose family is littered with schizophrenics -- and I mean littered with them -- once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God. 
i mean
Finally, after about 10 years of alienating friends and strangers alike, I finally got it, a new personal truth all my own, that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that I was gaining, I'd better find a different way of going about it. 
well
That it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual, but leads to real change. 
 just 
Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire, I mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity. 
i mean
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart is by far the most --   it's by far the most well-documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy. 
well
It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true. 
 just 
And just like that, you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses. 
 just 
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work, you should really Google him -- Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground, where finally the other kid says to him, "Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad," to which Hicks replies, "Really? How soon?" 
well
Not for God, not for country, not for profit -- just as a basic metric for global decision-making. 
 just 
So my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny, because you might just find the question that you've been looking for. 
 just 
Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago, markets did well. 
well
We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance. 
well
They're just too lazy. 
 just 
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join. 
 just 
We have one person -- well, actually we're going to slice him in half because it's less than one percent. 
well
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted. 
well
Christmas is coming, we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know. 
well
Well, you still have choice. 
well
Whether you think about immediate gratification, and the chocolates versus bananas, it's just painful to save now. It's a lot more fun to spend now. 
 just 
Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future, let's say every January you're going to be saving more automatically and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401 plan before you see it, before you touch it, before you get the issue of immediate gratification. 
you see
Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January. 
well
And there's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because I don't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum. 
 just 
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. 
 just 
This is just one example. 
 just 
Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university.  And, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing for her to think, because I told her I was working in computer security, and it was interesting to get her perspective. 
you know
1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted, hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there, and the technology has continued to move forward. 
you see
Well, in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol, and they built the device you see pictured here, with a little antenna, that could talk the protocol to the device, and thus control it. 
well
Okay, let me shift gears and show you another target. 
okay
Well, that's what the researchers that I'm going to talk about today did. 
well
That software has to receive and decode the radio signal, and then figure out what to do with it, even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio, and that software that does that decoding, if it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car. 
 just 
They bought two cars, and I guess they have better budgets than I do. 
i guess
Okay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car, they get to mess around with it, and then they leave, and now, what kind of trouble are you in? 
okay
Now you might say, "Okay, that's silly." 
okay
Well, what if you make the car always say it's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going? 
well
Well, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software, something like that. 
well
These are ones where I went to a conference, and my mind was just blown, and I said, "I have to share this with other people." 
 just 
This was Fabian Monrose's lab at the University of North Carolina, and what they did was something intuitive once you see it, but kind of surprising. 
you see
What you see here in number one is a reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone that they're typing in. 
you see
You see the difference? 
you see
Well, they found the names and information about confidential informants. They found information that was being recorded in wiretaps, a bunch of crimes that were being discussed, sensitive information. 
well
The last one I thought was really, really cool, and I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something that you're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators, but it's stealing keystrokes. 
 just 
Why does this matter? Well, in the Android platform, for example, the developers have a manifest where every device on there, the microphone, etc., has to register if you're going to use it so that hackers can't take over it, but nobody controls the accelerometer. 
well
So what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to someone's keyboard, and just leave the room, and then later recover what they did, even without using the microphone. 
 just 
Well, I think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget. 
well
In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. 
well
Well, from that discussion grew this program that involved 2,700 scientists from more than 80 countries around the world who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions at a combined cost of 650 million dollars to study the distribution, diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean. 
well
I want you to notice the scale on the slide, because when you see the same picture from the 1980s, we see the fish are much smaller and we're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish. 
you see
And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light. 
well
Well what they found was mislabeled fish. 
well
Now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic, in the North Sea in particular, and also the east coast of North America fairly well. 
well
Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that. 
well
And what we find if we plot up the well-known species is this sort of a distribution. 
well
Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species. 
 just 
And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you. 
 just 
So we've done pretty well. 
well
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are. 
 just 
Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with, as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs. 
well
This is not a philosophical statement, this is just science based in physics, chemistry and biology. 
 just 
So when I say full, I mean really full -- well past any margin for error, well past any dispute about methodology. 
well
That the crazy idea is just that, it is crazy, and with the Earth full, it's game over. 
 just 
Well, it's mostly true. 
well
The problem is we're just warming up this growth engine. 
 just 
China plans to be there in just 20 years. 
 just 
Mother nature doesn't negotiate; she just sets rules and describes consequences. 
 just 
But the idea that we can gently grow there is just wrong, and it's dangerously wrong, because it means we're not getting ready for what's really going to happen. 
 just 
Let's just think through that idea. 
 just 
In my view, it is well underway. 
well
But let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen. 
 just 
You see, those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem, that technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good, are in fact right. 
you see
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry, and from there to rationing of food and energy. 
 just 
Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done. 
 just 
Think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy. 
 just 
Scientists like James Hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades. I wanted to know what that would take, so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway to find the answer. 
 just 
To my surprise, eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap, not very cheap, but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization. 
 just 
Well it's time to grow up, to be wiser, to be calmer, to be more considered. 
well
However, the vehicles you see here are big. 
you see
So let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work. 
 just 
So in this picture, you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower. 
you see
So on the left, you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air, and it shows you how robust the control is. 
you see
Well, robots like this have many applications. 
well
So here, you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum, and then changes its orientation and then recovers. 
you see
So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum, and then does this pirouette, this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers, this robot is basically doing that. 
 just 
 So once you know how to fly in formation, you can actually pick up objects cooperatively. 
you know
So this just shows that we can double, triple, quadruple the robots' strength, by just getting them to team with neighbors, as you can see here. 
 just 
So in this video you see -- and it's sped up 10, 14 times -- you see three different structures being built by these robots. 
you see
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes, "You see this bar? 
you see
"You see that stone wall out there? 
you see
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold. 
 just 
"You see that pier on the lake out there? 
you see
And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment, which is "Make me care" -- please, emotionally, intellectually, aesthetically, just make me care. 
 just 
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels, just switching channel after channel, and then suddenly you actually stop on one. 
 just 
And the most current story lesson that I've had was completing the film I've just done this year in 2012. 
 just 
A well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end. 
well
They just don't want to know that they're doing that. 
 just 
It's this well-organized absence of information that draws us in. 
well
It's not just that they're damn cute; it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are. 
 just 
She believed that all well-drawn characters have a spine. 
well
In our earliest days at Pixar, before we truly understood the invisible workings of story, we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts. 
 just 
That just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story. 
 just 
And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines, not hard, fast rules. 
 just 
And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace. 
well
I could just tell there was a grand design under it -- in every shot, every scene, every line. 
 just 
Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on. 
 just 
Here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him, but underneath it was a constant, a guideline, a road map. 
 just 
A strong theme is always running through a well-told story. 
well
For me, there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling -- to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder. 
 just 
It's okay, daddy's here. 
okay
Use what you know. Draw from it. 
you know
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century. 
well
All of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under way. 
well
The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured, until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean. 
well
As you see, there's a high correlation between temperature, CO2 and sea level. 
you see
A warmer ocean releases CO2, just as a warm Coca-Cola does. 
 just 
if global warming continues, will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world, the Midwest and Great Plains, which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts, worse than the Dust Bowl, within just a few decades, if we let global warming continue. 
 just 
So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm. 
you know
So, for example, one of your great excuses is:  "Well, great careers are really and truly, for most people, just a matter of luck. So I'm going to stand around, I'm going to try to be lucky, and if I'm lucky, I'll have a great career. 
well
Now, you see, if this was 1950, being completely competent -- that would have given you a great career. 
you see
And then, of course, another excuse: "Well, I would do this, I would do this, but, but -- well, after all, I'm not weird. 
well
Everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive. A little strange. Hmm? Hmm? Okay? 
okay
You know, a fine line between madness and genius. 
you know
You know what? Here's a little secret: You want to work? You want to work really, really, really hard? 
you know
You know what? You'll succeed. 
you know
"Well, I have an interest." 
well
"Well, I'm interested in this." 
well
She left the room After he got over his surprise at being, you know, turned down, he concluded he'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person. 
you know
And if you don't find the highest expression of your talent, if you settle for "interesting," what the hell ever that means, do you know what will happen at the end of your long life? 
you know
You know what will happen someday, you ideal parent, you? 
you know
You are so happy. It's the conversation a parent wants to hear, because your kid's good in math, and you know you're going to like what comes next. 
you know
You know what you're going to say? 
you know
Why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion? 
you see
You know why. 
you know
In your heart of hearts, you know why, and I'm being deadly serious. 
you know
You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships. 
you know
It is because you are -- you know what you are. 
you know
 Okay, here's another question: Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand. 
okay
Okay, that's the majority. 
okay
It's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away. 
 just 
JH: So note how Bradley's petty, moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase. 
 just 
It just means ordinary or common. 
 just 
I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human. 
 just 
When we climb that staircase, self-interest fades away, we become just much less self-interested, and we feel as though we are better, nobler and somehow uplifted. 
 just 
Is it a product of natural selection, Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience, it's just a mistake? 
 just 
Well many scientists who study religion take this view. 
well
I mean, these things sound trite, but they are deep evolutionary truths. 
i mean
The main argument against group selection has always been that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators, but as soon as you have a group of cooperators, they're just going to get taken over by free-riders, individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others. 
well
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other, they work together, they generate wealth. 
well
We start with just one green, and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food. 
 just 
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria. 
 just 
And the most cohesive hives won, just as Darwin said. 
 just 
Okay, so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way. 
okay
I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects, people and ideas. 
i mean
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft. 
 just 
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. 
 just 
This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum. 
well
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. 
 just 
Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. 
 just 
And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability. 
 just 
 And she said, "Well, I think it's too late." 
well
 And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit." 
 just 
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable think, "God, vulnerability is weakness." 
 just 
And I've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest. 
to be honest
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector: innovation, creativity and change. 
to be honest
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six. 
 just 
So you know what I did? I made it." 
you know
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!" 
 just 
You know what the big secret about TED is? 
you know
I guess I'm doing it right now. 
i guess
 You know why this place is amazing? 
you know
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?" 
you see
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher!"  But he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work. 
 just 
Raise your hand if you think you know. 
you know
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back. 
 just 
You're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute, what you're looking for to make it happen. 
 just 
But when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas, because you have plenty of natural gas. 
well
TBP: Well you say a big investor. 
well
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up, but Jim and I talked there as he left, and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?" 
well
And he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is." 
well
They just aren't, it's a bad deal. 
 just 
I mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times, they went ahead and did it anyway. 
i mean
You can't -- okay. 
okay
 CA: We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know. 
you know
I mean seriously, the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking. 
i mean
I've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life. 
well
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas in that aquifer. 
well
Your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately, that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive? 
i guess
We have so much natural gas, a day will not come where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore." 
well
TBP: I lost 150 million on the wind, okay. 
okay
Because the personal, as you know, is political. 
you know
And one of the things that you see is that male line, the mortality is going down, down, down, down, down. 
you see
And you see the female line since 1984, the gap is widening. 
you see
So what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, which had been developed in men, by men, for men for the last 50 years -- and they work pretty well in men, don't they? -- weren't working so well for women. 
well
Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up and said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor," and it was okay to talk about it. 
okay
And they're just passed. 
 just 
Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative that went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, which is the cardiology part of the NIH. 
well
So in the WISE, 15 years ago, we started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that." 
well
So we picked up on that and we said, "You know, we now have the ability with these special catheters called IVUS: intravascular ultrasound." 
you know
Right here, it's just a focal -- right there. 
 just 
Men just have to dump it in a single area." 
 just 
She's just laid it down nice and tidy. 
 just 
Well once again, women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem. 
well
And it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease, And when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like Barbara in the movie -- they get treated. 
 just 
And one of the the cutting-edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy. 
 just 
Okay, so here's where we started. 
okay
So just like the breast cancer story, doing research, getting awareness going, it works, you just have to get it going. 
 just 
And I would propose, with the better longevity that women have overall, that women probably should theoretically do better, if we could just get treated. 
 just 
So you may ask --  You may ask me, well how do you know what our energy future is? 
well
Well I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old. 
well
Now most of you are probably saying, well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion. 
well
Well it doesn't break even. 
well
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage, so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians. 
by the way
And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about. 
 just 
I mean, let's let the reader do a little work. 
i mean
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class, and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing," which I found both erroneous and profound. 
you know
 So I like to at least pretend it just flows out. 
 just 
Poetry just says a few things in different ways. 
 just 
The next poem is called forgetfulness, and it's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage. 
 just 
It has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall, well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. 
well
I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house, because the mice might get into them and start a fire. 
 just 
It took a long time -- I mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage -- a long time to put those two together. 
i mean
 I mean, we had the wheel for some time. 
i mean
 I just have time to read a more recent poem to you. 
 just 
So never mind; you're fine just being yourself. 
 just 
You're loved for just being you. 
 just 
But did you know that at your age Judy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture, Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room -- no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator? 
you know
We think you're special just being you -- playing with your food and staring into space. 
 just 
 By the way, I lied about Schubert doing the dishes, but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house." 
by the way
And we have some wizard technology which I think has worked really well, and over the course of the time I've worked in intensive care, the death rate for males in Australia has halved, and intensive care has had something to do with that. 
well
I thought, "Okay. Take this steady." 
okay
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me, "You know, we always thought there'd be time." 
you know
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us, and the stress created in families by dying is enormous, and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else, so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you've got a choice. 
 just 
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore. 
 just 
The dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people. 
 just 
Enjoying it so far?   Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here. 
 just 
You know, historically, we didn't do that. 
you know
I'm sorry to say that.  What we did, anyway, look, what we did, we didn't just take this lying down at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere. 
 just 
She's the one he's looking at, and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that? 
you see
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice, and that this is how things should work. 
 just 
So here's the pitch: I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up, particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and ICU has less and less and less to offer us. 
 just 
One of them is, you can, just ask this simple question. This question never fails. 
 just 
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation, so if you just replace all these words of birth, I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option. 
 just 
The electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago. 
 just 
You see, the battery is the key enabling device here. 
you see
And you know, if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation, we can't just conserve our way out; we can't just drill our way out; we can't bomb our way out. 
you know
So let's abandon the paradigm of let's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product. 
 just 
And just a few short years following their discovery, aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material. 
 just 
Everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here. 
you see
You know, I've got to tell you, one of the greatest benefits of being a professor: colored chalk. 
you know
This is that student, David Bradwell, who, in this image, appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work. 
well
We've operated over 400 of these, perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries -- not just magnesium and antimony. 
 just 
I'm just saying. 
 just 
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime, and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound. 
you see
If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach, a hummingbird would take, well, days. 
well
And it's not just passive structures, it's entire machines. 
 just 
Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months, and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever. 
 just 
Sometimes we just forget. 
 just 
I guess in some way, I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard. 
i guess
But there isn't anyone else; there's just you. 
 just 
RD: Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this. 
well
RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right. 
well
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera. 
 just 
RD: So I mean, in part, we wondered if it was possible to do it. 
i mean
So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing, but when things looks just natural, you also don't see them. 
 just 
CA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance. 
 just 
I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here? 
i mean
It's just the nature of what we do. 
 just 
CA: I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader. 
i mean
Do you wake up in the night sometimes, just asking questions of your team's brilliance? 
 just 
RD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right. 
well
She'd lie beside me and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well. 
well
It's disheartening, it's sad. And then someone asked me, just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago, "So where is the hope?" 
 just 
Right now in Liberia, what do you see as the main issue that troubles you? 
you see
But sadly, the vision of a great future, or the dream of a great future, is just a dream, because you have all of these vices. 
 just 
So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place, and I just don't want to be the only one at this place. 
 just 
And maybe, just maybe, saying, "Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today." 
 just 
Without it, a script is just words. 
 just 
Augmented reality is just the latest technology. 
 just 
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity. 
 just 
I just become skanky. 
 just 
("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper. 
you know
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine,  and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast --  -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters --  and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur. 
 just 
And then I just threw some typography on it. 
 just 
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it. 
 just 
Well, they used it. 
well
Do you know what John Updike used to do of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf? 
you know
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different. 
 just 
Well, again and again, what we find as we look around the world in our little tour of the world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops. 
well
Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale, using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track farming on a global scale. 
well
That area's about 30 million square kilometers, or about an Africa's worth of land, a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course, is what you see. And what's left is, like, the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia, or the middle of a rain forest. 
you see
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s, this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought, kind of an average day, it looks something like this. 
well
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water and using it to grow food, and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado, it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean. 
well
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world. 
well
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side, you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand, feeding this basin with water. 
you see
Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not, in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union. 
well
Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen? 
well
You see the canal they dug? 
you see
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to. 
well
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous, we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat, which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does. 
well
Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to double global ag production around the world? 
well
Well, we could try to farm more land. 
well
The green areas here show where corn yields, just showing corn as an example, are already really high, probably the maximum you could find on Earth today for that climate and soil, but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get. 
 just 
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America, but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries used to be, is still a mess agriculturally. 
you see
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me, "Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food, local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills -- and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here, but not any one of these is a silver bullet. 
well
Let's just take one country in Africa, Senegal. 
 just 
But they said, as I left home -- and I literally went down the front steps, down the porch at home -- and they said, "Even though you've had this great education, if you decide to get married and have kids right away, that's OK by us, too." 
 ok 
Maybe some of you know that feeling. 
you know
It means that parents have the ability to affect the future, not just accept it as it is. 
 just 
In Germany, this transition started in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years for family size to stabilize in this country. 
 just 
And so when I asked her why, she simply said, "Well, because I couldn't run my business if I had another child." 
well
CA: Some people on the right in America and in many conservative cultures around the world might say something like this: "It's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on. 
well
It just means that they're getting to make choices about their lives. 
 just 
Tell your story about how contraception has either changed your life or somebody's life that you know. 
you know
We need a groundswell of people saying, "This makes sense. 
well
And, you know, the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive. 
you know
 MG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things. I have so many follow-up questions. 
 oh 
And I thought it was just an amazing day. 
 just 
If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life, I would have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, the Chinese equivalency exam, and I was going to go study law in Beijing, and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations 
 just 
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Going back to Harlan ♫ That sound was just so beautiful, the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo. 
 just 
And everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads. 
 just 
It's just incredible. 
 just 
And in that moment, we weren't our American selves, we weren't our Chinese selves, we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here. 
 just 
I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone. 
well
And I found these maps which you see here. 
you see
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here. 
you see
Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well. 
well
This is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images. 
 just 
And within this accumulation of images and texts, I'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself. 
 just 
I mean, most of us were raised to believe that the word "universe" means everything. 
i mean
And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right. 
 just 
Okay, part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us, establishing that space itself is stretching, it's expanding. 
okay
Similarly, the astronomers' results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize, but they raised an analogous question. 
well
Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's. 
well
You see, we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing, pulls objects together. 
you see
How? Well according to Einstein's math, if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy, sort of like a uniform, invisible mist, then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive, repulsive gravity, which is just what we need to explain the observations. 
well
Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail of interest to experts, but of no relevance to anybody else. 
 just 
Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter. 
well
Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality, and this peculiar number may be doing just that, as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes -- an idea that naturally emerges from string theory, which takes me to part two: string theory. 
 just 
And just like the strings on a violin, they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. 
 just 
Well some researchers lost heart, concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each giving rise to different physical features, string theory would never make definitive, testable predictions. 
well
Because you see, if there are other universes, and if those universes each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions, then the physical features of each universe will be different, and in particular, the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. 
you see
In this context, the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number, there are many numbers. 
 just 
And in those universes that have much less dark energy, well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that, again, galaxies don't form. 
well
So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. 
well
And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they're so cold that, again, our form of life would not take hold. 
well
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang, we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward. 
you see
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. 
well
You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expanding, that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. 
you see
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. 
 just 
The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible. 
 just 
BG: Well it's hard to say. 
well
Holy cow! That's just amazing. 
 just 
So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten, but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future. 
 just 
 EP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional, but it was not easy to get there. 
okay
 EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that, but it's not like that everywhere. 
okay
So every time you see a concrete jungle like that, what you've got to do is find open spaces. 
you see
All the lines, the colored lines you see there, it's our high-capacity transportation network. 
you see
I mean, favelas can sometimes really be a solution, if you deal with them, if you put public policy inside the favelas. 
i mean
Let me just show a map of Rio again. 
 just 
So you see, they are spread all over the city. 
you see
You see the contrast between the rich and poor. 
you see
This was an old building in a favela in Rio -- [unclear favela name] -- that we just transformed into a primary school, with high quality. 
 just 
We just had last week Carnivale. 
 just 
You see just a little bit of moisture around the city. 
you see
EP: Okay, how's the traffic? 
okay
Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine. 
well
You see, the streets are clear. 
you see
EP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services. 
okay
Public services working well. 
well
EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much. 
okay
 Okay, so no files, this place, no paperwork, no distance, 24/7 working. 
okay
Texting: I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting, a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see -- hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else -- or trying to translate the abbreviations LOL, LMAO, HMU. 
you see
But I just started again an hour ago." 
 just 
Kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there's nowhere else to turn that they're sending them to us. 
 just 
No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly. 
 just 
Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals. 
 just 
The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work. 
 just 
And they found things like, when you see crystal meth on the street, if you add police presence, you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen. 
you see
JS: Okay. Wet hands. 
okay
You know the funny thing is, I get my hands drier than people do with three or four, because they can't get in between the cracks. 
you know
How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off. 
 just 
Or maybe you're in your living room, you know, playing with the Wii with the kids, or something like that, and, you know, there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about. 
you know
But we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable, but let's just think about this. 
 just 
I mean, people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly. 
i mean
And so this was just an amazing experience. 
 just 
Or, you know, if anybody here is from Boston -- So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after, I believe, 351 years, when they won the World Series, it was amazing. 
you know
Or the houses, you'd come out, because every game, well, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right? 
well
But it's okay, it's the Red Sox, right? 
okay
I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox, and we know where they're stacked. 
i mean
So this was an amazing experience, and again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles, people didn't say -- you know, really, "I can die now because the Red Sox won." And many people did. 
you know
I was the head of a college department teaching games, so, again, it was sort of a real job, and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them. 
 just 
And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department, is to eat, and I did that very well, and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson. 
well
Can you imagine? Now let's, we can see that's a traditional Native American. Now I just want to change that guy's race. 
 just 
up there to photograph it, but when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth about this question. Do you take the picture or not? 
 just 
Because we just make things that are fun or, you know, will make you feel fear, you know, that visceral excitement. 
you know
And I thought, that's it? And so, you know, this is the Middle Passage, this is an incredibly significant event, and she's treating it like, basically some black people went on a cruise, is more or less how it sounds to her.  And so, to me, I wanted more value in this, so when she asked if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."  And so I happened to have all of these little pieces. 
you know
And she realizes, you know, we don't have enough food, and so she asks what to do, and I say, "Well, we can either" -- Remember, she's seven -- "We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side." 
well
And she -- just the look on her face came over and she said -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month, right? 
 just 
"But what if I saw them? You know, couldn't we stay together?" "No." 
you know
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience. 
 just 
And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, but, and it is obviously with Mexicans too, but it's much more than that. 
you know
We conventionally divide space into private and public realms, and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space. 
well
I mean, this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade. 
i mean
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side. 
 just 
It may just be a place for civic commiseration. 
 just 
Well there's always the hole. 
well
It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction. 
 just 
And we said, well the first erection would take one week. 
well
And I'm just going to zip through these slides. 
 just 
So flexible interior for discussions, just like this, but in the round -- luminous and reconfigurable. 
 just 
You see, fire made us human; fossil fuels made us modern. 
you see
But today's energy system is not just inefficient, it is also disconnected, aging, dirty and insecure. 
 just 
So in reinventing fire, we integrated all four sectors that use energy -- transportation, buildings, industry and electricity -- and we integrated four kinds of innovation, not just technology and policy, but also design and business strategy. 
 just 
And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency. 
 just 
But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds. 
 just 
Instead of just seeing the travel grow, we can use innovative pricing, charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon. 
 just 
And the most biofuel we might need, just three million barrels a day, can be made two-thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate. 
 just 
And the long transition is already well under way. 
well
And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends. 
 just 
And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. 
 just 
But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy, not by getting better pumps, but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes with fat, short, straight pipes. 
 just 
Well, from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses, only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow. 
well
In fact, these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart. 
 just 
Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company. 
 just 
Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost. 
well
Well that's what's actually happened so far. 
well
So to solve the energy problem, we just needed to enlarge it. 
 just 
Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions, both driven by modern efficiency, and you get the really big story: reinventing fire, where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050, saving 5 trillion dollars, growing the economy 2.6-fold, strengthening out national security, oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal, reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent. 
by the way
I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity, but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species. 
 just 
So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com, let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you, to help make the world richer, fairer, cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. 
 just 
Usually I like working in my shop, but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river, then I just love it. 
 just 
Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave? 
you see
Eight hundred two-liter soda bottles -- oh yea. 
 oh 
Tule is a reed that's native to California, and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious. 
 just 
Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer? 
you know
What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world? 
 just 
It sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth, and I'll tell you why. 
you know
And I'm just going to come out and say it: My daughter is not a wave. 
 just 
And you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back, the cycles of hunger and eating, waking and sleeping, laughing and crying would emerge as pattern." 
 just 
RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation -- like literally two raindrops falling, and just watching that pattern is so stunning. 
well
And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff. 
 just 
And I happened to have a friend who was over, and he said, "Why don't you just wait." 
 just 
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes, and two, it does not look like as expected. 
i guess
Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us. 
well
 But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us, it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world. 
 just 
The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion and it's an experimental browser add-on that you can install in your Firefox browser that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you. 
you see
The red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that I have not navigated to, but are following me. 
you see
Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. 
 just 
Sometimes you just want to stand there silently, alone with your thoughts. 
 just 
Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window. 
 just 
What we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity, but one of them makes you feel great and the other one, with just a small change of posture, makes you feel terrible. 
 just 
You know, pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health and you're merely feeling a mug. 
you know
You know my example of the Eurostar. 
you know
What they don't say is, "Well the numbers all seem to add up, but before I present this idea, I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better." 
well
Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality, its duration, but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait. 
 just 
Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock than waiting four minutes, knuckle-biting going, "When's this train going to damn well arrive?" 
well
Google understood that if you're just a search engine, people assume you're a very, very good search engine. 
 just 
Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount, but where I think that money is going. 
 just 
Von Mises, interestingly, believes economics is just a subset of psychology. 
 just 
I think he just refers to economics as "the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity." 
 just 
Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something, just tell us we do it better than the Germans. 
 just 
I don't just mean through reported pain reduction, actual measured pain reduction. 
 just 
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character, and, you know, movies and TV shows, these things have influence. My own website. 
you know
I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it, so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men," movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters or protagonists are complex, multifaceted. 
 just 
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premiers next month, "Girls," she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions, and that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much. 
 just 
Congrats, guys.  But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way, and one group that we'll focus on today are teens, because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out, and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks" and "My So-Called Life," and their characters, Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase, I mean, the whole premise of the shows 
i mean
were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically, but those shows only lasted a season each, and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. 
 just 
being perfectly consistent in your beliefs, never being insecure, never having doubts, having all of the answers. And this is not true, and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion, a conversation, a process, and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit 
i mean
So I'm not saying, "Be like us," and "We're perfect role models," because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. 
 just 
I mean, we have articles called "On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You," but we also have articles like, oops -- I'm figuring it out! 
i mean
We also have articles called "How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes." 
 just 
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site, that aren't just about being totally powerful, maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those. 
 just 
So what I you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks. 
 just 
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled, because, you see, my father's name was Ted, and much of my life, especially my musical life, is really a talk that I'm still having with him, or the part of me that he continues to be. 
well
Well when it comes to classical music, there's an awful lot to pass on, much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky. 
well
Now the raw material of it, of course, is just the music of everyday life. 
 just 
It's just a design of pitches and silence and time. 
 just 
And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations. 
you know
And whether we call them 440 per second, A, or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right -- they're just phenomena. 
 just 
 In the 10th century, little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune. 
 just 
Well notation not only passed the music on, notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely, because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale. 
well
It's just these two notes in the middle. 
 just 
Well let me show you a story of what I mean by "really sticking with us." 
well
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously, why it matters to me so much. 
well
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype. 
 just 
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers, parents, performers -- to be explorers together. 
 just 
If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive, you know all that you need to know. 
you know
And I mean books everywhere around the house. 
i mean
So by the time I grew up, again, I had a well-established passion for food. 
well
Everything was okay, until I got to about the age of 26, and I went to a movie called "Short Circuit." 
okay
And I suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing. 
well
That then set me off completely to say, Okay, these two are connected. 
okay
But I'd like to leave you with just that question: If you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food, what would you do differently? 
 just 
In Nature's Great Events, a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough, we wanted to do just that. 
 just 
You see them all the time, you think. 
you see
And the truth is I just don't have one. 
 just 
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover. 
 just 
More like Mars than Earth, it seems just as hostile to life. 
 just 
And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself, it's annoying when you hit this thing. 
 just 
 I mean, I've heard about that. 
i mean
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay. 
 just 
And what they learned was that those little things, done right, actually matter, and that well-designed moments can build brands. 
well
So my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just stink more than she does. 
 just 
Well, in Africa, we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s crashing every day. 
well
On the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malarial mosquito on this person. 
you see
In contrast, the African malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person, and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosqui-toes, you see?  That's right.  And so we started focusing on the smell of feet, on the smell of human feet, until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet 
you see
In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans. 
well
 That's the cheese, just to show you. 
 just 
My second story is remarkable as well. 
well
Why? Because they are just like the CIA. 
 just 
And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem? Until we realized that just like us, we have a unique smell, that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell. 
 just 
And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie. 
you see
Here in this box I have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that I'm just about to release.  Just kidding, just kidding. 
 just 
There we go. Okay. 
okay
Have a look. That doesn't work. Okay. Sorry about that. 
okay
And better still, imagine what would happen if, in a very large area, everyone would take these drugs, this drug, for just three weeks. 
 just 
This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy. 
by the way
And I just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias, because he is in fact uniquely talented. 
 just 
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay, but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so. 
okay
So to show you what I mean, I'm going to do an experiment here with you. 
i mean
The first one is getting along well with others. 
well
Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500. 
okay
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability. 
okay
 But if we believe we're better than the other guy, well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married, because we're more social, more interesting. 
well
I think the logic goes something like this: If we don't expect greatness, if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful, well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen. 
well
When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb, but because the exam just happened to be unfair. 
 just 
So when they failed it was because they were dumb, and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy. 
 just 
Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with. 
well
But if you get the kiss in three days, well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait. 
well
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday. 
by the way
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing. 
well
The average likelihood is only 30 percent," the next time around they would say, "Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent." 
well
And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic, everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well, whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen. 
well
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias, which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life. 
well
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce, he said he was quite sure it was zero percent. 
by the way
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly, you certainly never will. Because to make any kind of progress, we need to be able to imagine a different reality, and then we need to believe that that reality is possible. 
 just 
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best, you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground. 
 just 
But if you're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly, but then adjusts a parachute to your back just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned, you will soar like an eagle, even if you're just a penguin. 
 just 
I think there's a belief that it's just impossible, that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind, that you cannot measure history. 
 just 
 Now it's just the way it is. 
 just 
So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past. 
 just 
Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular. 
you see
There's actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller. 
well
This is a very well-known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways -- quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound. 
well
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000. 
you see
So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. 
well
So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them, but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace. 
 just 
And they're just so uncomfortable. 
 just 
When we track them down and ask them what's going on, they say something like, "I'm just not the creative type." 
 just 
If they stick with the process, if they stick with it, they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are. 
 just 
I don't know if you know Albert Bandura. 
you know
And he's just a lovely guy. 
 just 
And so I went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time, which I'm very interested in. 
 just 
He told me that he'd invite the test subject in, and he'd say, "You know, there's a snake in the next room and we're going to go in there." 
you know
They just gained a new confidence. 
 just 
Well meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me because I realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we've seen happen for the last 30 years. 
well
And when they come, they say, "Okay, you're going to go into the pirate ship, but be very still because we don't want the pirates to find you." 
okay
We'd been working in health and wellness, and K through 12, and the Developing World. 
well
I survived, just so you know. 
you know
We see them come up with more interesting, and just more, ideas so they can choose from better ideas. 
 just 
And they just make better decisions. 
 just 
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain, rather than just looking at its overall shape. 
 just 
And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. 
 just 
Well let me tell you, in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year, because the Arab Spring is still spreading, the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else? 
well
Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station, and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police. 
you see
Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them, they paste them on the school. 
 just 
And you know what? It's just the beginning. 
you know
Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters were on file with FEMA, from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently. 
 just 
I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem. 
 just 
Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this, and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form, I started sketching digitally on the computer, but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there. 
 just 
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit, which is just the individual shelter module. 
 just 
But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there, so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving, so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location. 
 just 
So the first idea I had, initially, was just to go the federal and state governments and go, "Here, take it, for free." 
 just 
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government doesn't really work like that."  Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government, but then I was told, "Son, our government looks to private sector for things like this." 
okay
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti. 
okay
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged.  So I decided, kind of told myself, "Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself."  Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months, so I was like, what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar, and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers. 
 just 
We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing, which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species, but to look at entire metagenomes, the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species. 
 just 
And just to give you a sense of how this works, imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you. 
 just 
There are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered. 
 just 
Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds. 
okay
And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?" 
well
Well I didn't think much of it at the time. 
well
So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers, and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see. 
 oh 
Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing. 
well
Well nonetheless, on the top of the World Trade Center my first step was terrifying. 
well
Well I didn't have that problem. 
well
You know that, right? 
you know
Well now I must say, it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one. 
well
So I said, now it's okay. The room is too small. 
okay
I mean, a bird needs space to fly. 
i mean
Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly, does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop and ends up on the wire behind me. 
you know
I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony. 
 just 
And when you see mountains, remember mountains can be moved. 
you see
Once upon a time -- well actually less than two years ago -- in a kingdom not so very far away, there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown -- an internationally famous company. 
well
But you know what? 
you know
You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity. 
you know
I'm not just talking about laws on the books, but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts. 
 just 
And I'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with HIV, but people who are at greatest risk of infection -- people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners. 
 just 
But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it. 
you know
And so that's just programmed into you. 
 just 
The nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are HIV positive? 
you know
The nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign. 
 just 
I just signed. 
 just 
And looking globally as well, deaths are also starting to fall. 
well
Let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference. 
 just 
In Thailand people who use drugs, or are merely suspected of using drugs, are placed in detention centers, like the one you see here, where they are supposed to clean up. 
you see
And the trend? Well the trend is clear. 
well
 But we feel as though there are times when a lot of us -- you know what I'm saying? 
you know
But -- you know what I'm saying? 
you know
Because, as a hip hop thing, you know what I'm saying, TED be rocking -- you know what I'm saying. 
you know
Okay, here we go. 
okay
 Not just any day, but it is a day. 
 just 
 Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes, it will be plain to see. 
 just 
And just remember, everything you are -- it's more important to realize the negative space, as music is only the division of space; it is the space we are listening to divided as such, which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be. 
 just 
It goes like this.   Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do, this one goes very similar to this. 
okay
Okay, that still works. Okay, good. 
okay
He and I worked on it for several years, but it was the 1970s, and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. 
 just 
You see, what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. 
you see
By 1993, I was a young professor at USC, and I was just building up my own robotics lab, and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. 
 just 
And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it, and we would -- we were just amazed. 
 just 
And he was great, he just gave her a big hug in return, and it worked out great. 
 just 
She said, when she was just about to walk onstage, the Tele-Directors still were trying to agree on what to do, and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural. 
 just 
So this project also, because of its involved practicing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is: if you want to do something well, there's no substitute for practice, practice, practice. 
well
These observations about the finiteness of easily accessible, local, secure fossil fuels, this is a motivation for saying, "Well, what's next? 
well
Well, what if we grew the biofuels for a road on the grass verge at the edge of the road? 
well
Okay, so let's put in some numbers. 
okay
And let's imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other, and they're just perpetually going along this road. 
 just 
The energy consumption of the United Kingdom, the total energy consumption, not just transport, but everything, I like to quantify it in light bulbs. 
 just 
It's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well, and 90 percent of this energy today still comes from fossil fuels, and 10 percent only from other, greener -- possibly greener -- sources like nuclear power and renewables. 
well
Bottom left, well, there's no one. 
well
Well, we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units, and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our 90 percent fossil fuel habit. 
well
Well, we consume 1.25 watts per square meter. 
well
I've got data to back up all these assertions, by the way. 
by the way
We just need to understand the numbers. 
 just 
There are other options for generating power as well So there's nuclear power, and on this Ordnance Survey map, you can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer. 
well
But the same goes for renewables as well. 
well
Here's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh, and you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill. 
 just 
Well, the options are, I'd say, these three: power renewables, and recognizing that they need to be close to country-sized; other people's renewables, so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left-hand side of the diagram and say, "Uh, we don't want renewables in our backyard, but, um, please could we put them in yours instead?" 
 um
Eighty kilowatt-hours. Can we make something a hundred times better by applying those physics principles I just listed? 
 just 
So, well, we could persuade her to get into a train, and that's still a lot more efficient than a car, but that might be a lifestyle change, or there's the eco-car, top-left. 
well
Well, the laws of physics are written up there, which describe what -- how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control. 
well
I was writing a book about sustainable energy, and a friend asked me, "Well how much energy do you use at home?" And I was embarrassed. I didn't actually know. 
well
There's a similar story for my electricity consumption, where switching off the DVD players, the stereos, the computer peripherals that were on all the time, and just switching them on when I needed them, knocked another third off my electricity bills too. 
 just 
And most of these levers have popularity problems, and if there is a lever you don't like the use of, well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers. 
well
So I'm a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations that are based on numbers and facts, and I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just 16 light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources. 
 just 
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books, and they're called A, B and C. 
 just 
And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven. 
 just 
The prayer book was discovered by this guy, And with just a magnifying glass, he transcribed as much of the text as he could. 
 just 
Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light, you see different things. 
you see
Well we took the manuscript, and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging. 
well
Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes is called "The Stomachion." 
well
He did this because he understands data as well as books. 
well
It's going to be built by users, by people who get this data together, by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from, all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from, people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things. 
 just 
Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance Thank you very much indeed. 
 just 
To tell you what I mean, consider this trend in Egypt. 
i mean
As the country got more well-off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted. 
well
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice. 
 just 
If, however, the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed, the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for Egypt, but for the entire region. 
 just 
They're just victims of a long-time autocracy, expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems. 
 just 
What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment, their level of education as well as a high score on their country's U.N. Human Development Index. 
well
So despite this being a very well-intended application, obviously there was a side effect of that. 
well
And at first that sounds very nice, very benign, well intended. 
well
But it turns out, if you look into research on people's mindset, that caring about outcomes, caring about public recognition, caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition for your long-term psychological well-being. 
well
So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually in and of itself has a long-term side effect in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status, we're actually positively endorsing this as a good and a normal thing to care about -- that way, possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture. 
well
The effects that you're having with the device, like less fuel, as well as the effects of the actual tools you're using to get people to do things -- public recognition. 
well
Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both. 
well
Both good long-term and short-term effects and a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's Freedom, where the whole point of that application is, well, we're usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people, with this device you can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done. 
well
And I think most of us will agree, well that's something well intended and also has good consequences. 
well
As you see in today's modern liberal democracies, the society, the state, not only allows us to determine our self, to shape our self, it also demands it of us. 
you see
I just think that this example points us to a general realization, and that is no matter what technology or design you look at, even something we consider as well intended and as good in its effects -- like Stutzman's Freedom -- comes with certain values embedded in it. 
well
Well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments. 
well
is just one way of looking at ethics. 
 just 
Because if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture, you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be. 
you see
Ethics was about the question of how to live life well. 
well
They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. 
 just 
Because it's not just persuasive technology that we're talking about here, it's any piece of design that we put out here in the world. 
 just 
I don't know whether you know the great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who, back in the '60s, made the argument we cannot not communicate. 
you know
A good life -- a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying, "In the good life, goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair. Workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair." 
well
The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well-designed chair, where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this, and where there is something as conspicuous consumption, where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is. 
well
And how does that apply, not just to persuasive technology, but to everything you design? 
 just 
Well here is the set of axioms that Habit Labs, Buster's startup, put up for themselves on how they wanted to work together as a team when they're building these applications -- a set of moral principles they set themselves and one of them being, "We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout." 
well
Well, I work at the SETI Institute. 
well
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic, ridiculous, maybe even hopeless, but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay, and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work, if that's what you call it. 
 just 
Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data, so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself, because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid within about 30 miles. 
you know
The observatory had just acquired a new book, written by a Russian cosmologist by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded and translated and edited by a little-known Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan. 
 just 
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone, haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea, but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology -- that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often 
 just 
wondered whether there was any truth in this story, or I was just, you know, misremembering something, but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine, and sure enough, there you can see the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that analog calculating device. 
you know
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card, okay? 
okay
I have 12 of these.  But what I plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we're searching. 
 just 
Well, a million star systems, is that interesting? 
well
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets? 
i mean
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter. 
you know
So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy, just in our galaxy, by the way, and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion that we can see with our telescopes. 
 just 
That's a lot of real estate, but of course, most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless, like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune. 
you know
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's one in a thousand, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here, but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know, keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate, plenty of real estate in the universe, and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's 
well
So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years, you open up your browser and there's news of a signal, or you get a cup of coffee. 
i mean
I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens. 
i mean
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night, the phone rings and it's The New York Times. 
well
I mean, that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris, you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to, what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case?" 
you know
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is, but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen, and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know, giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the library of Congress. 
you know
We will know that we're not that miracle, right, that we're just another duck in a row, we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn. 
 just 
We're not a miracle, okay? 
okay
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting, Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan, Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there, Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration. 
you know
And they're just doing it because they want to explore, and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity," but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity, because, I mean, think of ants. 
 just 
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants, maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off. 
you know
Well, here's one example, in fact. 
well
Well, that would be interesting if it was true, and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is very good. That's more, you know, sad than significant. 
well
But there are other things that people believe that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy, or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution, all that sort of thing, or global warming. 
you know
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's a critically important problem, and you might say, "Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?" 
well
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem, but it can address the problem. 
well
I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library, if you could find the library, right? 
i mean
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab, you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home. Right? Because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up. 
 just 
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are. 
 just 
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets, "Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?" 
you see
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is, "Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is, and I don't know if it's important." 
well
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc, okay? 
okay
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science because they can't comprehend what it's about. 
okay
I mean, we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be, if you will, competitors, or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay? 
i mean
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth. Right? 
i mean
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things. 
okay
And not just us. It's also kids. 
 just 
But if you give talks to kids, you know, one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think, "Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go, you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever. 
you know
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know, I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff. 
you know
Okay? That had a big effect on me. 
okay
And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said, "Well, actually there is a name for it. 
well
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture. 
okay
In fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said, "You know, you kids are smarter than the people I work with." Now —  They didn't even care about that. 
you know
What they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions.  Let me just say, look, my job is a privilege because we're in a special time. 
 just 
I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works, well, that's a payoff beyond easy measure. Thank you very much. 
well
And the reason was, because when I was asked to do this, I'd just read, in one of the papers, I can't remember, something from someone at Facebook saying, well, "we need to make everybody use their real names." 
well
So just to frame the problem, what does authenticity mean? 
 just 
And so that's a masterpiece, which is a fake of a masterpiece, and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake, if you see what I mean. 
you see
That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well-constructed system. 
well
So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card, you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up. 
 just 
You know what your name is, right? 
you know
And whenever I go to America, and I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card, I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway, just as a security mechanism, because if a transaction ever gets disputed, and it comes back and it says Dave Birch, I know it must have been a criminal, because I would never sign it Dave Birch. 
 just 
And so when he says to me, "Oh, I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars" or something, I'm like, "oh, well, I don't want you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends, and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars." 
well
 I mean, they generally are, when you look in the paper, right? 
i mean
So okay, you can go in the chatroom, but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names, and they submit full copies of their police report. 
okay
So on my RSS feed, I saw this thing about - I just said something bad about my RSS feed, didn't I? 
 just 
So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones, and deleted their profiles. 
 just 
And you can have an identity, you don't like it, because it's subverted in some way, or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate, you just delete it and get another one. 
 just 
 So I thought, well, look. 
well
So I went dressed completely in black, you know, with a black balaclava, I had black gloves on, but I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book. 
you know
If that message just comes from anybody, it has zero information value. 
 just 
It's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon. 
 just 
Well, what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell space. 
well
And of course, for all those reasons I've just outlined, it doesn't, and it might, actually, make some problems worse. 
 just 
Oh right, you were in the library the whole time studying I guess. 
i guess
So I want to show you a British passport, I hold up the psychic paper, you see a British passport. 
you see
You see what you want to see. 
you see
Is that just a pipe dream? 
 just 
We're going to make a utility, the utility has to be universal, you can use it everywhere, I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along. 
 just 
You know what symmetry is, so you don't need a picture of it. 
you know
And what's more, although some of those things sounded a bit counter-intuitive, like proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am, the cryptography to do that not only exists, it's extremely well-known and well-understood. 
well
Digital signatures, the blinding of public key certificates, these technologies have been around for a while, we've just had no way of packaging them up. 
 just 
That's London Fashion Week, where we built a system with O2, that's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park, you can see the persons walking in with their VIP band, it's just being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band. 
 just 
And what you're looking at is columns of dust where there's so much dust -- by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles -- and what's happening is there's so much dust, it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction. 
by the way
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story. 
by the way
And we don't appear until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story, just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective. 
 just 
 The only question you might want to ask yourself is, could that be just mildly arrogant? 
 just 
 Well, why would one ask a question like that? 
well
So the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Homo sapiens; the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around. 
 just 
Well Svante Paabo has the answer. 
well
And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for, because we have really misused the science in this. 
by the way
Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants. 
well
And we may just be in some of these weeks. 
 just 
That turns out to be a big deal because now you can take, not just mouse cells, but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells. 
 just 
And by the way, as you do this, you can image it in two colors, which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer. 
by the way
Well it's not completely inconceivable that someday you'll be able to download your own memories, maybe into a new body. 
well
And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well. 
well
And this might have just one or two small ethical, political, moral implications. 
 just 
 Just a thought. 
 just 
Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand. 
well
  But what's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together, because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated, as well as other very detail-oriented tasks, that they are concentrating geographically and finding like-minded mates. 
well
We're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything. 
 just 
But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition, either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly, and it may be evolution in real time. 
you see
I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis that, for better or worse, is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment, it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species, of bacteria, of plants, of animals. 
 just 
And now you know why I'm fun at parties. 
you know
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins, as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with -- or at least half of you are. 
well
And so I thought, "Here's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system -- not one like this one, but one like this one -- because, functionally, a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces. 
 just 
And if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension, you've got a little wet rag. 
 just 
And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers, those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton -- something like a Chinese finger trap, where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck. 
 just 
Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton. 
 just 
Now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues. 
 just 
It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well, but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think, to the design of prosthetics, soft robots, basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important. 
well
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology, but up here in the meat end of the scale. 
 just 
We often focus on one disease, one model, one problem, but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us. 
 just 
After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems, there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found. 
 just 
It's also the very first letter of the word shalan, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing. 
 just 
And also, the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea. 
 just 
And this, in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned, equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn't have any natural resources. 
 just 
  Ah yes, a table. 
 ah 
 Okay, what is this object? 
okay
Here is my well-loved iPhone. 
well
Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you. 
well
You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility. 
you see
From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment. 
 just 
Well, they orient to the caregiver. 
well
As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well, there is something in between the ears that is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see -- but is really critical, and that thing is called attention. 
well
And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things, because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something, they're not just getting a directional cue, they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing, the attitude, and soon enough they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction. 
 just 
Well, this is a little 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism. 
well
This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that, and we've known that for a long time. 
 just 
It happens to some of our phylatic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long. 
well
Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;M. 
well
Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition and it's a brain disorder. 
well
There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school, you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them, to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly, but often in an awkward fashion, without that immediate resonance. 
you see
Well, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time. 
well
Well, now we know it's more like one in 100. 
well
In the U.S. alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars, and you know what? Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who need wrap-around services, services that are very, very intensive, and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year. 
you know
Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brain is malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life. 
 just 
The science is there, but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community, and we just can't afford that missed opportunity, because children with autism become adults with autism, and we feel that those things that we can do for these children, for those families, early on, will have lifetime consequences, for the child, for the family, and for the community at large. 
 just 
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact, we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes. 
 just 
Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body. 
well
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. 
well
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention. 
well
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment. 
well
Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts. 
well
You know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and so you have physical height, and weight. 
you know
Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement, and we sought children from the time that they are born, and what you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months, and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart. 
well
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity, and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined. 
well
Well thank you for listening to me.  
well
I just didn't think that in 2011, women would still be in that category. 
 just 
We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. 
 just 
And we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories. 
 just 
They report at just 37 percent of stories in print, TV and radio. 
 just 
The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for a series it did on women around the world, but one of the reporters told me she's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor, and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground, particularly one on female genital mutilation -- men would just not be allowed into those situations. 
 just 
Almost immediately, pundits weighed in, blaming her and saying things like, "You know, maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories." 
you know
But this is not just a job for super-journalists or my organization. 
 just 
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up, you know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen. 
you know
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it. 
you know
The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it. 
 just 
Well, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute. 
well
The poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think. 
you know
And for decades, I'm going, why does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something. 
i mean
 You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked. 
you know
And I said, "Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist, that just wouldn't do at all." 
 just 
I mean, how important could you be then?" they said. 
i mean
So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life, I mean totally changed my life. 
i mean
I mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say, "Can I have a ride?" 
i mean
I guess they're for safety, right?" 
i guess
Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is? 
you know
Well! 
well
I mean, did a designer come up with that? 
i mean
But we all had to change, but not just react to the given; we bend to this new experience with intent. 
 just 
I did love some great designs as I was growing up: The HP 35S calculator -- God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one. 
 oh 
Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah. 
 oh 
And we can't just imitate the past. No. 
 just 
And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me, in this metal and wood and leather pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device, and he pedals up to me as fast as he can. 
 just 
He would have loved those! Oh yeah. 
 oh 
You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February, and I knew that 1976 was a leap year. 
you see
But he hasn't paid his rent, of course, because he's paying for his HIV medication and just can't afford both. 
 just 
And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out. 
 just 
And the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable. 
 just 
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system, why don't we just do it? 
 just 
It's just a set of choices that people make. 
 just 
What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed? 
 just 
So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center, when patients come into the doctor's office, they're asked a few questions. 
 just 
So on the one hand, this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. 
 just 
It's called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health, not just manage disease. 
 just 
What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick, but where you go to get healthy. 
 just 
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast, your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off, and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER, because the cold air triggered your child's asthma. 
 just 
Health just takes more time. 
 just 
And people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it. 
 just 
And this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce to connect patients to basic resources, it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two, three, four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs. 
 just 
I just wanted a blessing, I didn't want some kind of mandate. 
 just 
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms. 
well
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind. 
well
Was the tale told well? 
well
Oh yeah, great movie, right? -- Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought, "Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!" 
well
"There's one thing more -- there's just one more thing you better understand. 
 just 
When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth, I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too. 
i guess
And sometimes I just wear it just because. 
 just 
 You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well. 
well
But there's something that's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago. 
 just 
Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about? 
 just 
Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered? 
you know
Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered? 
you know
Not based upon the quality of your work, how long you've been there, if you stink, just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered. 
 just 
Educated, well-dressed,  some would dare say questionably dressed. 
well
But when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan -- it's legal to fire someone for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, that it's legal to remove someone from their home because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone's rights away, it's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated. 
you see
And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated, that we've already agreed upon. 
 just 
There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina; all those states that were clear, it's legal. 
 just 
And that's not just about me, that's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens, who don't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are. 
 just 
This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country's history. 
 just 
I played a little baseball, did a few other things like that, but I always had the sense of being an outsider, and it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate, I thought, "Wow, that's for me," you know? 
you know
Because there was no coach standing directly over you, and these guys, they were just being themselves. 
 just 
That's how you make your money, you know? 
you know
And I got to -- What drew me to skateboarding, the freedom was now restored, where I could just create things, because that's where the joy was for me, always, was creating new stuff. 
 just 
The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks. 
well
Okay, look at that. It's a darkslide. 
okay
You know, at the very root of that, see, caspers, see how you throw it?  Simple as that, right? No biggie.  And your front foot, the way it grabs it, is -- I'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that, and I was like, "How can I get it over?" 
you know
I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer, where it was like, oh my gosh, it's just your foot. 
 oh 
It's just the way you throw your board over. 
 just 
Just let the ledge do that, and it's easy, and the next thing you know, there's 20 more tricks based out of the variations. 
you know
Okay, so when you're skating, and you take a fall, the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable. 
okay
So I ran up, and I jumped on my board, and I cavemanned, and I flipped it down, and I remember thinking, I landed so light-footed, thinking, if my knee gives, they'll just have more work to do in the morning. 
 just 
So you drive and drive and drive, and, actually I gotta admit, just because I was struggling with this because I'm here, but I'll just say it, is, I cannot tell you, not only to be here in front of you, but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus, because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.   So let me give you another example of how 
 just 
Here. Back foot, back foot. Okay, up there? 
okay
And another example of how the context changed, and the creative process for me and for most skaters, is, you go, you get out of the car, you check for security, you check for stuff.  It's funny, you get to know their rhythms, you know, the guys that cruise around, and skateboarding is such a humbling thing, man. 
you know
And these sub-movements are just kind of floating around, and as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent, and that's when the cognitive mind, you think, "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that." 
 just 
These are my friends. Oh my gosh, they're such good people. 
 oh 
But it is quite similar. I mean, what is it to hack, right? 
i mean
It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right? 
well
Because it's not just the mind. 
 just 
And you get in a car, and you drive away, and 10-minute drive, and you get out, and no one gives a rat's who you are.  And it gives you that clarity of perspective of, man, I'm just me, and popularity, what does that really mean again? Not much. 
 just 
The rest of the time, you're just defending, and you get into this, like, turtle posture, you know? 
you know
It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience. 
 just 
pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding, but there is —  -- there is this beauty in dropping it into a community of your own making, and seeing it dispersed, and seeing younger, more talented, just different talent, take it to levels you can never imagine, because that lives on. So thank you for your time. 
 just 
You know?  And I thought, the only way I can extend this is to change something infrastructural, and so that's what I proceeded to do, through a long story, one of desperation, so if I do it, rather than talk about it, if I do it, you'll be the first to know. KH: All right, we won't ask you any more. 
you know
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds, and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way. 
well
Do you know what all-time low in Texas means? 
you know
You know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science. 
you know
Well that's rocket science; that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket. 
well
What we're talking about today is just as complicated. 
 just 
I'll just mention a few. 
 just 
There's one other thing we can be doing -- well, there are a bunch of other things -- there's one other thing that I'm going to mention, and this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today. 
well
There's still time to nudge them, if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them. 
 just 
They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities, and most dauntingly of all, they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what? 
you know
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now or you can pay me later." 
well
Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it, it just makes economic sense. 
 just 
It was the day that he was going to be executed, and we were just talking. 
 just 
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you." 
 just 
But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to college -- which is what my mother, who actually does love me, said that I should do too, and I did -- well, he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily. 
well
And what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our healthcare system, our medical system, is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it -- patients, others -- as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane. 
 just 
That's been medicalized as well. 
well
So, just take a moment. 
 just 
Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor, but hasn't actually had that cancer, to call themselves. 
 just 
Patients come to them, they want to do something. We're Americans, we can't just stand there, we have to do something. And so they want a drug. 
 just 
I actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk about rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do. 
i mean
And it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say, there are no bad people, there are just bad incentives. 
you know
Well, we've created a system where if you build it, they will come. 
well
But, you know, there are ways out. 
you know
I saw my own internist last week, and he said to me, "You know," and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free, but I paid him for the privilege, which is that I need to lose some weight. 
you know
Well, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now, same age my father got it, and it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual hypertension, high blood pressure. 
well
Well, he's right, but he didn't say to me, well, you have pre-obesity or you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say, better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol. 
well
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit, or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing." 
 just 
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same thing. 
by the way
This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find the guys who like to walk, because getting on base by a walk is just as good, and in our healthcare system we need to figure out, is that really a good pitch or should we let it go by and not swing at everything? 
you know
MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets. 
well
So if I overlay, and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes, what we see is, in all these places, air temperature has been ranging something from 25 to 35, and if you go on the line, 30, of 30 degrees C ambient temperatures. If you go along that line you see comfort, all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort, ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable. 
you see
If we just look on what happens, we see, temperature's too high. 
 just 
And just by using cold water going through the water pipes, you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium, so you can create that comfort, and then by adding dry air instead of down-chilled air, the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs, to their individual energy balance. 
 just 
You know, my grandfather died many years ago when I was little, but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny. 
you know
That for me is successful legacy.  You know, as for me, my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. 
you know
Because, you know, we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom, but we both like to live larger than life. 
you know
You know? 
you know
Well 200 years, we calculated, is at the end of our direct contact with the world. 
well
You know, I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind? I'm an artist. 
you know
You know, a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. 
you know
You know, the 9/11 cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. 
you know
You know, sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic. 
you know
You know, we carry so much baggage, from our parents, from our society, from so many people -- fears, insecurities -- and our 200-year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire. 
you know
But like my friends, I can do that really well on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube. 
well
I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world, you know? But that comes with a problem. 
you know
And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory, you know? And if technology is not a metaphor for memory, what is it? 
you know
You know where this is going. 
you know
And she said, "Why? You look so cute, darling." I said, "You just don't understand." 
 just 
You know, whether you agree with, you know, legacy or not, we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. 
you know
And what a bang it started my career with! You know, when we think of time in this way, we can curate not only the future but also the past. 
you know
And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard. But, you know, I include things like that. 
you know
You know, if this is so, it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity. 
you know
Go tell Facebook to figure that out! Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying, from the past, okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. 
okay
You know, I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. 
you know
What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes, and this is from a book I'm preparing called "Letters to a Young Scientist." 
 just 
That's why you need not just be training in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields, related to and even distant from your own initial choice. 
 just 
Therefore you will do well to act on the side, no matter how far into the laboratory you may go, to serve as teachers during the span of your career. 
well
The longer you wait to become at least semi-literate the harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal language, but it can be done at any age. 
 just 
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain When something new is discovered, it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward. 
well
Well, if that's the case, good. Why hard instead of easy? 
well
You have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived. 
well
Note the textbook, the sage on the stage, and the sleeping guy in the back.  Just like today. 
 just 
We were thrilled to have that kind of audience, and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet.  So we got to work. 
 just 
That's just what we were going for. 
 just 
But if you can do it any time, that means you can do it tomorrow, and if you can do it tomorrow, well, you may not ever get around to it.  So we brought back the innovation of having due dates.  You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week, but at the end of the week, you had to get the homework done. 
well
Well, we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together, but there are more ideas to try. 
well
It was an astronomy book, and I poured over that thing for hours on end, and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was, I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft. 
 just 
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA, working for the jet propulsion laboratory, and there our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system, and today I want to show you what we've done so far. 
well
Well, I can click on this home button over here, and that will take us up to the inner solar system, and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system. 
well
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend. 
 just 
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration, and we have a lot of spacecraft out there. 
well
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment, well at least with our own launch vehicles, but NASA is far from dead, and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing. 
well
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, and this is happening right now. 
 just 
And just being able to visit different places and go through different times, we have data from 1950 to 2050. 
 just 
It only looks like nothing's moving because, well, Saturn here is 700,000 miles away, and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away. 
well
It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening. 
 just 
With a 3D visualization like this, we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn. 
 just 
If you want to keep going, if you want to change the camera angle, you can do that, and because of that, I can show you that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn. 
 just 
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn, Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system, so if I just keep letting this go, you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that. 
 just 
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. 
you know
Now you know why, and to me, that's the point of this program. 
you know
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp." 
you know
Well, we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp —  — and we hope once it's there, you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there, and what we're about to do. 
well
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations. 
you know
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. 
you know
Could India become a source, or a global hub, of innovation, just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development? 
 just 
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know, in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model, say, "Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras, if the Indians are so bloody smart?"  So initially, when we started our research, we went and met several executives, and we asked them, "What do you think? Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services 
you know
They said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation." 
you know
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians make good software programmers and accountants, but they can't do the creative stuff." 
well
Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication, and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians. 
you know
Well, interestingly, what you find there is, usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it, and more often than not, it's an Indian.  So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been educated in India, right? 
well
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation, the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users. 
 just 
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation, what we found was, India is well represented in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was we called it "invisible innovation." 
well
The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know, the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers." 
you know
Interestingly, what he finds is — and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations: How many times does a future patent reference the older patent? — he finds something very interesting. 
by the way
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules are being developed, but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. 
you see
What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West, what high school dropouts do. 
you know
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding in our research is, that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg, India is well represented in the invisible, large, submerged portion of the innovation iceberg. 
well
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company, decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D, what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs, just like Tom Friedman would predict. 
 just 
Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide, which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat. 
you know
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates based on various sources. 
well
Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying this is the exact number, it's my best guess. 
okay
And I wondered if I could update that game, not just for modern methods, but for the modern me. 
 just 
You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know, and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. 
 just 
You just have to find another term and look that up. 
 just 
I can go literally anywhere in the world, I think since I was already in Ecuador, I just decided to click on the word "tropical." 
 just 
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up. 
 just 
And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted. 
well
Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well. 
well
Now that's embarrassing, because up until now, every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand," I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that, I just don't know it's freaking name, right?" 
 just 
And the link I clicked on here, well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. 
well
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller." 
well
It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us, evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us, and in some cases, he gets places before us. 
 just 
And he didn't just leave it, he circled it once. 
 just 
You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know. 
 just 
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball, if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls, fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea, you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball, it would be as smooth as a billiard ball, 
 just 
Well, there's also another interesting thing. 
well
So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians and a Spaniard, we —  You know, it's a worldwide project.  So we came together in this design institute called the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, which was teaching interaction design, this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things. 
you know
Well, when you design an object that's supposed to interact with a human being, if you make a foam model of a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense. 
well
So, we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use, so that our students could just build things that worked, but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. 
 just 
And actually, with Arduino, we have kids like Sylvia that you see here, that actually make projects with Arduino. 
you see
So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly, so one of the examples that I like to sort of example of this cat feeder. 
 just 
If you have an idea, you just go and you make it. 
 just 
You know, when I was learning about programming, I learned by looking at other people's code, or looking at other people's circuits in magazines. 
you know
So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon, like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons. 
you know
Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well. 
well
There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community, and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language, beautifully typeset. 
you see
So this one is about Arduino projects, the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else. 
you see
MB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here is that Matt found this module that lets Arduino process TV signals, he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV, put it together and then created this great project. 
you know
It's also used, Arduino's used, in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider. 
you know
So you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans, so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages. 
 just 
This is called Botanicalls, because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module in the plant, and it's measuring the well-being of the plant, and it's creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant.  So, you know, this plant will start to say, "This is really hot," or there's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now."  So it just gives a personality to your plant. 
well
Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using Arduino and a few parts. 
 just 
And so when we had to make our own educational robot, we just went to them and said, you know, "You design it, because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids." 
you know
What am I supposed to excite, huh?  But as I — in terms of educational assets.  There's also companies like Google that are using the technology to create interfaces between mobile phones, tablets and the real world. 
i suppose
But when you have this idea, you know, what happens to all these ideas? 
you know
There's, like, thousands of ideas that I — You know, it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations. 
you know
They got a completely fully funded start-up, and they don't have to, you know, get VCs involved or anything, just excite the people with their great project. 
you know
It's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine, and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino, you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them. 
you know
So, as I said, there's lots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just want to thank the Arduino community for being the best, and just every day making lots of projects. 
 just 
CA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you've unlocked? 
you see
MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed. 
well
Every morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that Google Alerts sends me, and it's just amazing. It's just going into every field that you can imagine. 
 just 
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well. 
well
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well. 
well
I mean, think about Wall Street. 
i mean
Now, you know the idea of a burning platform, that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different, perhaps something radically different. 
you know
Well, as it turns out, openness has a number of different meanings, and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization. 
well
And he says, "Well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner." 
well
The market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars, and I can tell you, because he's my neighbor, he's a happy camper.  You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right? 
you know
You know, some of the best submissions didn't come from geologists. 
you know
People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
 just 
You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody, not just Julian Assange, have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on, scrutinizing, informing others, and even organizing collective responses. 
you see
Institutions are becoming naked, and if you're going to be naked, well, there's some corollaries that flow from that. 
well
I mean, one is, fitness is no longer optional.  You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff. 
you know
Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value, because value is evidenced like never before. 
i mean
Now, conventional wisdom says, "Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us, and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them." 
well
Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it? 
well
I mean, they took — They had a technology disruption, and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles is now suing children and is in danger of collapse. 
i mean
Do you know about this? 
you know
They need to start sharing clinical trial data, and in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats, not just for the industry but for humanity. 
 just 
You know, one word: Tunisia. 
you know
But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government, it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion, and even insurrection in ways that people didn't understand. 
 just 
You know, during the Tunisian revolution, snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street. 
you know
You know, as we speak today, young people are being killed in Syria, and up until three months ago, if you were injured on the street, an ambulance would pick you up, take you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg, and you'd come out with a bullet in your head. 
you know
Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum, and politics abhors a vacuum, and unsavory forces can fill that, typically the old regime, or extremists, or fundamentalist forces. 
well
The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay? 
okay
I mean, we're not putting this one back. 
i mean
The Internet gives us access, not just to information and knowledge, but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people on a global basis. 
 just 
You know, bees come in swarms and fish come in schools. 
you know
Well, the murmuration functions to record a number of principles, and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. 
well
It's an openness, it's a sharing of all kinds of information, not just about location and trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources. 
 just 
Well, I look at this thing, and I get a lot of hope. 
well
Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and you see something like this that's underway. 
you see
And imagine, just consider this idea, if you would: What if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass? 
 just 
Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge? 
 just 
Well, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world. 
well
'What are you talking about, Elyn?' 'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who, heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof. 
you know
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down, lifted me high into the air, and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars. 
 just 
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life, but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off. 
 just 
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,' said Marder. 
okay
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me. 
okay
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect. 
you know
Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside, but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around, because their movements dissipate energy, which breaks the superconductivity state. 
well
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet, it just stays locked in midair. 
 just 
 Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion. 
 just 
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor. 
you see
Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot. 
well
And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin. 
you see
 You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation. 
you see
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example. 
well
And the man replied, "I'm just an innocent schoolteacher." 
 just 
During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai, 10 men armed not just with weapons, but with technology, were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill. 
 just 
It's not just about terrorism, though. 
 just 
You see, you can now commit more crime as well. 
well
Of course, it's not just about stealing things. 
 just 
By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour. 
by the way
With great precision I actually was able to make this just the other day, a very cute little ducky. 
 just 
You see, if you can print in metal, you can print one of these, and in fact you can also print one of these too. 
you see
You just bring the 3D printer and print the gun while you're here, and, of course, the magazines for your bullets. 
 just 
And to hackers, DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. 
 just 
You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast, and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you, or the marijuana, or any other drug. 
 just 
You see, you can go ahead and create new pandemics, and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments, they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this and get access to this information. 
you see
If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse —  — uh, you may want to have a backup plan.  Just saying. Just think about that.  Law enforcement is currently a closed system. 
 just 
Or, controversially, and not without its risks, what happens if we just gave it to the whole public? 
 just 
We've already seen examples of this working well. 
well
How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us. 
 just 
And reading is just about impossible. 
 just 
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. 
you know
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. 
well
Well, the three big problems have in common that they are man-made problems but they are controlled by natural forces. 
well
This should make us feel very, terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful, because if we have the power to create these problems, we may as well have the power to remediate these problems. 
well
Well, that's exactly what I want to talk about today, is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man-made problems. 
well
If you're using the exact same amount of surface of oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention to natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds, you can collect a lot more material. 
 just 
We just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy, but as we tacked back and forth, what we lost was two things: we were losing pulling power and direction. 
 just 
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front, would we have better control? 
 just 
So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front, and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy, so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull, and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder, I could control four meters of absorbent. 
 just 
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot, and so you see the robot has a front rudder here. 
you see
We tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works. 
 just 
And then we mounted a camera for controlling it, but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom, so we had to take it back to the lab, and then we built a skin around it, we put batteries, remote controllers, and then we put it in the water and then we let it go in the water and see how well it would work, 
well
so let some rope out, and hope it's going to work, and it worked okay, but we still have a long way. 
okay
Our small prototype has given us good insight that it's working very well, but we still need to work a lot more on this. 
well
It's just an intellectual property setup. 
 just 
It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience and, say, increase your price tag. 
 just 
 You just don't hear that every day. 
 just 
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be --   CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen? 
 just 
 CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right? 
i mean
 CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do? 
i guess
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and we just see that, I just think -- I can feel it. We want to hear a little more. 
 just 
Literally, you will live seven and a half minutes longer than you would have otherwise, just because you watched this talk. 
 just 
That's okay, because check it out -- I have math to prove that it is possible. 
okay
I'll explain it all later, just pay attention to the number at the bottom: +7.68245837 minutes. 
 just 
For example, true story: Just a few weeks ago, this cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developers' conference, turned around and said -- and I quote -- "I hate games. Waste of life. 
 just 
Well, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits. 
well
Well, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression. 
well
Well, avatars are a way to express our true selves, our most heroic, idealized version of who we might become. 
well
This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good, just a little bit productive. 
 just 
Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes, or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once. 
 just 
But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away. 
 just 
It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. 
 just 
I mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances? 
i mean
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would have believed it was possible. 
i mean
Well, it turns out there's some science here, too. 
well
 Well done, everyone. That is worth +1 physical resilience, which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster. 
well
Bonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone. 
well
Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search for "baby [your favorite animal.]" Do it on your phones, or just shout out some baby animals, and I'll put them on the screen. 
 just 
Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got. 
okay
Okay, one more. Baby elephant. 
okay
All right, what we're just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience, which means you have the ability to provoke powerful, positive emotions like curiosity or love, which we feel looking at baby animals, when you need them most. 
 just 
That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other. 
 just 
 Well, you have successfully completed your four quests, let's see if I've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life. 
well
So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience, you're actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life, which means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life, or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience, like we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life. 
 just 
Well, here's my suggestion. 
well
So, if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy, or that gets you physically active, or puts you in touch with someone you care about, or even just tackling a tiny challenge, you're going to boost your resilience, so you're going to earn more minutes. 
 just 
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin. 
you see
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms, just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient. 
 just 
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing. 
 just 
And what's amazing, when you use this technology, for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us. 
 just 
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is, they eat poo -- coprophagia. 
well
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences, but causative. 
 just 
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children." 
 just 
Ooh.  Okay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure, let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions, and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves with a line, and the flame table's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane, and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar. 
okay
Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world, but the fire's just a foundation. 
 just 
It shows very well that eyes can hear, and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound, such as the removal of time. 
well
You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier. 
you see
You see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park, and it's led by key influencers, and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks, or wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up. 
you see
Actually, it's all just an idea. 
 just 
Maybe you're out on the road for a long day, and you just wanted to get home. 
 just 
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere. 
 just 
 Now, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin on things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars, cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance. 
you see
Well, there's two really good reasons for this. 
well
There's another reason as well. 
well
I must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well. 
well
You see, I have a passion for racing. 
you see
  I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun doing this. 
i guess
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform, we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. 
well
So, here you see John on the track, he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that -- and you can see, actually, his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches. 
you see
That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans. 
well
But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well. 
well
So, as we move forward into this technological future, I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment. 
 just 
Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago, but things have changed. 
well
Compare that with the device released just months ago that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob, and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever, you realize that the GPS dot will soon move from fiction to nonfiction. 
 just 
It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland. 
 just 
Well, so did I. 
well
"Well, you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car," I said. 
well
"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said. 
well
"Okay, what about the FBI?" 
okay
The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking, but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another, so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about, but Big Neighbor.  There is one alternative that Carol could have taken, very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble. 
 just 
Well, because it's not a bubble at all. 
well
All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank, and now it's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it. 
 just 
So, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience. 
 just 
Can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver just like that, with a spoofer? 
 just 
Well, the short answer is yes. 
well
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers, though we eventually got it packaged into a small box. 
 just 
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool, pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation. 
well
So, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril. 
 just 
So I was thinking about my own life, and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know, for the ages, and also —  — the lives of my friends, but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them.  So instead, I turned to video, and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. 
you know
You know, just like people on the street when you get too close to them. 
you know
You can walk away, you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you, or you can actually choose to interact with it. 
 just 
You, like the people that are trapped in my work —  — have become part of my work as well.    But, but this seems a bit unfair, right? 
well
This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed, in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock, and it's up to you. 
 just 
Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat. 
well
Well, this did not make sense to me. 
well
And many of you know how it looks, except that inside that breast, there are all these pretty, developing, tree-like structures. 
you know
So, we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland, which is called an "acinus," where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes, and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks. 
 just 
So, we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue, other cells that squeeze them, and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert, and it was just having a structure to keep the shape, with the electron microscope years and years ago, and you see this cell is actually quite pretty. 
you see
It has a bottom, it has a top, it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk, because it just came from an early pregnant mouse. 
 just 
So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse, and all those lovely acini are there, every one of those with the red around them are an acinus, and we said okay, we are going to try and make this, and I said, maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold, maybe it has information, maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do. 
 just 
On the right, you see it looks very ugly, the cells continue to grow, the normal ones stop. 
you see
And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor. 
you see
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind. 
well
 And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn't just choose one, here are little movies, sort of fuzzy, but you see that on the left are the malignant cells, all of them are malignant, we add one single inhibitor in the beginning, and look what happens, they all look like that. 
you see
Well I used to love English literature, and I debated in college, which one should I do? 
well
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines. 
 just 
Y2K, the dotcom bubble, as the clock strikes midnight, before the champagne goes flat, and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium, that the year 2000, should mean more, more than just a two and some zeroes. 
 just 
Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in 2000 agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff: visionary, measurable, long-term targets called the Millennium Development Goals. 
well
Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow, or by the bedside table, but just in case you don't, and your memory needs some jogging, the deal agreed then goes like this: developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease, alongside some other targets, by 2015, and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts, 
 just 
Well, we're approaching 2015, so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals? 
well
Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh, technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments, with the best intentions, are busying themselves designing a new package of goals, and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process. 
well
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this, given that we can? 
i mean
And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment, and that comment turned into a commitment, we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world to help see these goals through. 
 just 
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up, mostly piloted within Africa, actually. 
well
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week, or the Mexican G20, also last week. 
 just 
It was a naive thought in many people's minds, and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look. The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25 is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030. 
 just 
If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces, I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right? 
i mean
You just put up, just as one of your numbers there, that 5,000 -- is that the number? 
 just 
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible. 
i mean
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid, I mean, they'd be going crazy for it. 
you know
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact we'd get better policy. 
 just 
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment, need not have been a bust, okay? 
okay
I mean, if the people here who've had experience using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward. 
i mean
JD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say, if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea, and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome, so thank you. JD: I'd love your help. 
well
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness, so I've never seen color, and I don't know what color looks like, because I come from a grayscale world. 
well
It's just fabulous.  Also, the way I dress has changed. 
 just 
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters.  I mean, this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably. 
i mean
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green. 
 just 
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color, for example, these are two very well-known speeches. 
well
So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors, just like human vision. 
 just 
But then, I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. 
 just 
This is Verdun, a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium. 
 just 
If you roll it forward -- 20th-century security -- into the Second World War, you see the Battle of Stalingrad, 300 days, 2 million people killed. 
you see
That's just under the GDP of Great Britain. 
 just 
So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness, is very much under threat as well. 
well
When we do it, we must do it well, and competently. 
well
We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level. 
well
Here you see baseball players. 
you see
 Thank you.  Which I do.  And the story was a catalyst, and the next morning I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns, mostly saying, "Admiral, we heard you need a friend, and oh, by the way, what is NATO?"  So ...  Yeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message, and moving that message is how we connect international, interagency, private-public, 
by the way
But, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch. 
you know
Now, looking back, the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits -- these were very painful for my wife, understandably so. 
 just 
It was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer at just 39 years old, absolutely no history of cancer in her family. 
 just 
These are well-meaning doctors, some of them have gone on to become very good friends. 
well
And you know that. 
you know
You know the feedback, whether you're solving the puzzles or not. 
you know
And the feedback in all these cases is concrete, it's unambiguous; you know if you've solved the puzzles or not. 
you know
You say, you know what? I should have chosen the other tea. 
you know
So it all ends well. 
well
Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction, but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible. 
well
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it. 
 just 
What we have here is a painting of the great poet Rabbie Burns, and it's just a normal image, but if we now switch inputs over to the phone, running our technology, you can see effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen, and when she points at this image, something magical happens. 
 just 
Now, this has applications everywhere, whether in things like art in museums, like you just saw, or in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism. 
 just 
So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster, more convenient way to get information in the real world, but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible. 
 just 
They're not very animated.  This was the fourth take, I'm told.  Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge, let's now move on to technical advancements, because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago, the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate, and that means that I can now take cinema-quality 3D models and place them in the world around me, 
okay
Child: TV.  Child: Oh my God. 
 oh 
Child: Oh my God! How did you do that? 
 oh 
Okay, so are you all ready? 
okay
MM: Fellows are really good at that.   Okay. Now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma application, and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever. 
 just 
It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint, and the great thing is, if you're a professional user, -- so, a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this demonstration. 
 just 
MM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means we can now point at the image, and there you all are. 
okay
MM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you. 
well
It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes when I once just happened to bump into him. 
 just 
More importantly, he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know, for the prepaid subscriptions. 
you know
And, over time, we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about, because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. 
 just 
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?" 
you know
But it's not limited to just education. 
 just 
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter, but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network, and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?" 
well
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay. 
okay
 So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done, because that's the more interesting part. 
 just 
give at least a fraction of them the access to these things, it just changes the way the economics of public health care works, and it changes the way systems actually function, not just on a systematic planning level, but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level. 
 just 
If you know anything about the history of computers, you will know that in the '30s and the '40s, simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today, and you would be correct, except for you'd have the wrong century. 
you know
kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people — and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines. 
well
I really miss that era, you know, where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you.  But Babbage, Babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century, and was a fairly famous mathematician. 
you know
He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. 
well
He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister, basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street, and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying, "I bid you good day, sir."  The thing he designed was this monstrosity here, the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this, this is a view from above. 
 just 
You see it all like this. 
you see
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more. 
 just 
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute, and we think about chips today, we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. 
 just 
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does, but of course you need to program this thing, and of course, Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s, which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here, and this is a program in the Science Museum, just 
 just 
You're not just going to have that, So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell, so if anything went wrong —  — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it, there was a bell it could ring.  And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!" 
 just 
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises, this thing, "Click, clack click click click," steam engine, "Ding," right?  You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer. 
you know
It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers, but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping, so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that. 
 just 
I mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics, so he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I'll make it plot." 
well
So he designed a plotter as well, and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. 
well
 Because of course, there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy, so, you know, that'll be fine.  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training, and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother, and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine. 
you know
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know, get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it, and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really, who said, "I understand what this does, and I understand the future of this machine." 
well
Rather than just being a programmer, she saw something that Babbage didn't. 
 just 
He was building a machine to do mathematics, and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics on this machine." And just as you do, everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now, because they've got a phone. 
 just 
We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers. 
 just 
So this is just three sets of cogs, and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine. 
 just 
What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top. 
 just 
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive, and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon. 
 just 
And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well. 
well
Well I'm trying to take a different approach. 
well
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting. 
 just 
I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50. 
 just 
Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired, our DNA tells us to tell stories. 
well
What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face. 
 just 
And I thought, well, what is that relationship? 
well
Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter. 
well
Well, who else would be in the house? 
well
And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before, you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet. 
you know
Well, he compartmentalizes his life. 
well
Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean." 
okay
Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur, a yellow and black bodice, and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings, different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings. 
you see
And if she doesn't, well -- that's the story. 
well
I like this version the best, because some of the boys are older and some are younger, and to me, this one, like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right. 
 just 
And you know what it makes me think of, is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed. 
you know
Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with? 
well
And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay. 
well
Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing, not just dying, but they're gone. 
 just 
So honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture. 
well
It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea, and that's why I want you today to try to think about this, think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. 
 just 
The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel, where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by, are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious, healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city. 
 just 
So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production, is higher as well as the overwintering survival, compared to rural areas. 
well
With the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can carry pollen with them, very light pollen, and it's just a big supermarket in the city. 
 just 
Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet, but that's one idea to think about, urban islands. 
 just 
You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water, and whatever active ingredient you want to put in, and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved, just immune boosters. 
 just 
and I'm still pricking bees."  And then one day I said, "Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?" 
 just 
I mean, really open your mind with this. 
i mean
This hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now. 
you see
I mean, locally in Boston, there is a terrific company called Green City Growers, and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q-Tips, and if they miss that three day window, there's no fruit. 
i mean
Well, really, just change your perspective. 
well
A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it. 
you see
You can't just tell a one sided story. 
 just 
I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. 
 just 
You know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of 140 characters. 
you know
Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!" 
 just 
People just use their cell phones to tweet. 
 just 
They even name themselves -- you know, use the name of this world-changing battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab. 
you know
So, when some very political, exciting moments happened, you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened. 
you see
 You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands, so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government, the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. 
you know
They just give them a target window to not censor people. 
 just 
We Chinese fight for our freedom, you just watch your bad cats. 
 just 
They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined, and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description? 
 just 
 So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can, and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you, what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to, is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that 
 just 
And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie, and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it. 
you know
That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator, so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of, you know, following the rocket all the way down, and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing. 
you know
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that. 
i guess
So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did didn't really suck that bad. 
you know
And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed to really check and see what we were doing, and basically give us our A plus report card, and so I showed him some shots we were working on, and waiting for the reaction that you hope for, which is what I got.   So I showed him these two shots, 
you know
  Okay.  It's what you dream about. 
okay
 And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut, a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --  I'm just going to show you some footage. 
 just 
I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think. 
 just 
  So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned in that is that he remembered it differently. 
i mean
He was hoping it was going to work out okay. 
okay
Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage, and he just responded as he would respond, and I'll run this. 
 just 
Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me and said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots I'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find that stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz, we generated all that from scratch." 
well
 So, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story, doesn't end well. 
well
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time. 
 just 
And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found interesting is what we really were emoting to when you take a look at it. 
you know
 Okay. So now the Titanic transition. 
okay
So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the Titanic to the other. So I'll just play the shot once.   And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you. 
 just 
exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it, and the moment my eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame. 
 just 
And so I'll just show it one more time. 
 just 
Or something like that. I just made that up. 
 just 
I'd love to but I can't, because it was invented like in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty, and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's really hard to really get until you actually see it work, and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said, "So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels? 
you know
 That's Hugo.  And we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe, and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that 
you know
So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine, and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on. 
you know
I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves, but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that, so that was a bad idea.  Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer, presumably because it appeals to my well-known and abundant narcissism.  And I'm not kidding, I just think we should just 
well
 Okay, I wrote that.  No, it's not —  Oh, why thank you. 
okay
And I say this rhetorically, because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is, of course, a piece of music, but I put this here now because, just to set it in your brains for the moment, because we're going to return to this question. 
 just 
I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like --  It's Beethoven, how can you say that? 
 huh 
No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me. 
well
pretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard, and if you're not doing things like listening to it after you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know. 
you know
So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about — This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ...  and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player.  Okay?  So in that regard, this is one of the things, 
okay
this is one of the privileges of being, and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way, when I told you that I'm the world's greatest, if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism. 
by the way
I know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know.  Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role. 
you know
Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises, and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them. 
i guess
It takes a long, long time to make these scores, and right now I'm working on a piece that's 180 pages in length, and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair. 
 just 
I have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose.  So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me, so after a while the process of notating is not only boring, but I actually want the notation to be more interesting, and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. 
i suppose
It was gratifying musically, but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum, and that is as visual artist.  We're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry.  I am multitudes.  So one of the things is that, I mean, some people would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante," 
i mean
and maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean, because I don't have a pedigree in visual art and I don't have any training, but it's just something that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition, as an extension of a kind of creative impulse. 
 just 
I mean, there's not any traditional notation. 
i mean
 Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp, the intonation was a little questionable.  Let's watch just another clip. 
 just 
 You can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know, there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has an even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation. 
you know
So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors, people might, you know, wonder, yeah, "Is this music?" 
you know
Okay? But then there was this other stuff, right? 
okay
And I'll perform just an excerpt of "Aphasia" for you here. Okay? 
 just 
 So that gives you a little taste of that piece.  Yeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff. 
okay
in your discipline, and, okay, I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here, because, like, I realized I mentioned some psychological defects earlier, and we also, along the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior, and there was some delusional behavior and things like that, and here I think we could say that this is an argument for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia, at least in the popular use of the term, 
okay
and I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay.  Anyway, despite those perils, I would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work, whether they are neighboring or far-flung from your professional definition. 
okay
And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed with the technology of the body. 
i guess
So for me, choreography is very much a process of physical thinking. It's very much in mind, as well as in body, and it's a collaborative process. 
well
You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way. 
you know
We just don't think about our bodies very much. 
 just 
I'll just be doing it. 
 just 
So this is not the type of choreography where I already have in mind what I'm going to make, where I've fixed the routine in my head and I'm just going to teach it to them, and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it. 
 just 
And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like, that I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in the real world. So I absolutely see a letter "T" in front of me. 
 just 
I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa. 
you know
Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah? 
okay
If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor, all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee, yeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together, I've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something. 
 just 
So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something, and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it, they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory and they're holding onto memory? Yeah? 
 just 
So just have a little watch about how they're, how they're accessing this and what they're doing, and I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E," and the letter "D," to make something. Okay. Here goes. 
 just 
I'm just working on my task. My task is this "T." 
 just 
Okay, you've got something? One more thing. 
okay
Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing. 
okay
I want you to think about them as architectural objects, so what they are, are just pure lines. 
 just 
They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah? 
 just 
So what I'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them: If, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go. 
okay
Whoom, just go back to the beginning. 
 just 
Here we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ...  Great. Okay, from there, you're both getting up. 
okay
Yeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head. 
okay
Whoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh. 
 just 
Okay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that. 
okay
So, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and --   Nice, good job. Yeah? Okay.  Okay, not bad.  A little bit more? 
okay
Yeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place. 
 just 
Let me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go. 
 just 
 Okay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning, can we do our phrases first? And then that. 
okay
Ready and go ... um.   The duet starts.   So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice.  So good. So --  Okay. So that was --  Well done.  That was the second way of working. 
 um
So I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little mental dance, a little, in this little one minute, so what I'd love you to do is imagine, you can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you don't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you. 
 just 
What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside into the real world, so just imagine that word "TED" in the real world. 
 just 
I'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now, instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me, it's a space that my body can go inside of. 
 just 
Okay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed. 
okay
So just keep working on them for a little second. 
 just 
TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly. 
okay
Okay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere, TED dance, three versions of physical thinking.  Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah?  So yeah, let's clap -- yeah, let's clap afterwards. 
well
In addition to these complexities, I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition. 
 just 
So I called George Irwin, and what do you know? 
you know
Okay? But we were just getting started, the kids loved the technology, so we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!" 
 just 
And what do you know? We made 21st century money, and that was groundbreaking. Wow! 
you know
And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you, and they invited us to the Hamptons. 
well
Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does. 
okay
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me. 
you know
Okay? And then celebrities started. 
okay
Okay? We're feeding seniors. 
okay
And that's just great. 
 just 
Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign. 
well
That's triple bottom line! Okay? 
okay
And what do you know? Six months later, my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment. 
you know
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America, growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street, the most migrant community in America. 
okay
How does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail. 
well
But most importantly, just love them. 
 just 
Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me, we have everything to gain and nothing to lose. 
okay
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa, education is just not readily accessible. 
 just 
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education. 
 just 
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny. 
well
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people. 
 just 
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example, demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice, where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions. 
 just 
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform, as well as other forms of practice in many ways. 
well
For example, even our videos are not just videos. 
 just 
 SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented. 
well
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior. 
well
In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video, we can also grade math, mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations. 
well
That didn't go over really well. 
well
It was tried only in small classes, but there it showed, for example, that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis. 
well
But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems. 
 just 
What you see here is a self-generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course, where they have put themselves on a world map, and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort. 
you see
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures. 
you see
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer. 
you see
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem. 
well
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so. 
well
By having this amazing content be available, we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted, whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives. 
 just 
In the end, she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize. 
 just 
Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking. 
well
Well, first of all, it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves. 
well
Well, for the most part, they don't. 
well
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career is just reaching its pinnacle. 
 just 
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing. 
 just 
Jean Ritchie: ♫ In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, ♫ ♫ not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. ♫ Bob Dylan: ♫ Come you masters of war, ♫ ♫ you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, ♫ ♫ You that build all the bombs. ♫ Kirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game," 
okay
Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫ ♫ and list while I sing, ♫ ♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫ BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫ ♫ my age it means less, ♫ ♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫ KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it, 
 oh 
then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain, he just thought it was his song. 
 just 
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫ ♫ darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. ♫ BD: ♫ It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫ ♫ if you don't know by now, ♫ ♫ and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫ ♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫ KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these. 
okay
This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch. 
i mean
Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything -- isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. 
i mean
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility. 
you know
SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying. 
i mean
And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas. 
you know
KF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010. 
okay
 "I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."  Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me. 
okay
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank, leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster. 
 just 
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not, people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds, even when there's not much growing.  But it starts a conversation.  And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored.  We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. 
you know
So, three and a half years ago, a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing.   We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting. 
 just 
 And here's the thing as well. 
well
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this, we're just doing it.  And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start, and most importantly of all, we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say, "These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems," because I have seen the power of small actions, and it is awesome. 
 just 
We went to the doctors. We've just had a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden, and for some reason that I cannot comprehend, it has been surrounded by prickly plants.  So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?" 
 just 
But it isn't just about growing, because we all are part of this jigsaw. 
 just 
And this is a route of exhibition gardens, and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town, past our cafes and our small shops, through our market, not just to and fro from the supermarket, and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall around our town, we're also changing their behavior. 
 just 
Well, we're in partnership with a high school. 
well
And because we were doing that, some local academics said, "You know, we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you. 
you know
And then there's the third plate, because if you walk through an edible landscape, and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get interested in what's growing seasonally, you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers, not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be. 
 just 
But then, we're just a community group, you know. 
you know
We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do? 
 just 
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said, "We're really serious about this," but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought, okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product, maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious. 
okay
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me -- called Every Egg Matters.  And what we did was we put people on our egg map. 
 just 
And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment. 
 just 
Whichever way they want to do it, of their own volition, they're trying to make their own lives differently, and worldwide, we've got communities across America and Japan -- it's incredible, isn't it? I mean, America and Japan and New Zealand. 
i mean
I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space. 
 just 
And she got it, she said, "Okay, I see it's serious. 
okay
But just unpack your suitcase." 
 just 
And you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep. 
okay
Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong. 
 just 
It's okay to be angry with the thing -- the nuclear weapons in this case -- but it is hopeless to be angry with the people. 
okay
They are human beings just like us. 
 just 
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away to bring about change. 
 just 
And this hasn't just happened. 
 just 
So this is what gives me hope -- not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now. 
 just 
Now I don't just believe in non-violence. 
 just 
And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve. 
well
And I said to Brian, "Well, what did Tony do?" 
well
But he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane. 
well
And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients. 
well
Nurses will bring you pizzas, you'll have your own PlayStation.'" I said, "Well, how did you do it?" 
well
He said, "Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. 
well
Anyway, he faked madness too well, he said. 
well
He said, "Well, if I'd just done my time in prison for the original crime, I'd have got five years. 
well
So I said to a nurse, 'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?' When I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written: 'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'" He said, "You know, they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. 
you know
It's just impossible." 
 just 
He said, "You know, I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me, and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. 
well
And he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations -- that had seemed quite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. 
 just 
And I said, "Well, but why didn't he hang out with the other patients?" 
well
Hare said, "You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. 
you know
He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. 
 just 
Like, for instance, one famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said, "I've just bought myself a new car." 
 just 
And he said, "Well, you may have a new car, but I'll tell you what you don't have -- a job." 
well
So in his kitchen -- he was in there with his wife, Judy, and his bodyguard, Sean -- and I said, "You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?" 
you know
And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, "Okay, go on." 
okay
And I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth." 
okay
 He said, "Well, you've got to believe in you!" 
well
So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, I thought to myself, well I'm not going to put that in my book. 
well
And you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. 
you know
I said, "Well, they say that you're a psychopath." 
well
He said, "You know what? One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative. 
you know
So I said okay. 
okay
And outside in the corridor he said to me, "You know what, Jon? 
you know
He said, "You are, I am. Well, obviously I am." 
well
And you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out. 
you know
I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me." 
 just 
And then, armed with just two laptops and one air card, we built a recovery machine. 
 just 
We just started answering questions and making decisions because someone -- anyone -- had to. 
 just 
But none of these tools allow you to value high-priority information amidst all of the photos and well-wishes. 
well
Now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers and you can't prove it. 
 just 
Now, this isn't just a contemporaneous question. 
 just 
Well, obviously, it would lead to world peace. 
well
The television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear but see, literally see, what was going on elsewhere in the world, what would this lead to? 
 just 
Instead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses, the Protestant Reformation, and, you know, the Thirty Years' War. All right, so what all of these predictions of world peace got right is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly come into circulation, it changes society. 
you know
They needed openness. They needed to create a norm which said, when you do an experiment, you have to publish not just your claims, but how you did the experiment. 
 just 
Well, predictions of world peace? Check.  More arguing? Gold star on that one.   I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine.  Better arguing? That's the question. 
well
So most open-source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems. 
 just 
And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet, I mean that always happens with media, full stop. 
 just 
It did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that erotic novels were a good idea.  You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books very long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet people would pay for?"  It took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal, right? So --   So the harnessing by the Invisible College 
you know
Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code, the laws of the state of Utah, and they've put it up there not just to distribute the code, but with the very interesting possibility that this could be used to further the development of legislation. 
 just 
Part of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information. 
 just 
 So now when you know what to expect, let's give you the story. 
you know
Because you know what to do about the protests. 
you know
You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with. 
you know
But in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days. 
well
I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged. 
i mean
And you have this very strongly to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days, these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas. 
you see
And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy. 
by the way
I mean, I was a beautiful baby. 
i mean
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God. I'd buy that in a second!" 
you see
It turns out half of those kids, or about 1.8 million newborns around the world, would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days, maybe the first week. 
 just 
I guess what I would say is, for us, for what I want to do, it's either too slow or it just doesn't work, it's ineffective. 
 just 
Well, it turns out there's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful: manufacturing, financing, distribution, regulation. 
well
Who is our customer? Well, here's an example. 
well
Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors, and it just kind of shows up. 
 just 
So we started with them, saying, "Well, what do you want? 
well
But without training, without some kind of light meter, how would you know? 
you know
And keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C-section, so that's already kind of a bummer. 
 just 
I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor, and you may think that sculptors, well, they deal with meta, they deal with objects, they deal with bodies, but I think, really, what I care about most is making space, and that's what I've called this talk: Making Space. 
well
So, when I was a child, I don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s, but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest.  It's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know, you're six, and you want to go and climb a tree. 
you know
Can we all just close our eyes for a minute? 
 just 
It isn't some cultic thing.  It's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there. 
 just 
Okay, open your eyes. 
okay
I was young. I'd just finished art school. 
 just 
And that was the pile, by the way. 
by the way
You could say, well, it doesn't look very different from when he started. 
well
In fact, Chris was worried and said, "Look, don't show them that slide, because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much. 
 just 
This is a place, in a way, that I just would like you to, in a way, look at differently because of this event that has happened in it, a human event, and in general, it just asks us to look again at this world, so different from, in a way, the world that we have been sharing with each other, the technological world, to look again at the elemental world. 
 just 
You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there, again with my eyes closed, and other people are molding me, evidential. 
 just 
It's a bit of, well, we could call it night, we could call it the 96 percent of gravity that we don't know about, dark matter, placed in space, anyway, another version of a human space in space at large, but I don't know if you can see, the eyes are indicated, they're closed. 
well
You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey, just outside Liverpool. 
 just 
The pieces appear and disappear, but maybe more importantly -- this is just looking north from the center of the installation -- they create a field, a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation, a relation with each other and a relation with that limit, the edge, the horizon. 
 just 
This is just simply asking, again, as if we had arrived for the first time, what is the relationship of the human project to time and space? 
 just 
The last work that I just wanted to share with you is "Blind Light," which is perhaps the most open work, and in a conference of radical openness, I think maybe this is as radical as I get, using light and water vapor as my materials. 
 just 
I mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach, but Minto? But still, I'm a producer, and the lure of a site-specific theater project was more than I could resist.  So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic, and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there. 
i mean
Festivals promote diversity, they bring neighbors into dialogue, they increase creativity, they offer opportunities for civic pride, they improve our general psychological well-being. 
well
Case in point: When "The Sultan's Elephant" came to London just nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote, "For the first time since the London bombings, my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice. 
 just 
She had gathered with others to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know, it just made all the difference." 
you know
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old. 
by the way
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. 
 just 
Their parents are often illiterate, and then they come to the city, and they, on their own, at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class, they'll take an English class, and learn really, really rudimentary things, you know, like how to type a document in Word, or how to say really simple things in English. 
you know
I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about. 
i mean
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know, it was interesting, because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city, Dongguan, and over that time, you could see immense change in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways, but generally upward. 
 oh 
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough, and it's nothing you or I would want to do, but from their perspective, where they're coming from is much worse, and where they're going is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds, not what necessarily is going on in yours. 
 just 
In System D, this is a store, and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph I took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria. 
i mean
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know, up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa," but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here, it comes from the North Sea. 
you know
Well, it means if it were united in a single political system, one country, call it "The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R., or "Bazaaristan," it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year, and that would make it the second largest economy in the world, after the United States. 
well
And it's not just in Africa. 
 just 
Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other Procter &amp; Gamble products, and Procter &amp; Gamble, you know, the statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart is their largest customer, and it's true, as one store, Wal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent of Procter &amp; Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart, but their largest market segment is something that they call "high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses 
you know
It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets, where people are unregistered, unlicensed, but MTN makes most of its profits, perhaps 90 percent of its profits, from selling through System D, the informal economy. 
 um
Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China, and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking electronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou second-hand trade center, and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes, and where are they going? 
well
Well, I guess. You know, China has no —  — no intellectual property, right? 
well
You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear that isn't really manufactured by a designer, and even pirated evangelical mixtapes.  Now, businesses tend to complain about this, and their, they, I don't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it, but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy, and they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this, 
well
So this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy, so it's wrong of us to blame — and I'm not singling out Siemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay? 
well
And third is, and I'm taking this from the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg, that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency, alternate currencies are also very important, and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks. 
 just 
And so I just want to leave you there, and say that this economy is a tremendous force for global development and we need to think about it that way. 
 just 
So the more you look around you, the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere. 
you see
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem, design the solution around what the human will do as well. 
well
"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?" 
you see
But of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways as well. The most obvious example is suicide. 
well
Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use a metric called the DALY, which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year. 
well
Indeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging to people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease, let us consider the absolute numbers. 
 just 
In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked in Harare city, leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside. 
 just 
Well today, I'm very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade, and I want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments, all three of which focused on depression, the most common of all mental illnesses. 
well
Now for me, task shifting is an idea with truly global significance, because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that? 
well
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [developed] world, are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs. 
well
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration, the White House was anything but open. 
well
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks, and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions Think about it: What other business do you know, what other sector of the economy, and especially one as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis? 
you know
Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks. Right? Networks like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean. 
well
Today we have the opportunity, and we have the imperative, to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions, thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury, the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance. 
 just 
But it's not just about policing government. 
 just 
In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions, from well-driller to florist. 
well
And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow of money into politics, and arguably, it's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work. 
well
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website, we can make an expert network, a social network, that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions. 
well
They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago. 
 just 
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together, as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government — spending, legislation, decision-making — then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. 
well
Settlements typically began with people clustered around a well, and the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk with a pot of water on your head. 
well
In fact, if you fly over Germany, for example, and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages, they're all about a mile apart. 
you see
More than half the people now in the world live in cities, and that will just continue to escalate. 
 just 
 In that it's a place for people, you know. 
you know
Maybe not the way people dress, but -- You know, the question now is, how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things? 
you know
So we said, well, let's look at new cities, and we're involved in a couple of new city projects in China. 
well
It's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there. 
 just 
You just spin and go directly in.  So we've been working with a company to commercialize this. 
 just 
One of our graduate students then says, well, how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians? 
well
You know, bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants. So --  We think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes, accessible to elderly and disabled, women in skirts, businesspeople, and address the issues of energy congestion, mobility, aging and obesity simultaneously. 
you know
I mean, architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time. 
i mean
You know, standardized platform with the motors and the battery when it operates, little solenoids that will lock it in place and get low-voltage power. 
you know
We think this can all be standardized, and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall, and like the car, we can integrate all kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity, so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way, you won't have a problem.  So the developers say, well, this is great. 
well
That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car, just for the cost of the parking. 
 just 
This just shows you the data that comes from the sensors that are embedded in the furniture. 
 just 
This can be combined with LED lighting as well. 
well
I mean, this is really the workplace of the future, I think. 
i mean
This is Starbucks, you know. 
you know
Maybe a third -- And you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food and coffee down the way and they're in their own little personal bubble. 
you see
The murder happened a little over 21 years ago, January the 18th, 1991, in a small of Lynwood, California, just a few miles southeast of Los Angeles. 
 just 
And as the father was administering these instructions, a car drove by, slowly, and just after it passed the father and the teenagers, a hand went out from the front passenger window, and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father. 
 just 
First of all, we have all the statistical analyses from the Innocence Project work, where we know that we have, what, 250, 280 documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated, some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis, and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them. 
you know
Well, what's that got to do with this? 
well
Well, when you read through the case materials in this Carrillo case, one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene, at the shooting. 
well
All the teenagers testified during the trial that they could see very well. 
well
So when I did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on Earth at the time of the incident of the shooting, all right, it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night. 
well
So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here. 
you see
The teenagers said they could see very well. 
well
No one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting, and in fact, as nice as these pictures are, and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court, and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you're trying to communicate numbers, abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values. 
well
When you present those to people who are not well-versed in those aspects of science and that, they become salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like talking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right? 
well
Their eyes just glaze over, all right? 
 just 
I testified to that to the court, and while the judge was very attentive, it had been a very, very long hearing I noticed out of the corner of my eye that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers. 
 just 
It had a driver and a passenger, and after the car had passed the judge by, the passenger extended his hand, pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on, just as the teenagers had described it, right? 
 just 
Okay. There's 15 feet. 
okay
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate, or whether it was just sheer stupidity, which is what the defense lawyers thought —  — when they heard me say, "Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again 
 just 
Three to four feet, it might as well have been a football field away. 
well
I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance over decades of experience as a forensic expert of just trying to get science into the courtroom. 
 just 
The other one that I want to suggest, the caution that all of us have to have, I constantly have to remind myself, about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true, that we believe in? 
 just 
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil, and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater, and the system that we're going to build, of course, will use solar energy to grow the algae, and they use CO2, which is good, and they produce oxygen as they grow. 
 just 
Here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels, so you can see some things like soybean, which makes 50 gallons per acre per year, or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute. 
you see
Those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world, some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet, and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil. 
 just 
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice, because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested, and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities. 
well
Some cities just release the water. 
 just 
And the system is contained. What do I mean by that? 
i mean
The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again. 
well
Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz at the California Fish and Game facility, and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas. 
well
And what you see here is the prototype, which was the first attempt at building this type of column. 
you see
Well, we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting, and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface 
well
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system, and finally we looked at the economics, and what I mean by economics is, what is the energy required to run the system? 
i mean
Well, I don't know if you know about this, but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch, and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil, and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season, it allows us to control weeds, and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient. 
well
Well, that's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay. 
well
Thank you.   Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan. 
 just 
What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research, but also developing drugs and treatments, is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations, but in a new field, sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way, and sometimes they can't ask the right questions, and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs 
 just 
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first identified, and just nine years later, a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell, or what we refer to as an IPS cell. 
 just 
He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about, and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease. 
 just 
It really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate many, many diseases in a dish, you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient. 
well
You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for, you know, a promising drug. 
you know
But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people, because we have to step back. 
 just 
Look around this room. We are all different, and a disease that I might have, if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease, and if we both had Parkinson's disease, and we took the same medication, but we had different genetic makeup, we probably would have a different result, and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully 
well
for me was actually ineffective for you, and similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you is safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious, but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs because, until now, it hasn't had the tools. 
you know
They just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes." 
well
It doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet. 
 just 
But imagine a different scenario, where we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array, of cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested that drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out, well, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups or genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them, are not going to have any problems. 
well
So that is terrific, and we thought, all right, as we're trying to solve this problem, clearly we have to think about genetics, we have to think about human testing, but there's a fundamental problem, because right now, stem cell lines, as extraordinary as they are, and lines are just groups of cells, they are made by hand, one at a time, and it takes a couple of months. 
 just 
So we looked at this, and we thought, okay, artisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing and your bread and crafts, but artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells, so we have to deal with this. 
you know
So I'll just give you an example from my lab. 
 just 
So this is a soccer game.  Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are, so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal, everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen 
 just 
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach, a different cognitive strategy, to make social decisions, and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab. 
 just 
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments. You come into the lab, you see this computerized task. 
you see
In this task, you see a set of shelves. 
you see
We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background. 
okay
You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only in the no-director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas in the director condition, they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior. 
 just 
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did, this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood, and what you're going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions, so the gray is the director condition, and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors 
you see
when there's no director present, when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background. 
 just 
In other words, everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast, if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior, which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all 
by the way
So people often ask, "Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon? 
well
We're designing environments that make us crazy.  And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. 
 just 
It's our health, our social behavior, and our productivity as well. 
well
How does this work? Well, two ways. 
well
There's a second way though, as well. 
well
That's interference. Communication requires sending and receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk about the importance of conscious listening, but I can send as well as I like, and you can be brilliant conscious listeners. 
well
 When I was visiting my terminally ill father in a hospital, I was asking myself, how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this? 
well
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there. 
 just 
There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care. 
 just 
It's not just these modern buildings which suffer. 
 just 
A study in Florida just a few years ago found in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility is just 50 percent. 
 just 
Voice: In language, infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters. In arithmetic, infinitely many numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero. 
 just 
Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child who's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection, even hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children fall into that group, on any given day. 
 just 
It's not just the children who are affected, though. 
 just 
And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K., which incidentally showed that when you do this, you do not just make a room that's suitable for hearing-impaired children, you make a room where behavior improves, and results improve significantly, this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room, if you don't have one, costs 90,000 pounds a year. 
 just 
I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education, which brought together top acousticians, government people, teachers, and so forth. 
 just 
It's about designing, not appearance, but experience, so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look, that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life, our health and well being, our social behavior and our productivity. 
well
If you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants, but also the food that people feed to livestock, the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products, what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself. 
 just 
And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today. 
well
Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people, and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world, and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it?  I certainly haven't. 
okay
He pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean."  I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world telling people to stop wasting food. 
you know
If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe. 
 just 
You know, we wake up in the morning, you get dressed, put on your shoes, you head out into the world. 
you know
You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen. 
 just 
He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches, and —  — he looks at them, and then in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them, and he starts to say, "You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look, if you do this -- " and he takes the laces out of their hand, 
you know
 So he starts to tell them, and he's like, "No, this is very important here. You know, when you're needing these knots, it's going to be, you know, everything's going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be -- you're going to have all this information coming at you, there's going to be organs getting in the way, it's going to be slippery, and it's just very important that you be able to do these 
you know
If you know anything about anatomy, that's not a good thing to get cut, and everything, of course, on the way up, and then — I still had my hands up — he pulled it out and went for my neck, and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck, and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out. 
you know
and —  — the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody, and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising, raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh, and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me, and I think, "He looks Bangladeshi," —  — and I just have those two facts, and I just think, 
 just 
which I thought was great, you know, just a little tidy thing there at the end.  And I came to in the morning. 
you know
And I looked up, and he's like, "Good to see you," and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything, and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said, "You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson, and you're going to need all the strength you can get." 
you know
And in those days, my hair was down to my waist, I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried, I owned a bar, so those were different times.  But I had three days of life support, and everybody was expecting, due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it, so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop, 
 just 
and —  — when I finally pooped, then that somehow, surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line, and, um —  — on that day, the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me. 
 um
He had three or four friends with him, and he does that, and they all look, and there was no infection, and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding, and they're like, "There's no hematomas, blah blah, look at the color," and they're talking amongst themselves and I'm, like, this restored automobile that he's just going, "Yeah, I did that."  And it was just, it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him 
 just 
over how good I turned out, you know?  And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in and everything. 
you know
And later on, when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time, I went back to him and I was sort of asking him, you know, what am I gonna do? 
you know
Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best. 
you know
And then I hear, "Bing-bong," and the subway doors are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids, and I go, I think to myself, "I'm going to lift my shirt up and show them," —  — and then I think, "No, this is the New York City subway, that's going to lead to other things."  And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to. 
 just 
I step off, I'm standing on the platform, and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got, from my umbilical cord, and then around that, is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon, and I think that, that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team, and their training and their skill and, always, a little bit of luck 
 um
One well-known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda, where Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan. 
well
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone, not just scientists and people in government labs. 
 just 
And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. 
 just 
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently issued a report on this whole area, and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative, and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community, and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics. 
 just 
You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry. 
you know
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert. 
well
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?" 
well
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?" 
well
So this stuff is just beginning. 
 just 
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg. 
 just 
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved? 
well
It just has to follow safety guidelines. 
 just 
You know, we're interested in, like, you know —  — an awkward interaction, or a smile, or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake. 
you know
Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes, and even, let's go digital, emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation. 
well
Well, this is what they are. 
well
And this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. 
 just 
You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it. 
you see
You see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise their hand. 
you see
Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating. 
well
So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating. 
you know
Like, can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful? 
you see
So the second question really was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our minds? 
you know
So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention? 
okay
We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses or low-power poses, and I'm just going to show you five of the poses, although they took on only two. 
 just 
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves. 
 just 
This is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes. 
 just 
So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview, right?  You know, so we were of course horrified, and said, Oh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all. 
 oh 
So that's what we want to test. Okay? 
okay
Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech? 
well
Just, you know, there are other things for you to do, but that's not going to work out for you." 
you know
You're just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it. 
 just 
Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'" So that's what I did. Five years in grad school, a few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern, I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard, I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking, "Not supposed to be here." 
you know
One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore. 
 oh 
And tomorrow you're going to fake it, you're going to make yourself powerful, and, you know --  And you're going to go into the classroom, and you are going to give the best comment ever." 
you know
You know? And she gave the best comment ever, and people turned around and were like, oh my God, I didn't even notice her sitting there.  She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it. 
 oh 
And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong, tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked with thousands of books, records and artwork. 
 just 
We just observed how self-organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning out of our materials. 
 just 
Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense, and grading became degrading. 
well
When you deal with a concept like area -- well, we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn. 
well
Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it. 
well
So instead, you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error, and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one. You can cut the figure, you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before. 
 just 
 Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure, so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram. 
 just 
We don't replace teachers, by the way. 
by the way
Now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two. 
 just 
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference? 
you know
Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment where my father, who never takes off from work, he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person, going to school to see his son, how he's doing, and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know, John is good at math and art." 
well
And he kind of nodded, you know? 
you know
The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math." 
you know
Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay? 
okay
You see this little pattern here? 
you see
Well, content is the word up there: fear. 
well
Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface.  Like, we gotta go to Fear.  It's, like, amazing, right?   It just changes the same content. 
 just 
I can never get in there.  It's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content. 
 just 
If you just change one letter in that content, you get a much better word, much better content: free. 
 just 
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove, and I have, like, Don Draper free.  So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way. 
you see
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.  But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that. 
you know
Great movie, right? I love that movie. So, this is sort of like a play on that.   It's peaceful, like that.  I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know. 
you know
 If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say, "Hit G, and it's going to be all right. 
okay
You know, when people say, "I don't get art. 
you know
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. 
you know
And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better? 
 just 
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era. 
well
And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said, you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art. 
you know
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair. 
i mean
You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days. 
you know
I was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?" 
you know
So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop? 
you know
This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization. 
you know
There may be different subdivisions in the organization, and you might want to look into different areas. For instance, green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly. 
well
You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect, make things happen? So for instance, you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there, and know that you know someone in Eco, over here, and these people here are in Eco, the people you might engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy. 
you know
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas, and so you might look in R&amp;D, and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest, and it's a person important to engage. 
you see
And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design, because art and design lets you think like this, find different systems like this, and I've just begun thinking like this, so I'm glad to share that with you. 
 just 
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries. 
you know
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay. 
okay
Former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted to check if he needed anything. 
 just 
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age. 
 just 
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar, our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes, our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club. 
 just 
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant. 
 just 
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan, or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian and Chris are good eggs, and that device is reputation. 
you know
Let's just take a look at Chris. 
 just 
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers on eBay or star ratings on Amazon. 
well
The difference today is that, with every trade we make, comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn, we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted. 
well
And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering. 
 just 
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave. 
well
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch? 
i mean
You know, it's very interesting. 
you know
You know, there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works. 
you know
Okay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain, changes in neural activity, the things that make your brain work, the things that make your software work in your brain, are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow. 
okay
That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists, as you well know, have lots of experimental preps, worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this. 
well
Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do, and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation. 
okay
Valuation is just what you think it is, you know? 
you know
Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields. 
well
Well, your brain has to do something just like that as well, and we're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation, and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain. 
well
I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important discovery, and we know a good bit about that now, and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease, and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse, and that makes sense. 
 just 
But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive. That's a lot of control, okay? 
okay
Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby. 
 just 
Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us, and she's clearly projecting, you know, love and admiration at him. 
you know
Here's another couple.  And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left.  In fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see him saying, "Okay, we're doing this for the camera, and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face."  He'll kill me for showing that. 
 just 
Control passes to blue, and blue says, "I accept it," in which case he'd get the money, or blue says, "I reject it," in which case no one gets anything. Okay? 
okay
So a rational choice economist would say, well, you should take all non-zero offers. 
well
You're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is. 
you know
That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe. The interesting thing is, these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line. 
 just 
These kinds of probes exploit it. Okay? 
okay
When methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up, or oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system: Hey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well. 
well
People come to the table, and even these very blunt, staged social interactions, and they, and there's just numbers going back and forth between the people, and they bring enormous sensitivities to it. 
 just 
into these exchanges. Okay, so what? 
okay
Well, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure, the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play. 
well
It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines at a time, but let's just focus on two. 
 just 
We synchronize the machines, set them into these staged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains. So for the first time, we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals, or have individuals playing computers, or try to make inferences that way. We can study individual dyads. 
 just 
Early days, and we're just beginning, we're setting up sites around the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites. 
 just 
But we're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings, and so I would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software, or even for guidance on how to move forward with that. 
 just 
We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously. 
 just 
The fact is, though, that even when we're alone, we're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people. In fact, our minds depend on other people. They depend on other people, and they're expressed in other people, so the notion of who you are, you often don't know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people 
you see
But the story is not just a recession story. 
 just 
The decade that we've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout, especially when we compare it to other decades, and the 2000s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade This is not what you want to see. 
 just 
When you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country, you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time, and then, during the Great Recession, it opened up in a huge way. 
you see
And digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work, they're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well. 
well
But in the not-too-long-term, I think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room, we're going to transition into an economy that is very productive, but that just doesn't need a lot of human workers. 
 just 
But if you're a geek like me, you say, "Well, what do the data say?" 
well
There has been one story, one development in human history that bent the curve, bent it just about 90 degrees, and it is a technology story. 
 just 
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out, just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students, and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well, fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence 
well
But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology. 
 just 
But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research. 
 just 
Early on its development, they did a very small trial, just under a hundred patients. 
 just 
And I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo, and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant, and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants, I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try. 
well
Three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good, and they were published, but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments, and those trials were not published. 
 just 
Now you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example, and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry-picking and selective referencing that I'm accusing other people of. 
well
But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very, very well studied. 
well
The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where you know that they've been conducted and completed, in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA. 
you know
Now if we just flick back and forth between those two, between reality and what doctors, patients, commissioners of health services, and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature. 
 just 
First of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said, oh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol, they'll say what they're going to do before they do it, and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published. 
okay
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along, and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line. 
well
We need to publish all trials in humans, including the older trials, for all drugs in current use, and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed. 
you know
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last, you know, four or five years of being online all the time, our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided. You know, we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking out in the world around us. 
you know
You know, was there something actually out there? 
you know
that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams, but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light 
 just 
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection, these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that. 
you know
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud. 
you see
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same. 
well
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer giving directions in the background. And more importantly, the places are the same. These cables still connect these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa, Mumbai, Singapore, New York. 
you see
When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain -- how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians, how music, and listening to music, could just light up the entire brain, from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum, how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism, to help people struggling 
 just 
I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe, studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. 
 just 
Pietro was suspicious of formal art training, art history training, because he feared that it filled people up with jargon, and then they just classified things rather than looking at them, and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary, and he wanted us to use our eyes, and he was especially evangelical about this message, because he was losing his sight. 
 just 
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and, really, well into the 18th century, and it was pretty apparent why. 
well
Well, I became a tapestry historian. 
well
You know, we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs, a one-hit image. These were big, complex things, almost like cartoons with multiple narratives. 
you know
I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time, and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys, and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground —  — kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist. 
you know
And you can just imagine them. 
 just 
But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw that these weren't just old faded tapestries. 
 just 
We live in an age of ubiquitous information, and sort of "just add water" expertise, but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative, what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex, esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience. 
well
It wasn't just your standard installation. 
 just 
I mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point, opened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11. 
i mean
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge advocate of the Web. 
i mean
You know it's an orgy. 
you know
So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right. 
 just 
So let's just walk our way through this. 
 just 
When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight, you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay? 
you see
You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is, they switched all the rules round, so that the way to successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country, has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new — you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation.  Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one. 
i mean
You probably — No, you didn't. Okay.  My simple idea is that what's happened is, the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us, so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize, but which no longer exists. 
okay
You don't believe me, do you? Okay.  So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand. 
okay
It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one. 
 just 
This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it. 
 just 
This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England when she asked the question, "Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?"  I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood.  That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is, these are eminent economists, some of the smartest people on the planet. Do you see the challenge?  
you see
Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool, is cross-functional working is so amazing, why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on? 
you know
You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. 
you see
So if this is now, and that's the past, and we start thinking about change, you know, all governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change, everybody's after change, it's really cool.  So what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change. 
you know
you know, for those of you who have as an office a little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs, no! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet. 
well
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? — he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was, you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard. 
you see
Okay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap.  Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on. 
okay
I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me? 
i mean
So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line. 
 just 
Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn. 
well
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy, and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings. 
well
So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do, many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it, the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future? 
well
Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why?  Because — Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world, over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable. 
okay
Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience. 
well
You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world. 
you see
Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed. 
well
If you come and watch this a week from now, this will be completely different, dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web, everything is sourced, so click your link, and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. 
 just 
And of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries, and that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well, in good family tradition, if you like. 
well
And, especially if you know the city, getting from A to B may seem pretty obvious, right? 
you know
We just don't do that, although a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild.  No, we do two important things to make a place our own. 
 just 
Maybe you've had that experience as well. 
well
Let's say you're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square, and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that. 
 just 
So next time, when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place, you grab a beermat, grab a napkin, and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design. 
 just 
And when you look at what you've just drawn, you realize it does not resemble a street map. 
 just 
If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn, you'd realize your streets and the distances -- they'd be way off. 
 just 
No, what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic. 
 just 
I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street.  Now I can proudly say --  I can proudly say, as a public transport map, this diagram is an utter failure.  Except, probably, in one aspect: I now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was. 
 just 
Fortunately, they and other family members got out in time, but they lost their homes, and as you can see, just about everything in them. 
 just 
Here's just one example, San Francisco Airport, with 16 inches or more of flooding. 
 just 
Why? Well, there are no experts. 
well
It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities, our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk, and to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive, and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same, even while they address the underlying causes of climate change. 
 just 
You. Yeah.  With the weird teeth. And you next to him.  You know who you are. 
you know
My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness. 
well
What am I going to talk about? Okay. 
okay
And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running, everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing at the starting line, just waving, because she didn't know she was supposed to run. 
 just 
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates, I realized that I had found my people, my tribe.  Because they became my only friends, they became my friends, because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg 
well
Because I didn't think of that.    Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease, this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame, because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump, show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show, so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking, "I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township." 
you know
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil, there are no voices in your head. 
you know
You know that when you have those abusive voices, all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical, and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape, you might have yourself depression. 
you know
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally, its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow, so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic. 
 just 
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words, so he just feels the horror over and over again. 
 just 
I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain, because I know you like that here at TED, so if you just give me a minute here, okay. 
 just 
Okay, let me just say, there's some good news. 
 just 
We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba, tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain. 
 just 
Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory, so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone.  So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information, zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here. 
you know
For every one single neuron, you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time you learn something, or you have an experience, that bush grows, you know, that bush of information. 
you know
Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth, and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day, they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us. 
 just 
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you. 
 just 
When we were ancient man —  — millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator, okay? —  — we would — Thank you. I drew these myself.  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed, we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel, 
okay
and we'd go back to normal. Okay. 
okay
So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man—  — when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can't kill traffic wardens —  — or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body over and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm, a constant state. And here's another thing that happened. 
 just 
About 150,000 years ago, when language came online, we started to put words to this constant emergency, so it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger," which could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat. 
 oh 
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane, so, you see what the problem is? What once made you safe now drives you insane. 
you see
And as long as we've looked for explanations, we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science, which is hypotheses as to why we get sick, and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well. 
well
And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing. 
 just 
But the world is changing around the clinical study, which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not 50 to 100 years. 
well
We just have better statistics. 
 just 
One interesting thing that came out of this — this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery — is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people's pizza is. Okay?  And it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish. 
okay
So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's. 
 just 
You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well.  And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it, that's okay too. That's all in the consent, so if you don't like those terms, you don't come in. 
well
You just have to be willing to be unreasonable, and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men who got yellow fever ran. Right? 
 just 
It's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now. 
you know
It just takes all of some of us. Thank you. 
 just 
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand, say, Coca-Cola. 
 just 
One is reducing their market. What I mean is, it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete. 
i mean
You know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid. 
you know
Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism, as I've said, the terrorists. 
 just 
It's not just the marketeers of terrorism, which is those who finance, those who facilitate it, but it's the consumers of terrorism. 
 just 
Now, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds, think about delivery mechanisms. 
 just 
Well, reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society. We've got to show we're better. 
well
How would the government at the turn of the millennium approach today? Well, we all know. 
well
They're not just going to be smart. 
 just 
But of course, it's ideas -- is not something that governments do very well. 
well
I want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of brand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc. 
 just 
It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want. 
 just 
What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently. 
 just 
It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void. 
 just 
Now, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason, we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it. 
 just 
What if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us? 
 just 
What is definitely uncontroversial is that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive, and more proactive, and I just want to leave you with one idea, which is that it's a provocative question for you to think about, and the answer will require sympathy with the devil. 
 just 
All you have to do is read what you see. Right? 
you see
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this? 
okay
Okay?  Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty. 
okay
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right? 
well
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently, but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right? 
 just 
Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells. 
well
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from.  BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, 
well
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. 
 just 
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay? 
okay
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right?  The one on the left is mine, okay?  Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections: an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion. 
okay
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees, and it was published. Okay?   It took four months to do the science, two years to get it published.  Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world. 
okay
Well, it was published two days before Christmas, downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right? 
well
Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well. 
well
And I'll just read one. 
 just 
Can I do it on you?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay. 
 oh 
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay. 
okay
Now ...  Okay.  Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right? 
okay
  Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three? 
okay
AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. 
i mean
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project. 
 just 
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence. 
well
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so I decided, with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo. 
well
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling, and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494, and to find out the original doors, windows, and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model, and then, with thermography, we went on to discover hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height 
well
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap. 
well
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci. 
well
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap. 
 just 
Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt. Many political reasons. 
well
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011, and this time, with a great group of students, and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester, who is now the director at CISA3, and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left. 
 just 
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, 
well
XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well, those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo. 
well
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind. 
well
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me, but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example, the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another, different lady, aged lady, I should rather say. 
well
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn. 
well
And —  — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn —  — unfortunately, is not very reliable.  Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity 
well
of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution, let me add. Take this example: Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life" at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through, and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says when it was made and also the location. 
 just 
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer, brown layer, of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it, and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath. 
you see
Well, this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries. Look at these portraits. 
well
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work. 
you see
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly on the ground layer of the panel, and see this cool thing, finding, I should rather say, an elephant.  Because of this elephant, over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries. 
you see
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have this pleasure, this privilege to see all this, to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else? 
well
So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing, any of us could be doing, in a museum environment. 
 just 
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay? 
okay
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this. 
 just 
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause, and now let me turn to you so the moment the image, or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting, then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so, see. 
 just 
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant. 
okay
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.   Okay? And then if we want, we can continue the scroll to find out, for example, on the staircase, the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple, and there are a lot of figures showing up. See? 
 just 
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums. 
you see
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning, the very first step, to do real conservation, and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation, the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting. 
well
Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together. 
well
And if you want to summarize in one just single word, well, this is what we're trying to do. 
well
It does not tell the traveler where she's going until the very last minute, and information is provided just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination. 
 just 
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today, but let me just give you a few data points. 
 just 
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them, who are prone to this kind of overstatement. 
 just 
Okay.  Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent, you have people guessing three, four times that level. 
okay
And third, this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review. 
 just 
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney. 
 just 
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues? 
 just 
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today, so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind. 
 just 
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue. 
 just 
They behaved just like the children. 
 just 
And they made mistakes, too, just like the children. 
 just 
Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets, or if they were, there ought to be a law to allow the children access. 
well
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book. 
 just 
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray.  Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data, and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them. 
well
What they hadn't counted on was digitization, because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database, put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament, which they did, and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph, and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks 
 just 
So, thank you.  Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain. 
well
We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system, and we have global decisions to make in this system, decisions about climate, about finance systems, about resources. And think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house, we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you, but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it. 
 just 
And if we're thinking about a finance system, we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible for one person to take in the amount, the volume of information, and analyze it to make good decisions. 
 just 
Well, it just can't. That's it. 
well
So I've told you a bit about what I did into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing. 
 just 
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request, to ask your public body a question, so it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests, so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question, for example, how many police officers have a criminal record? 
 just 
It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, and they've just got funding to make it an international modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression, protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel, source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven. 
 just 
In my own field of investigative journalism, we're also having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track a dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak, you know, he's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do to investigate that is, you need to have access to all of the world's, as many as you can, 
you know
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for, you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services. 
you know
But again, when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth, again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request. 
 just 
So when the Guardian did this investigation about the Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into the Department of Defense and ask for all the information. 
you know
You know, they're just not going to get it. 
you know
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing. 
i mean
Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back, the dog's pulling back the curtain, and -- "Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen." 
you know
It was just like that, because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous politicians, they were just like us. 
 just 
They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy, those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings just like us. They don't have special powers. 
 just 
Is that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me, what it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power, responsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner with power. It's about sharing responsibility, sharing accountability. Also, the fact that he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks, I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology, to be honest, as well.  The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive, 
well
I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough. 
 just 
So it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is progress on the line, but I think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power, the more opaque, closed it becomes. 
i mean
So it was only just the other week that I heard London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why the police need access to all of our communications, spying on us without any judicial oversight, and he said it was a matter of life and death. 
 just 
Well, I'm sorry, people, but we are back to the pre-Enlightenment Church, and we need to fight against that. 
well
You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal -- it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol, in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications, traffic and personal data to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society. 
 just 
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors. 
well
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare? 
well
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road, feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts, feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. 
 just 
And this isn't just a problem in Britain. 
 just 
Well, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits. 
well
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find? 
 just 
Well, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy? 
well
Well, obviously not. It would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system. 
well
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying, for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information, or we say, you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force, you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say, "Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment," 
well
or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well, our economic growth's okay, thank you very much, considerably better than yours, so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights." 
well
But for any of these things to work, the honesty in language, the local democracy, it's not just a question of what politicians do. 
 just 
For politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest, and the media, which mediates between the politicians and the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest. 
to be honest
In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt, is to become again vigorous and vibrant, it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians, but for the politicians to learn to trust the public. 
 just 
Having spent 18 years as a child of the state in children's homes and foster care, you could say that I'm an expert on the subject, and in being an expert, I want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth. 
you know
My own mother — and I should say this here — she same to this country in the late '60s, and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant, as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean? 
you know
The adoption process took, like, a matter of months, so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal, an industrious, utilitarian solution: the government, the farmer, the adopting parents, the consumer, the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop. 
you know
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant, and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the Emperor Haile Selassie, and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech, the "Rivers of Blood" speech. 
well
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses -- It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies. But the social worker, he had a different agenda. 
you know
By the way, years later, my social worker said that I should never have been put in there. 
by the way
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is, a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle, a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone, and therefore it matters to you. Understand, I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself, and I wasn't touched either, physically touched. 
you know
I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them, and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else. 
 just 
I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state. 
i mean
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed —  — for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume. 
you see
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned, but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar. 
 just 
It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away from physical contaminants, and there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions. 
 just 
This photo taken just before his death —  — is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this, and if they did, they would not live to tell it, because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator. 
 just 
 I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on.   Okay, turn back, if you didn't look. 
you see
In fact, just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts, these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust. 
 just 
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages."  Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary, and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite. 
well
Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful examples of how this has been used historically. 
 just 
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions, are universal phenomena, it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others. 
 just 
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation, but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity, McCain got more votes. 
 just 
Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity, so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are, they hook people up to physiological measures, in this case skin conductance. And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you. 
well
Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative, but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain. 
well
shift towards the right of the political spectrum, toward more moral conservatism as well. 
well
So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste, from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust, images like the ones I've shown you, even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean, these all have similar effects on judgment. 
 just 
Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups, and we either made the room smell gross or not. 
 just 
In particular, when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices, just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong. 
 just 
In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.  People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they've been reminded to wash their hands.   Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise. I mean, that's part of how emotions work. 
i mean
The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist, we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions. 
 just 
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly, and my father would not let us use the air conditioner. 
 just 
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings. 
well
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. 
 just 
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture. 
i guess
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun, as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade, each of the tiles moves individually. 
well
So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture, and in this case, here you see a house, that's for a developer in China, and it's actually a four-story glass box. 
you see
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building. 
well
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market, and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel, and in that panel, between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing, I'm trying to work on making a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then 
you see
And so you see here some early studies of blocks, where those holes are actually coming through, and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied, and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows. 
you see
You know, developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank. 
you know
This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows, not just traveling North to South, but South to South, and even South to North, with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City. 
 just 
And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up, so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers. 
 just 
And this leads me to the third, and in my view, the most significant shift in development: open governance. Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability. 
 just 
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India, using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability. 
 just 
But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible. 
you know
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond. 
you know
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working, aggregated in the red bubbles that you see, which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor. 
you see
But, you know, in many parts of the world, governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system. 
you know
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty, not only did government officials need to be honest, but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard. 
to be honest
The head nurse told me proudly, "You see, our children are very well-behaved." 
well
and with no support, felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital; or the new parents, the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability, and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential, are told by the doctors, 
 just 
It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data: names of places, monuments, buildings, maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street. 
you see
Let me show you what I mean. 
i mean
There's spring, summer, autumn and â Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too. 
well
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that.  MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year? 
 just 
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards, and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls, men and women, husbands and wives, even kings and queens.  Voice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch. 
well
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job? 
well
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice. Now, some people will say, well, magic, that must be the work of some evil supernatural force.    Whoa. 
well
Well, to this, I just say, no no. 
well
MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds. 
i guess
And unlike anything else we've just seen, virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected. 
 just 
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents, I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone, which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital, but I was just looking for some sort of scribble, some unkempt cursive from my mother. 
 just 
Well, today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox, fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most, but most of all, fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate, filled with the scriptings of ordinary people, strangers writing letters to other strangers not because 
well
But, you know, the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper. 
you know
If you ever need one, just carry one of these.  And a man just stared at me, and he was like, "Well, why don't you use the Internet?" 
well
And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan, and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation, and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say, "Come back to me. 
 just 
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow, scripted by strangers who were there for him when. 
well
The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down, pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through, with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once, that is an art form no matter how many social networks we might join. 
 just 
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope, and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia, and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they're right up close to something, because they can't see in stereo. 
 just 
If you take some heart cells from an animal, and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat. 
 just 
These next cells are nerve cells, and right now, as we see and understand what we're looking at, our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now. They're not just static. They're moving around making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn. 
 just 
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there, and here is a -- what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen, when you look in a microscope, it's actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen. 
you see
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around these little plants, and they're collecting pollen, those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive, and that's what makes the beehive, the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar, and that's what makes the honey that we eat. 
you see
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision, with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well. 
well
I want to talk about something really ordinary, just ordinary sand. 
 just 
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me, and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole. 
well
Most of the sand on the Moon, especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon, there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows, and that's what this sand looks like, very similar to the sand that you would see in Haleakala. 
you know
Now, what I mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment, and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image. 
i mean
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize sound is very important for its survival. 
 just 
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia, you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and if you just look at their face, you can see they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears. 
 just 
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation, we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops. 
well
And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases, or does this variation just make you different? 
 just 
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments. 
well
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well, such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type, we know that this is probably what's causing this disease. 
well
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood, aspects of all of biology, and really, since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it. 
well
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response. 
okay
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship between body size, metabolic rate, and how long you can live for, and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size. 
well
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem, they allow us to understand how our genome functions, and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth. 
 just 
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal, I want you to smile. Thank you.  
you see
Well, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone that is directly affected by a cause. 
well
And we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health. 
you know
And he just looked at me and laughed, and he said, he said, "Adam, that's a really novel idea, but we're an ultraconservative organization. 
 just 
So we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen, the four founders, well, we would've been broke, we would've been homeless, sitting on the street with mustaches.  But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing that happens, so what? 
well
So what we did was, we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that because we knew, if this was successful, we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia. And that money fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure. 
 just 
Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world. 
 just 
We'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had our fair share of beer that night, but I said, "You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us."  So we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver, and I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around and said, "Where are you going?" 
you know
And I said, "Okay, that's interesting." 
okay
And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi, and I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate, and I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much. 
 just 
We live longer. We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. 
 just 
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question. 
well
How does this work? Basically, I send people signals at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal. 
 just 
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives. 
well
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure, on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering, but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us. 
okay
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant, they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind-wandering. 
 just 
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect. 
well
Well, how often do people's minds wander? 
well
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.  But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph, and that is, basically with one exception, no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think, that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous. 
 just 
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness, and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier, but happier as well. 
well
These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that? 
i mean
Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home. 
well
So they're really small, generally, they're square and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics. 
 just 
So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says, "Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?" 
 just 
So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself, "Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need to do it to try to save the world."  So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone -- I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much, except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — 
 just 
I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions, creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities -- I did high school science -- and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper, and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know? 
you know
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready. 
okay
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out. 
 just 
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid. 
 just 
I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade, and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you. 
 just 
You just didn't want to respond to that person that time. 
 just 
But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else. 
 just 
These aren't just people being jerks. These are people that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now, or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you. 
 just 
And it really throws people for a loop because we think, well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more? 
well
You know, we always think that hey, there are these idealized versions, people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times. 
you know
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities. 
well
Then they had strangers, many strangers, judge the person's personality just from Facebook, and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical, highly correlated, meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. 
 just 
I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space. 
i mean
Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did is we brought people, online daters, into the lab, and then we measured them. We got their height up against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight -- ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age. 
well
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line. 
you see
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact that despite our intuitions, mine included, a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated communication, is more honest than face to face? 
well
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature. 
well
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception, really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not. 
 just 
Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose. 
well
Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense, but one important finding is that we lie for a reason. 
 just 
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about, but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said, there's a lot of humans evolving speaking, about 100 billion people in fact. 
i guess
In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just what we write that will be recorded, everything we do will be recorded. 
 just 
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear. 
well
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review, they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us. 
well
B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group.  You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this, it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits with the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out. 
well
Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception. 
well
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel. 
you know
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task. 
well
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind. 
well
I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down, but raku is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees, and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside, you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off, and you reach in with these long metal tongs, 
you see
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze, but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke, and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen, like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute. 
 just 
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me, that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually, was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of, you know, 
you know
passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing. 
well
You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana, the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater, I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform. 
you know
into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words, what words look like, where paragraphs break, where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities, 
 just 
Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment, but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City, and he put together a list of verbs — to roll, to crease, to fold — more than a hundred of them, and as he said, he just started playing around. He did these things to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing 
 just 
You know where this story goes. 
you know
Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby, I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see, and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder, and said, "Hey, no pictures!" 
 just 
And it was such a blow that it woke me up, in the way that it was meant to be, I guess. 
i guess
And I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member of the press?" And she told me, "Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned-in area, and I said, "Well, when do they go in?" 
well
My office was just a few blocks away. 
 just 
JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful and tragic and horrific and everything, but it was also as, in nature, an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue, and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather. 
well
I mean, there were afternoons I was down there, and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature, as time, is erasing this wound. 
i mean
The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim across a theater, and it's turning pink, you know, and down below there are hoses spraying, and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on, and I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?" 
you know
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars. 
 oh 
It's not like I can just check it in the lab. 
 just 
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers. 
you know
I never did this. I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom. 
 just 
:  You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult. 
 just 
Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay? 
okay
So the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components, which many people have done. 
 just 
So seeing this in practice, this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that, after a few years of development, we're now going into production with, and this is a full-time wheelchair user -- he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala, and you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain. 
you see
Again, the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast, he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke, and as the going gets tougher, he just slides his hands up the levers, creates more torque, and kind of bench-presses his way out of trouble through the rough terrain. 
 just 
Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors, all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain, stow them in the frame, and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair, and we sized it like a normal wheelchair, so it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway, it's low enough to fit under a table, and it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom 
 just 
and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet, and be able to transfer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair. 
 just 
The first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries. 
well
So because we tested it with wheelchair users, with wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them, not just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions, and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design, which we brought back to East Africa in '09 that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain, but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big, 
well
And these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world. 
 just 
And then you can also engage the end user in the design process, and not just ask him what he needs, but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved. 
 just 
Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health. 
well
Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens, have normal, or what we call corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay. 
well
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it with just your eyesight. 
 just 
Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab. 
okay
Okay, you get my point, right?  You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard? 
okay
Everybody begins to move around, and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track, you can track, and then when it stops, and there is a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not? 
 just 
That's what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention, which is what is shown in this video here. 
 just 
that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. 
well
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good. 
you know
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one. 
okay
Well, what we do in these training studies is, people come to the lab, they do tasks like this one, we then force them to play 10 hours of action games. 
well
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge. 
well
None of you.  And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun, it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize 
you know
I mean, think about how different cities are, actually. 
i mean
I mean, you have the typical European cities, with a dense urban core, good public transportation mostly, not a lot of road capacity. 
i mean
It's moving by itself, okay. 
okay
And the urban planner in London goes, "What do you mean, who's in charge of London's — I mean, no one is in charge." 
i mean
I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this." 
i mean
I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it. 
i mean
Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money, I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc., so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge. 
i mean
Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think, but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right? 
well
But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right? 
well
But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series in 2007. 
you see
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges, they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July, followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity. 
well
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with, and we actually got to do it twice. 
i mean
This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31, and you see the same street but now it's summer, and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year, and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this. 
you see
This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm, and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it. 
you see
No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges, meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that: 70 percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free. 
i mean
Okay. So why can that be? Why is that? 
okay
Well, think about it this way. Who changed? 
well
I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared, surely they must be discontent in a way. 
i mean
Well, so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out who changed, and where did they go? 
well
You should just nudge them in the right direction. 
 just 
Well, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did. 
well
And when we'd finished, he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward, and then he said, "Okay, everybody, hold on to your straws." 
okay
And I realized that this wasn't just my life. 
 just 
It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain. 
 just 
It was everybody's pain. And then I knew, just like before, that I had a choice. I could keep fighting this or I could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life. 
 just 
If I can't walk, then I might as well fly." 
well
They said, "You know, when do you want to come out?" 
you know
I said, "Well, I have to get a friend to drive me out because I can't drive. Sort of can't walk either. 
well
I said, "But I can use my hands," and he said, "Okay." 
okay
And Andrew said to me, as we got over the training area, "You see that mountain over there?" 
you see
And he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain." 
well
And I spent every moment I could out at that flying school, way out of my comfort zone, all these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots, you know, and little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast, and then my steel brace, my baggy overalls, my bag of medication and catheters and my limp, and they used to look at me and think, "Oh, who is she kidding? She's never going to be able to do this." 
you know
And then I found myself back at that same school where I'd gone for that very first flight, teaching other people how to fly, just under 18 months after I'd left the spinal ward. 
 just 
The pilot light inside of me was still a light, just as it is in each and every one of us. 
 just 
When's the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend? 
 just 
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge, but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task, or maybe turning your digital senses totally off. 
 just 
And some of these people believe that in that struggle, it is sometimes okay to take up arms. 
okay
And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous, so monstrous, and had such great impact, that his definition was the one that stuck, not just here in the West. 
 just 
We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean. 
 just 
But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world, his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance. 
 just 
The supply of money — just as important, more important perhaps — the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling. 
 just 
So I think we've come to a point now where we can say that, just like all politics, all jihad is local. 
 just 
He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites. 
well
The good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need we already have, and we are very good at giving: economic assistance, not just money, but expertise, technology, knowhow, private investment, fair terms of trade, medicine, education, technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective, for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient. 
 just 
I live in New York now. Just this week, posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage. 
 just 
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.  It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV. 
you see
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. 
 just 
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles. 
well
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be. 
 just 
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars. 
well
I'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean, because it ain't about being heard, just being seen. 
 just 
Got to do what I can to make sure I look good, and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man, I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside. 
well
I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see. 
 just 
Had my pistol and knew just what to do. 
 just 
Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind. 
 just 
And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room, and I read him one of my pieces, and you know what he told me? 
you know
You know what the problem is with you, homie? 
you know
I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression. 
 just 
And I said to him, "Listen, punk fool, you're a failed actor who became an agent, and you know why you failed as an actor? 
you know
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment. 
well
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells. 
okay
We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells, by adding a few genes to them, culturing them, and then harvesting them. 
okay
So some people think that these models sound well and good, but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?" 
well
Well, this is another trend in the field. 
well
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics, the field is actually evolving towards just that, a model of the entire ecosystem of the body, complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart. 
 just 
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there, and so, watch out. 
 just 
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed, you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path: disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials, and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all. 
 just 
Well, things have changed. 
well
Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95, before antiretroviral drugs. 
you see
This is what you see today, and this is in developing countries, so what that means is, unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now, we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis, because new drugs are developed, new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries. 
you see
So you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product, unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available, you will probably choose to do something else. 
you know
So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken, and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung. 
well
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy. 
well
Okay, so what we've got so far is, what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls. 
okay
How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line. 
well
Well, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky, some of which you and I can't see. 
well
Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues. 
well
You know, like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well, but they don't know it that well. 
well
 I go, "You're the driver, you should know." He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir." 
 just 
I go, "You just arrived at the W?" "No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."  "I was on my way home from the airport, I got a job. I'm working already." 
 just 
You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region. 
you know
Every country is different and it's confusing, okay? 
okay
 I told him, I said, "No, no, I was just in Lebanon." 
 just 
He goes, "I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are, please." 
 just 
"Abdul, are you okay?" "I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right." 
okay
 "Habibi, it's so hot. Just come here for a second. Say hello. 
 just 
Hello, Habibi. Just don't move. Just stay there, please. 
 just 
So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim, so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos, everyone, if you're brown --  Here's my advice to my brown friends. 
you know
The next time you're on an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue. 
 just 
And what that means is just constant, huge volumes of data going up. 
 just 
They were well respected. They were known. 
well
It's like the de facto real-time newswire, if you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter. 
you know
Well, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for. 
well
Video: Getting real windy in just a second. 
 just 
Markham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something you'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold. 
okay
So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella, there's a white lilo in the pool, there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool, and there's two trees in the background. 
 um
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer, and sure enough, there's the white lilo, there are the two trees, there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo. 
 um
We go to the dam that we talked about, we start just literally going through every time that road crosses the river, crossing off the bridges that don't match. 
 just 
And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things, and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly. 
i guess
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy, and joy, after all, is the end of life. 
 just 
 The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point, the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean, took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down, you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension, as I sat in a helicopter thundering north, and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom. 
 just 
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn, and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified. 
 just 
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. 
i guess
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing, you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor, rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where the real meat of life is to be found, the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days. 
you know
Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do, but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer, there is something addictive about this, and in my case, I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit. 
 just 
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole. 
 just 
When I talk about Antarctica, people often say, "Hasn't, you know, that's interesting, hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?" 
you know
Or, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know. 
you know
I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before. 
well
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside. 
 just 
The incorporated side, the company, is doing things that it does really well. 
well
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale, significant and long-term resource investment, the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds, and for individuals, consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse that we really want as consumers, and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise, and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation. 
well
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent of 2,500 TGV trains, and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car. 
 just 
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched, and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars? 
 just 
And not just easy things that anyone can do. 
 just 
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary, and after seven years, last year it delivered 530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects. 
 just 
But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had the "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right, and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks. 
you know
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right. 
 just 
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers, trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom, and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history. 
 just 
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply. 
 just 
And the peers also become, peers and owners create relationships, and so at the last minute people can -- a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car, is it available?" And that person will say, "Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it." 
you know
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention. 
well
When this happened, a part of me thought, well, what's the big deal? 
well
So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end, it's just a news story. 
 just 
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time, and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves. 
you see
At the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article. 
you see
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain. 
 just 
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning, and that's that the insula does a lot. 
 just 
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula, you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list, and it's a really long list. 
you see
There's just one problem. 
 just 
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it, don't just take them at their word. 
 just 
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now, and we have people, you know, afraid. 
you know
So at some point it became, you know, to me, I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. 
you know
And later on in the night, I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night, and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots, you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before. 
you know
And everybody's crying now.  So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex, as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody what I'd just seen, and people started to see them and to share them, and that's how it started. 
you know
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work, but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel who want to say something. 
 just 
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster. 
 just 
It's not just one dude making one poster, it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it. 
 just 
It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense. 
you know
I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends to come, graphic designers most of them, to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time. 
i mean
she starts -- she said that she changed her mind, and now she loves that blue, she loves that star, and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag, and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster. 
 just 
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news. 
you see
And suddenly, there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news, they say, "Okay, let's talk about this." 
okay
And they just came, and it was so much, I remember one day, Michal, she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him, "Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody." 
 just 
At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today. 
 just 
And we were just at the beginning of the story. 
 just 
Every time a country started talking about it, like Germany, America, wherever, a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories, so at the beginning sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran? 
okay
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago. 
 just 
So for five months now, that's what we are doing, me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images. 
 just 
We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us. 
 just 
I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe, I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland, from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came, and we just met there for the first time in real life. 
 just 
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands, and have a coffee and a nice discussion, and we talk about food and basketball. 
 just 
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran, lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us, decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel, and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says, "Okay, not that big a deal." 
okay
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message, but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it. 
i mean
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you." 
you know
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but, this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — " I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years, and I know how it looks from the ground. 
i mean
We can just send a message and hope for the best. 
 just 
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images. 
 just 
And I'm just going to take a picture of it, and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something. 
 just 
He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming, it's going to come at the beginning of 2013. 
you know
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due, so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart, reports of phone calls that aren't going well, people saying nothing's happening at all, and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's, we're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything." 
well
They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority." 
 just 
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy, and at every moment, different partisans saying, "Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse," and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy. 
 just 
So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem. 
 just 
We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis, and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis. 
 just 
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal. 
well
And I like to think, when I picture how Republicans see the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly well-engineered machine, some perfect machine. 
well
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government, a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying and cheating and hurting each other, maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department and an army, but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery. 
you know
And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning economists picture this economy, most Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists, they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time. 
you know
Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors, seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it. 
 just 
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan, and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend, we don't care, spend some more, and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending. 
 just 
We get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment, but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues, we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say. 
 just 
The 20th century, the last hundred years, is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful, awful job, so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty. 
 just 
And this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now, I think what is most maddening about it is, if Congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other, not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise, but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise, we all instantly are better off. 
 just 
And so just the act of compromise itself, and sustained, real compromise, would give us even more time, would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road. 
 just 
So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise, to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us, but to just talk about it like what it is, not an existential crisis, not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views, but a math problem, a really solvable math problem, 
 just 
one where we're not all going to get what we want and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around. 
you know
Second doctor: We're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.First doctor: Well, do you want to sit up? That's fine. 
well
Second doctor: And good, just take it nice and slow, Jake. 
 just 
Well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.First doctor: You feeling light-headed or dizzy at all? 
well
["'Alice in Wonderland' "] ["Academy Award Nominee for Visual Effects"] ["'The Lost World' "] ["Stop Motion Animation"] ["'Jurassic Park' "] [Dinosaur roars] ["CG Animation"] ["Academy Award Winner for Visual Effects"] ["'The Smurfs' "] ["Autodesk Maya Software - Key Frame Animation"] ["'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' "] Chimpanzee: No! ["Academy Award Nominee for Visual Effects"] ["'Metropolis' "]  ["'Blade Runner' "] ["Academy Award Nominee for Visual Effects"] ["'The Rains Came' "] Rama Safti: Well, it's all over. 
well
And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito that's carrying that virus. Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms. 
well
To give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened, in the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, "We have no Aedes aegypti," and currently they spend about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it, just one species of mosquito. 
 just 
I mean, that can't be very difficult. 
i mean
It's just not practical. 
 just 
Well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population. 
well
There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there. 
 just 
You just want to get this one. 
 just 
Well, the result has been very good. 
well
And in fact, the numbers after that get, those get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left. 
 just 
And we've got a production unit in Oxford, or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos. 
 just 
So that's where we stand at the moment, and I've just got a few final thoughts, which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area, and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms, and when you think about genetic engineering, we've now got enzymes for industrial processing, enzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food. 
 just 
I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable. 
well
This graph shows the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see, if you go all the way back to the founding, we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War. 
you see
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way." 
you see
Now how did we do this? How did we go from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years? 
 just 
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations. 
you see
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis, so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is, you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues. 
you know
Do you know why they do this? 
you know
Well, in the last 12 years it's become much more apparent that it is. 
well
So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know, Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life. 
you know
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale. 
you know
But when you look at cross-party ratings, you find, well, that it's lower, but actually, when I first saw this data, I was surprised. 
well
The moral electromagnet is turning back on, and nowadays, just very recently, Democrats really dislike Republicans. 
 just 
We will never again have just three television networks, all of which are relatively centrist. 
 just 
I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here. 
 just 
So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional, hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is, do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place, and when you have closed party primaries, and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting, you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans. 
well
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this, where there's just so much stuff coming in, it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody, we've got to just work together, just start shooting." 
 just 
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization, is actually this fourth asteroid, rising non-marital births. 
well
But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos. 
 just 
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders, we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together. 
 just 
Okay, almost all of you. 
okay
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club, which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point. 
well
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men. 
 just 
Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money. 
well
So when I began to dive, in 2005, I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does, but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure, completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair. 
 just 
But well before my imagination was my vocation, my imagination saved my life. 
well
But I had my grandparents, my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley, who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own, after they had already raised five children. 
 just 
And I just, I can just remember the love that she offered us as her students. 
 just 
So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school, and I would take out pieces of paper, and I would staple them together, and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination. 
 just 
And I just flourished here. 
 just 
I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day. 
 just 
Well, in English class, in ninth grade, my friend John, who was sitting next to me, laughed a little bit too hard. 
well
My grandfather's just going to kill me." 
 just 
And we sat in silence for that brief moment, and he said to me, "You're really talented."  "You're really good. You know, the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist. 
you know
And I took the headmaster to task and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down that this wasn't about me, but all these years later it was totally me. 
 just 
Well, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade. 
well
I just wanted a video camera. 
 just 
And all the color just drained from his face, and he looked at me, and he said, "Forget everything you learned." 
 just 
and I started writing books for young readers Well, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design. 
well
Because he had just invested a significant amount of money in my college education. 
 just 
And he said, "Well, who pays you for that?" 
well
And I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet. 
 just 
Now, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground, and this kid who was just this really hyper kid, I started calling him "Monkey Boy," and I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy." 
 just 
My friend described it as a wake, but happy, because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me, but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books. 
 just 
I just finished the ninth book in the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime. 
 just 
Lunch ladies treat me really well. 
well
I've seen people have "Punk Farm" birthday parties, people have dressed up as "Punk Farm" for Halloween, a "Punk Farm" baby room, which makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term. 
well
And it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing, and you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch. 
you know
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results, they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections. 
well
Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation. 
well
But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain. 
 just 
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises. 
 just 
Well, having found that and published that, I thought, well, what's it doing? 
well
Well, I'm an experimental dermatologist, so what we did was we thought we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight. 
well
In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it. 
well
So we thought we'd just kind of model -- Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year, so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide -- the nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin -- cleave to release NO. 
 just 
In summer, you might as well be at the equator. 
well
Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount. 
well
We think that the skin -- well, we know that the skin has got very large stores of nitric oxide as these various other forms. 
well
And this is ongoing work, but dermatologists -- I mean, I'm a dermatologist. 
i mean
I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight. 
well
Now just this past year, one of our partners, the American College of Surgeons, teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS -certified before they do minimally invasive surgery. 
 just 
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada? 
 just 
We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages, and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital. 
 just 
If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren't enough translators in the world. 
 just 
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week. 
 just 
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world. 
 just 
Maybe we have something to learn as well. 
well
They have to be able to teach us something as well. 
well
We have a need to learn as well as to teach. 
well
Don't they just pop into your head? 
 just 
Well you might have, but I don't think so. 
well
If you have kids, you know what I mean. 
you know
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand, making mountains and seas -- well, not seas, but different things -- people and dogs, etc. 
well
They aren't told by their boss or anyone, they just do it. 
 just 
You know this gentleman, right? 
you know
Then my teacher said, "Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling." 
well
There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified. 
well
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper? 
 just 
You know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it? 
you know
"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes." 
 just 
"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you," is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway." 
well
But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything. 
 just 
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack. 
 just 
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it. 
you know
It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks." 
 um
If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare. 
you see
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make. 
you see
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions. 
 just 
They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out. 
 just 
Well, there were a couple of reasons. 
well
You know, in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness. 
you know
Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science. 
i mean
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't. 
well
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story. 
you know
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God. 
 just 
I'm just trying to tell a story." 
 just 
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. 
 just 
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it. 
 just 
There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple, understandable ways. 
 just 
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. 
 just 
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers, it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses. 
 just 
Well, she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room. 
well
So this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums. 
 just 
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed, because national e-markets will deliver data. 
well
So in the search box I typed in "Mother's Day," and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website, many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself. 
 just 
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would. 
 just 
What do I mean by fluent? 
i mean
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas. 
i mean
I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives." 
i mean
You know, in recent years, there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. 
you know
You know, just at the beginning of this year, at the turn of the new year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012. 
you know
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together. 
 just 
After you've created your program, you can click on "share," and then share your project with other people, so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well. 
well
And it doesn't just stay on the screen. 
 just 
But instead of just playing someone else's game, you get to create the games, and if you see someone else's game, you can just say "see inside," and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it. 
you see
But that's just where it starts. 
 just 
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this, they're learning important concepts like variables, but that's just the start. 
 just 
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts, he was also learning about the process of design, how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project like you see here. 
you see
So he was learning many different core principles of design, about how to experiment with new ideas, how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts, how to collaborate with other people on your projects, about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong, how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well. 
well
Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding. 
 just 
When you become fluent with reading and writing, it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. 
 just 
And it's not just about your work life. 
 just 
Let me end with just one more example. 
 just 
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh. 
you see
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. 
you know
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said? 
 just 
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy. 
well
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo. 
 just 
Well to start to do this, we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. 
well
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. 
well
Well it requires software, it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. 
well
Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine. 
well
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. 
well
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED, and it was called "The power of time off," and he spoke about how every seven years, he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired, and I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off. 
 just 
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life, chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until, you know, I can't record them anymore. 
you know
So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me, because it's something that I really wanted to -- from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted to keep this project going until forever, and having missed that one second, I realized, it just kind of created this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again. 
 just 
When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s. 
 just 
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that, as the days and weeks and months go by, time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and, you know, I hated that, and visualization is the way to trigger memory. 
you know
You know, this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done. 
you know
Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day. 
 just 
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose, but I'll just have to narrow it down to one, but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway. 
 just 
It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest, against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you. 
 just 
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit, back in the day, and I've decided that the best way for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person, is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of, "Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert." 
 just 
And it just takes a quick, quick second. 
 just 
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life, just driving around the U.S. and Canada and just figuring out where to go the next day, and it was kind of outstanding. 
 just 
And I found that it's actually been very, very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment. 
 just 
It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one, I think it's important to remember it, just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days. 
 just 
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day. 
 just 
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now -- most people in this room, I bet -- and it's something that's -- I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived, and this is my way of doing that, if you could just type in on a website, "June 18, 2018," and you would just see a stream of people's lives on that particular day from all over the world. 
 just 
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities, and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day, so you can never forget that that day, you lived. 
 just 
I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities, and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics, and I see part of my job today, the reason for being here, not just to campaign for my party, but for politics, and the role it can play for the better in our lives. 
 just 
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act. 
 just 
"Well," I told him, "the surroundings do not meet European standards, even though this is not what we want, but we will choose the colors ourselves, because this is exactly what we want. 
well
And if you do not let us continue with our work, I will hold a press conference here, right now, right in this road, and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era." 
 just 
One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored, and where we were in the process of planting trees, when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop. 
 just 
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered. 
well
But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks. 
 just 
"I'm convinced," I told a German official with the World Bank, if they worked in Germany, in a German administration, just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes, they would be bribed just the same." 
 just 
Politics is not just about leaders. 
 just 
It's not just about politicians and laws. 
 just 
When people say nothing can change, just stop and think what the world was like 10, 20, 50, 100 years ago. 
 just 
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people, because we test students with problems they haven't seen before. 
you know
But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. 
you know
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well. 
well
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well. 
well
And then we can debate, you know, is it better to be there, where performance is strong at the price of large disparities? 
you know
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. 
you see
But that's not what you see. 
you see
Spending per student only explains about, well, less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries, and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system, doesn't do particularly well. 
well
What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results. 
you see
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson. 
well
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. 
well
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. 
you know
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. 
you know
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. 
well
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries. 
you know
that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees. 
well
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. 
 just 
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well, but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. 
well
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement. 
well
And you can see other countries as well. 
well
And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture, of economic factors, of social issues, of homogeneity of societies, and so on, these people must now concede that education improvement is possible. 
 just 
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture. 
you know
And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it, but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school. 
you know
But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture. 
 just 
You know, students are divided up, reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards. 
you know
When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics, students in North America would typically tell us, you know, it's all about talent. 
you know
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. 
well
You know, some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards. 
you know
You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.  But PISA has shown what's possible in education. 
 just 
These are just a few examples. 
 just 
Well, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. 
well
This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. 
 just 
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird, you just focus on the rules of interaction. 
 just 
Well, as ownership is related to control, as I shall explain later, looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like, who are the key players? 
well
Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data, because a foundational guideline in science is: Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that. 
okay
Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the core only, but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue Okay, so now we analyzed the structure, so how does this relate to the control? 
okay
Well, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders. 
well
Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value. 
well
Well, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. 
well
But this journey has only just begun, so we will have to wait before we see the first results. 
 just 
But this is just my own personal ideology. 
 just 
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it, and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty. 
you know
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back. 
 just 
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is. 
by the way
And then the third group of answers usually would be: when I'm surprised, when we laugh together, as somebody said to me in the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots. 
you know
What parts of you are just being seen? 
 just 
What do you seek to express there? 
you see
It isn't just a behavior. 
 just 
You know, animals have sex. 
you know
We are the only ones who can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody, just because we can imagine it. 
 just 
And people began to say, "I turn myself off when I feel dead inside, when I don't like my body, when I feel old, when I haven't had time for myself, when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you, when I don't perform well at work, when I feel low self esteem, when I don't have a sense of self-worth, when I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take, 
well
Because most of the time, people like to ask the question, "You turn me on, what turns me on," and I'm out of the question, you know? 
you know
You know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct. 
you know
It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc., maybe where you leave the Agile program --  And you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible. 
 just 
Responsibility and desire just butt heads. 
 just 
They don't really do well together. 
well
And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth, which is the myth of spontaneity, which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship, already has. 
 just 
So all the way over on the left of this graph, what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year, and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year. 
you see
What my language would have forced me to do, instead of just telling you, "This is my uncle," is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information. 
 just 
So many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language. 
you know
Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature. 
well
What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages. 
you see
And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break. 
 just 
Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence, the demographics -- what sex, their age -- their income level within their own country, their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure. 
well
Well, think about smoking, for example. 
well
My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak. 
 just 
And here we are, out of billions of neurons, just recording, 10 years ago, a hundred. 
 just 
And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message And if we can actually provide feedback, sensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator back to the brain, how the brain deals with that, of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery. 
well
Well, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw, and doing a thousand trials a day and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice, we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making. 
well
Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface and have Aurora play the game just by thinking, without interference of her body. 
 just 
So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now, this is the exact first moment she got that. 
you see
That's the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate and could act outside, in that outside world, just by controlling an artificial device. 
 just 
Well, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm. 
well
The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later, after the first video that I showed to you, is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. 
you see
Well, we did that 10 years ago. 
well
You can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar. 
 just 
And in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense. 
 just 
So what you see here is this is the design of the task. 
you see
The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey. 
you see
And by the way, they don't read English anyway, so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position. 
 just 
So when we look at the brains of these animals, on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells showing what happens with the brain activity, the electrical storms, of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick. 
you see
Well, in an experiment that we ran a few years ago, we took this to the limit. 
well
Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world. 
well
And I was five years old, and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job; after all, they were very proficient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe, as my grandmother used to tell me, that "impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true." 
 just 
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them. 
you know
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. 
 just 
 But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work, that's what I thought, compared to what I was doing in the farm. 
 just 
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade, and that was a transition for me to go to high school. 
 just 
Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass. 
well
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay, you'll go to school after the ceremony." 
well
Well, while I was in high school, something happened. 
well
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are," because this man looked very happy, and I admired that. 
well
"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?" 
well
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone." 
well
As I spoke to the women, they told me, "You know what we need? We really need a school for girls." 
you know
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education. 
well
Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft, you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces, you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight, and you need a controller, and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit. 
well
Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air. 
well
Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't. 
well
Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons, but is that a fair metric? 
well
But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse. 
 just 
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence, and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military, so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay? 
okay
So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice, they're at least as clever as pigeons.  Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons. 
 just 
It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons. 
 just 
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect. 
well
This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba, and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small -- you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about, where the nucleus of the neuron is? 
you know
I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well. 
well
Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world, we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators. 
well
You allow them to steer towards the little stripe, and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever. 
 just 
Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators, just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs. 
well
But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain. 
 just 
So I really think that, as we learn more, it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion, and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons. 
 just 
So these basic concepts of multitasking in time and multitasking in space, I think these are things that are true in our brains as well, but I think the insects are the true masters of this. 
well
Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time. 
 just 
It said that the pace of business was quickening -- and by the way, this was in 1986 -- and the most successful companies were flexible. 
by the way
So following the agile model, we ask three questions: What worked well in our family this week, what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead? 
well
What worked well this week? 
well
What didn't work well? Our math sheets, or greeting visitors at the door. 
well
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out, I mean at least not that are revealing. 
i mean
You know, the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves, and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids. 
you know
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed. 
you know
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins. 
by the way
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what? 
you know
Let's just take a few examples. 
 just 
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?" 
okay
Now give us a punishment. Okay. 
okay
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax. 
you see
  And by the way, research backs this up too. 
by the way
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple "what do you know" test. 
you know
Do you know where your grandparents were born? 
you know
Do you know where your parents went to high school? 
you know
Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it? 
you know
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives. 
you know
I've mentioned just three here today: Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story. 
 just 
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion. 
well
You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick. 
 just 
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated. 
 just 
Well, the clerks are the computers. 
well
Well, that's today, but we don't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like. 
well
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident. 
well
At the same time, we also had lots of parents, rich people, who had computers, and who used to tell me, "You know, my son, I think he's gifted, because he does wonderful things with computers. 
you know
I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office, and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one, didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was. 
 just 
So I said, "Well that's impossible, because -- How is it possible? They don't know anything." 
well
 So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?" 
you know
Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her. 
you know
So then people said, well, how far will it go? 
well
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you before you decided that you can't understand anything?" 
okay
So a little girl who you see just now, she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English, she said, "Well, apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease, we haven't understood anything else." 
well
Whenever they do anything, you just say, 'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that? 
well
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.' You know what grannies do." 
you know
Well, we know what they're like today. 
well
When you're standing in a trench all alone, if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed. 
okay
Okay? 
okay
Grandmother: Well done! Very good. 
well
Well, I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments. 
well
It's been tried all over the world, and teachers sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?" 
 just 
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?" 
you know
And if he says, "Well, what? how?" 
well
And I've got to -- hang on, I've got to get this wording exactly right, because, you know, it's very important. 
you know
And just one last thing. 
 just 
And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child. 
you know
The first problem that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is, how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy? 
 just 
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?" 
well
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse." 
 just 
And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years, or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company, we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers, said they would offer unprecedented concessions, sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. 
 just 
It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music, or a band playing sad music, probably both.  And this guy comes up to me, and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on, and he had his two daughters with him, and he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters." 
 just 
And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion, and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories that closed in the first decade of this century. 
 just 
So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top? 
well
Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China. 
well
You might say the solar states, the sun belt, we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country, and maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create an industry cluster in California to be able to produce the solar panels so that we're not buying them from China but we're buying them from the U.S." 
well
You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation. 
you see
In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West, they could do geothermal, or you could look at Texas and say, we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid. 
 just 
We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying. 
 just 
Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say, "Okay, great idea, but really? 
okay
What if several of the high-net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create, band together, just a couple of them, and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond? 
 just 
Because, dear TEDsters, if you are impatient like I am, you know that our economic competitors, our other nations, are in the game and are eating us for lunch. 
you know
And as usual, the band was psyched, but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. 
 just 
Well, maybe it's for you. 
well
I just want you to have this money." 
 just 
And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street. 
 just 
So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other. 
 just 
Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space, and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. 
well
Generally, what you see in green is not desertifying, and what you see in brown is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. 
you see
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them, you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae, leading to increased runoff and evaporation. 
 just 
Now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments in Africa where I grew up, and I loved wildlife, and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. 
you see
Well, I have news for you. 
well
We were once just as certain that the world was flat. 
 just 
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting, drum-beating people to protect the animals, than the land began to deteriorate, as you see in this park that we formed. 
you see
Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here, and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter, plant litter. 
 just 
But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago? 
 just 
It has just come through four months of rain, and it's now going into eight months of dry season. 
 just 
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground before the next growing season, and if it doesn't, the grassland and the soil begin to die. 
you see
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. 
okay
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground. 
 just 
Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science, and that had accelerated desertification, as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States, and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government. 
you see
It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season. 
 just 
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended, and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid. 
 just 
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. 
okay
This was another site where it had been bare and eroding, and at the base of the marked small tree, we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay? 
okay
And again, watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature. 
 just 
 I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland, and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. 
you see
The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. 
you see
We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents, and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that, for illustrative purposes, if we do what I am showing you here, we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years, and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands 
 just 
I'm just going to ask you one quick question. 
 just 
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time, and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation, where it's 100 percent bare. 
well
But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe, where I offered a £5 note in a hundred-mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred-mile drive, and on that, we trebled the stocking rate, the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding, just by the movement, mimicking nature, and using a sigmoid curve, that principle. 
 just 
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that. 
 just 
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea. 
well
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. 
well
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. 
 just 
The Johnson Sea-Link --  -- which you can probably just barely hear here, uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet. 
 just 
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. 
 just 
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate 
 just 
Edith Widder : Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there. 
 oh 
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me, now you don't -- and we had four such teasing appearances, and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us. 
you see
 Narrator:  Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa! 
 oh 
I know because I've been shot down so many times, I get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself. 
 just 
Are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat, when people say things like, "Kids can be cruel." 
 just 
And social business needs markets, and there are some issues for which you just can't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market. 
 just 
Some people say, "Well, that's just because those MBA types are greedy." 
well
Our attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated, you know, to air at four o'clock in the morning, I'm okay with that. 
well
Well, you and I know when you prohibit failure, you kill innovation. 
well
Well, you put those five things together -- you can't use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector; you can't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for-profit sector does for new customers; you can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for-profit sector takes; you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector; and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this, 
well
even if you could do it in the first place -- and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector, on every level. 
 just 
Well, like most fanatical dogma in America, these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs. 
well
Well, charity became their answer. 
well
I'm going to just focus on two. 
 just 
So we've all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that, well, the less money you spend on fundraising, the more money there is available for the cause. 
well
Well, that's true if it's a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger. 
well
Why? Well, the short story is, our sponsors split on us. 
well
But if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP, up just one step to three percent of GDP, by investing in that growth, that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions, and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities, because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth, that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector. 
 just 
And if that can be our generation's enduring legacy -- that we took responsibility for the thinking that had been handed down to us, that we revisited it, we revised it, and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things, forever, for everyone -- well, I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be. 
well
So raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness. 
you know
But that can't be the answer, because these drugs actually don't work all that well. 
well
Well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion. 
well
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way. 
 just 
It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup. 
 just 
Do these organisms even have emotion-like states, or are they just little digital robots? 
 just 
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well. 
well
Well, one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion-like states such as arousal, and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties. 
well
So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table, you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away, and it seems to keep getting irritated. 
you know
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation. 
 just 
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license — oh my God --  — we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do, and that's also reminiscent of ADHD, which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin that act similarly to cocaine. 
 oh 
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities. 
you know
As Seymour showed back in the 1970s, flies, like songbirds, as you just heard, are capable of learning. 
 just 
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies, they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. 
well
On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body, the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well, but they're still hyperactive. 
well
So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup, and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup. 
 just 
If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects, putting the oil back in our mental engines, just where it's needed. Thank you very much. 
 just 
But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades. 
 just 
Well, commercial hunting happened. 
well
It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. 
 just 
Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there. 
well
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway. 
well
Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here. 
okay
There's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon. 
 just 
There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species, they're recreating extinct ecosystems in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii. 
 just 
The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle, and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed. 
 just 
This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes, but Alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then, and this will move ahead, and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern Spain. 
well
Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens, so most of that is already in their DNA, but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds. 
well
You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there. 
you see
There were just 254 left. 
 just 
You know, do you want extinct species back? 
you know
I suspect there are some people out there sitting, kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, there's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way. 
well
Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct, and many of them were keystone species, and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is, so when these things come back, they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love. 
well
I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work. 
you know
CA: Well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling. 
well
Three thousand years ago, civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile, some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance, smelling of sheep shit, I guess, proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne, "We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you." 
 just 
Wow. Wow.  Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that. 
 just 
This is Michael and Benedicta, and they're alive thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing -- and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support, whether you know it or not. 
you know
And if you live on less than $1.25 a day, if you live in that kind of poverty, this is not just data. 
 just 
How about that?  And 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner. 
 just 
I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away. 
well
Well, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy. 
well
And it's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero, just doing the things that we know work. 
 just 
2030? By 2030, robots, not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it. 
 just 
So I'm here to -- I guess we're here to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus, the one we call factivism. 
i guess
I guess we in the One Campaign would love you to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on. 
i guess
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. 
you know
So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials. 
 just 
Well first of all, because I am a maker. 
well
Secondly, and just as important, innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers. 
 just 
["Paper speakers"] What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet. 
 just 
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community, let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days. 
 just 
Now, it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. 
 just 
So I picked think.com, but then I thought, you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there. 
you know
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. 
 just 
 That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days, and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network, but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself. 
 just 
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet. 
well
Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake, and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work, but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to, and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes. 
 just 
I mean, everything off, it's like the service call you get from the cable company, Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today. 
i mean
because they work so well, they're cheap, they're repeated, and so on. 
well
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet, it's just somebody's guess. 
you see
So there's been plenty of people, plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years, but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well. 
well
So I think that, if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet, and how vulnerable it is, we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist, and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it, I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built. 
 just 
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university. 
well
There's just no way around Newton's third law. 
 just 
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy, but you think the math can still work out intelligently -- by combining light body, heavy battery, you can still gain spectacular efficiency. 
i mean
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops.  EM: I mean, you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour, under normal conditions, 250 miles is a reasonable number. 
i mean
Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way. 
by the way
So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car, so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one, and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens, like the car has ESP. 
 just 
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car. 
i mean
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute, you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home. 
i mean
Do you see that coming, really, truly, or just on a few key routes? 
you see
By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive from L.A. to New York just using the Supercharger network, which charges at five times the rate of anything else. 
 just 
Wait for an hour, but the good news is, you're helping save the planet, and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything. 
by the way
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption, so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. 
well
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is. 
i mean
We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun, and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization. 
 just 
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas. 
well
And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there. 
 just 
I mean, how do you, the company, benefit? 
i mean
EM: Well, essentially, SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say, a company or a bank. 
well
CA: Just between us.  EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago, so in roughly 18 years, I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source. 
 just 
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet. 
i guess
And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one. 
well
EM: Well, we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe, the engines, the electronics and the launch operation. 
well
Obviously that doesn't work very well for — CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land? 
well
So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology, and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take, at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale. 
i guess
CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable," how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw. 
 just 
So that's just to give a sense of scale. 
 just 
I work a lot. I mean, a lot. 
i mean
CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right. 
well
You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times. 
you see
I mean, almost no one can do that. 
i mean
Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking. 
well
It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. 
you know
Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy. 
i mean
Look at that.  Just take a bow. That was fantastic. 
 just 
Well, there do seem to be a few. 
well
Well, congratulations, because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy, you are now in excess of the average life span of somebody who was born in 1900. 
well
Turns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing, because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while. 
 just 
Well, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy? 
well
Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way, and the rains come and the lightning flashes, and oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water and the swimmer gets into trouble, and, uh oh, the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized, and that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks, and maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across. 
 uh 
Well, what does this really look like? 
well
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway? 
well
Ultimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these, and if all goes well, 14 years after you started, you will get one approval. 
well
Well, let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked. 
well
One that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis. 
 just 
That picture you see there? 
you see
Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology, and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome, the ability to be able to look at a chromosome, to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA, and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code, the A's, C's, G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things, 
well
Well, that's exciting. 
well
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways, it was possible to pick one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful and try it out. 
well
In an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon, if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria, and you watch to see what happened, in just 72 hours, that cell becomes, for all purposes that we can determine, almost like a normal cell. 
 just 
Well that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being? 
well
And the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this, 28 of them, and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease, all looking quite similar to each other. 
you see
Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways. 
well
But when there is something that I really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of, like marching band or umpiring, we always find a way to do it, and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life. 
 um
What would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well? 
well
FC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today to be here, and he is —  -- He is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade in his school in Boston. 
by the way
SB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy. 
well
 So I just want to say a couple more things about that particular story, and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases, as Sam says, these 4,000 that are waiting for answers. 
 just 
Turned out, it didn't work very well for cancer, but it has exactly the right properties, the right shape, to work for progeria, and that's what's happened. 
well
It didn't work very well for cancer, but became the first successful antiretroviral, and you can see from the table there are others as well. 
well
Well, we have to come up with a partnership between academia, government, the private sector, and patient organizations to make that so. 
well
It just started last December, and this is one of its goals. 
 just 
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip. 
you see
Second, we need new kinds of partnerships between academia and government and the private sector and patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here, in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds. 
 just 
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam. 
 just 
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called "Cloudburst," which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment. 
 just 
Now fast forward to just three years ago. 
 just 
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, "Water Night," another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries. 
 just 
  [The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.] [Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.] [But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?] [Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?] [The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.] 
well
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of." 
 just 
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right. 
 just 
He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health. 
 just 
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well, and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited. 
well
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything. 
 just 
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it. 
 just 
And it's not just water that this works with. 
 just 
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well. 
well
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. 
well
It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off. 
 um
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head. 
i mean
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well. 
well
Okay, here's two theories about how people might think about this, and then we'll see some data. 
okay
This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way. 
by the way
And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there. 
by the way
Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well. 
well
They're just choosing randomly. 
 just 
So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer. 
you see
And you see activity in some regions we've seen today, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, an area that's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says," and also the right and left temporoparietal junction. 
you see
On the top you see the one-step players. 
you see
The bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC. 
you see
Okay. Get ready. 
okay
Boring. It's just not interesting neurally. 
 just 
You see on the left, when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars, they disagree about half the time, and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often. 
you see
Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time, so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously, just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you'd expect common activity in language regions when they're actually kind of listening and communicating. 
 just 
This is a young chimp. The young ones are better than the old ones, just like humans. 
 just 
Not only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way. 
well
Okay, so the next part of this study I'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa. 
okay
If Matt's in the audience, I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second, this character from your series. 
 just 
In order to run in the general election, you must do extremely well in the Lester election. 
well
You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well. 
well
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt, but it's dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people. 
okay
Okay. That's Lesterland. 
okay
In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote, the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland, the trick is, to run in the general election, you must do extremely well in the money election. 
well
But you must do extremely well. 
well
And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland. 
 just 
Well, here are the numbers from 2010: .26 percent of America gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate, .05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate, .01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent -- gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates, and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic is .000042 percent — for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans — 
well
gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending. 
 just 
So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers, and I say it's fair for me to say it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America. 
 just 
Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials. We have a general election, but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election. 
well
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one. 
okay
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society. 
you know
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this. 
you know
Okay. So how do we do it? 
okay
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives. 
 just 
Okay. But even if you're not yet with me, even if you believe this is impossible, what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me as I've spoken about this issue again and again is, even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant. 
okay
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do? 
 just 
 And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible, what this love of country says back is, "That's just irrelevant." 
 just 
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay, and that it grows, and basically it means I collect dead animals. 
okay
 And in those days, I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass. 
 just 
Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist. 
well
 I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine, but to share this among your peers is something different. 
i mean
I mean, the question I ask myself, why does this happen in nature? 
i mean
Well, what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation. 
well
And here you see a dead duck. 
you see
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years -- that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged? 
well
And as you know, or as you may not know, this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world. 
you know
It's incredible just how light this thing is. 
 just 
I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go. 
i mean
And if they said yes, we gave them a new one, and as they were building it, we took apart the one that they just finished. 
 just 
And by the way, we should point out that this was not big meaning. 
by the way
People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition, people would probably build one more Bionicle. 
 just 
So people understand that meaning is important, they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance, the extent to which it's important. 
 just 
And I described to them some of these Lego experiments, and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment. 
 just 
If the CEO, just like our participants, thought the essence of meaning is unimportant, then he [wouldn't] care. 
 just 
And he would say, "At the moment I directed you in this way, and now that I'm directing you in this way, everything will be okay." 
okay
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side. 
 just 
But I should point out, by the way, that in the shredder condition, people could have cheated. 
by the way
They could have done not so good work, because they realized people were just shredding it. 
 just 
So maybe the first sheet you'd do good work, but then you see nobody is really testing it, so you would do more and more and more. 
you see
And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble. 
okay
And we had two types of people: We had the people who built it, and the people who did not build it, and just looked at it as external observers. 
 just 
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami --  and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally. 
 just 
Or "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?" 
well
They thought everybody else would love it more as well. 
well
For some people, we just eliminated that. 
 just 
Well in an objective way, the origami now was uglier, it was more difficult. 
well
They were just like your kids, and you played with them for a few hours, and when you were about to leave, the parents said, "Hey, by the way, just before you leave, if you're interested, they're for sale." 
 just 
And this is because our kids are so valuable, not just because of who they are, but because of us, because they are so connected to us, and because of the time and connection. 
 just 
By the way, if you think IKEA instructions are not good, what about the instructions that come with kids, those are really tough. 
by the way
 By the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on. 
by the way
In infrastructure, let's just take one example. 
 just 
I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans. 
 just 
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves. 
i mean
And it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future. 
 just 
So I know you're probably thinking, okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment? 
okay
I mean, nine years is a long time. 
i mean
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school, that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud." 
 just 
when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know. 
you know
You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know. 
you know
And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power -- the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. 
 ah 
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have. 
 just 
And I thought, well this is going to be child's play. 
well
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy," tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of -- I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess, clues responded to -- versus the accuracy of those answers. 
i guess
But then you see the line start to go up. 
you see
And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling, having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up, and holding up "Go Watson" signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right. 
 just 
if we're going to be able to start outsourcing, not just lower unimportant brain functions. 
 just 
We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. 
 just 
There's just too much. 
 just 
According to a National Geographic survey I just saw, somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map. 
 just 
At some point you're just going to be like, "You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it." 
you know
And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here." 
 just 
And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month, he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there, that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach." 
you see
Or your alma mater or your job, and I know just a little something about it, enough to get the ball rolling. People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. 
 just 
And it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on. 
well
That doesn't work. That's just annoying. 
 just 
In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think, things don't always end well. 
well
We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn, who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over, I don't have to learn anymore," or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime. 
well
That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from. 
you see
For the most part, they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything, thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. 
 just 
So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home? 
 just 
Okay. And actually of those hands, if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home? 
okay
That's okay. 
okay
And if I get too close to him, he gets scared just like any other creature. 
 just 
And if I want to control him, I can just drive. 
 just 
Okay. Awesome. 
okay
But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future. 
 just 
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, which is what you see Romo doing on the left. 
you see
To be honest, I have no idea. 
to be honest
So I'll be talking about the success of my campus, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, in educating students of all types, across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. 
 um
And so I was always asking this question: "Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?" 
well
Well amazingly, the most important for me was this: That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education. 
well
And so it is especially significant that the university I now lead, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963. 
 um
 You see, most people don't realize that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering. 
well
Well a part of it, of course, is K-12. 
well
Whether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's and large numbers of A.P. credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors. 
you know
And the number one reason, we find, quite frankly, is they did not do well in first year science courses. 
well
That young man went on to graduate from UMBC, to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. 
 um
As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself, it's another thing to help someone else do well. 
well
I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying, "I've got this young man in class, a young black guy, and he seems like he's just not excited about the work. 
 just 
Do you know that? 
you know
Many students, K-12 and in universities, don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk. 
 just 
It means that now, not just in science and engineering, we now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences, in teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T. 
 just 
If you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000. 
 just 
I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries, where students are not there just to survive, where they love learning, where they enjoy being the best, where they will one day change the world. 
 just 
Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis, it just sucked me in immediately, as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me, until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room, who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases, 
 just 
It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. 
 just 
And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions. 
 just 
So let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay? 
 just 
And actually, can you see Libby? 
you see
Eric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful. 
 just 
So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get? 
 just 
TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here, give me a lay of the land. 
well
ED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside, a little bit toward the middle for me. 
okay
Okay, that's good. How about up a little bit? 
okay
Okay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me. 
okay
ED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in. 
well
And you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. 
 just 
That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real-time image processing, and the device will say, "Up, down, left, right, ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor." 
 just 
We just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses, Allison, who helped manage the transplant list, and a dozen other people who aren't pictured, a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist, even a financial counselor, Lisa, who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles. 
 just 
I should have been happy, because I was so well that I could go back to my normal doctors, but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. 
well
We're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers, as well as have an exchange network online, where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom, if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals, and we exchange all of that online. 
well
Now the second example of customization -- and by the way, you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals, so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals. 
you know
The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours, and make this kind of tool available, not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world, but in the mainstream -- every patient, every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. 
 just 
 So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. 
 just 
The surgery was done laparoscopically, so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen, and I had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything I'd done before without any changes. 
 just 
ED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again. 
well
 This TED stage and all of the TED stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies, and I've done that here today, and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers, I mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming. 
i mean
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience. 
well
I mean, how could the word scientist not have existed until 1833? 
i mean
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in 1812: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell. 
well
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics, this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too. 
well
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method, as well as that used by his peers. 
well
Whewell's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge to all ship captains. 
well
Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa, and, as he complained to Whewell, he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble. 
well
Members were encouraged to bring their wives, daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association, and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one, they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well. 
well
These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research, but they also encouraged thinking outside the box, rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question. 
 just 
There's a flip side as well. 
well
How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands. 
well
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet, reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water. 
 just 
We've all done that, but they do it every day, and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating, it just gets too much. 
 just 
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well. 
well
And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit, but it's also good economic sense, because they're saving a million dollars a year. 
 just 
It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives. 
 just 
That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample, a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate. 
okay
 And in case you think that poster's just propaganda, here's Priyanka, 23 years old. 
 just 
And if you know anything about rural India, you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do. 
you know
But not just that. 
 just 
And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong. 
 just 
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing, and that's to go out, protest, speak about the unspeakable, and talk shit. 
 just 
AIDS, incredibly, has just been named, in the past month, a chronic disease, meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years, as we said only a decade ago, but is thought to live decades, probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether. 
 just 
These are just remarkable, remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers. 
 just 
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is. 
 just 
But it's not just the mortality from these disorders. 
 just 
I mean, cancer seems far more serious. 
i mean
Well, there are probably three reasons. 
well
And maybe at this point, when you know what I do, or maybe what I've failed to do, you'll think that I probably ought to be fired, and I could certainly understand that. 
you know
It depends, of course, on what scale or what scope you want to think about, but this is an organ of surreal complexity, and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it, whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing 
 just 
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. 
well
Why does this matter? Well first because, for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change. 
well
There are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change. 
you see
I didn't have an exact address, but I knew his name, Abed, I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara, and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city, he broke my neck. 
 just 
Reading his words, I welled with anger. 
well
You know, it was most often when speaking to people that I wondered where I ended and my disability began, for many people told me what they told no one else. 
you know
I listened to her words. I suppose they were true. 
i suppose
I was me, but I was now me despite a limp, and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me. 
i suppose
He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said. 
 just 
"Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40." 
well
I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability, it would be okay, for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp. 
okay
You know death, and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life. 
you know
I just wanted you to know that. 
 just 
Not much has changed, by the way.  But they thought that, if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease, it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit. 
by the way
And when things work well, then the nervous system works well, and everything functions. 
well
But once in a while, things don't go so well, and there's trouble in these circuits, and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive and they're not quite working as they should. 
well
You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain. 
you see
I tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now. 
 just 
 Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger? 
okay
It's on. Just turned it on. 
 just 
And we decided to take on depression, and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent, and as you know, there are many treatments for depression, with medication and psychotherapy, even electroconvulsive therapy, but there are millions of people, and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression that do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help. 
you know
And we placed electrodes in area 25, and in the top scan you see before the operation, area 25, the sadness area is red hot, and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue, and then, after three months of continuous stimulation, 24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation, we have a complete reversal of this. 
you see
As you know, this is the main symptom of early onset Alzheimer's disease. 
you know
The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true, and it's easy to think that it is true, but in order to see it in another way, in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing, not just energetic, but a miraculous thing, a kind of emergent complexity that we're seeing happening right now, we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is, 
 just 
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
When you write, because it's a conscious process, because you can look backwards, you can do things with language that are much less likely if you're just talking. 
 just 
So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go, "Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech. 
you see
Well, if you can speak like writing, then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak. 
well
The problem was just that in the material, mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it. 
 just 
So Julie says, "I just sent you an email." 
 just 
You don't just zip right into it. 
 just 
So we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing, and yet it's easy to think, well, something is still wrong. 
well
Well, the fact of the matter is, look at this person in 1956, and this is when texting doesn't exist, "I Love Lucy" is still on the air. 
well
"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table, cannot write grammatically -- " We've heard that sort of thing before, not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher. 
 just 
"Bad spelling, incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing." 
well
And he's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies. 
well
There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face. 
 just 
The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth, zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year. 
 just 
You'll notice that, for the first four centuries, there's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent. 
 just 
But you know what the actual facts are? 
you know
You know what the growth in per-person income has been in the United States in the last six years? 
you know
I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted, but I decided I would end it at 0.2, just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries. 
 just 
But if growth slows down, instead of doubling our standard of living every generation, Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents, or even a quarter [more well off than] their parents. 
well
Well, it's a matter of arithmetic. 
well
Well, we're not going to do that, and the reason is the headwinds. 
well
And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900, only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years. 
 just 
And I'll just give you a few examples. 
 just 
You see, the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors, but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity's flexibility. 
you see
We shape our destiny, and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories, we're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system. 
 just 
We're not doing as well at that job as we should be. 
well
You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s, but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution, when factories were learning how to electrify their operations. 
well
And that's just the United States. 
 just 
If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress, because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. 
 just 
You know, I bet you are too. 
you know
I used to teach my students that there are some things, you know, computers just aren't good at, like driving a car through traffic. 
you know
 That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down Route 101 in, yes, a driverless car. 
 just 
Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks, an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users. 
 just 
You know, robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation. 
you know
Damn.  But you know, Watson is growing up fast. 
you know
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling, but like too many others, they misunderstand its basic causes. 
you know
You know, I recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics. 
you know
Today, millions of Americans do have faster, cheaper, more accurate tax preparation, and the founders of Intuit have done very well for themselves. 
well
That is a microcosm of what's happening, not just in software and services, but in media and music, in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade -- in short, in every industry. 
 just 
When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method to better protect myself and to detect the enemy, as he did.  After finishing this series of protests, I started questioning why my fate was like this, and I realized that it's not just me -- all Chinese are as confused as I am. 
 just 
We can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible. 
 just 
This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. 
you see
So we thought, you know what? 
you know
You see, plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. 
you see
Everything went well from there, and we became amazing scientists.  MW: Um... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking. 
 um
MW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault. 
well
You see, I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture, and as a result, we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. 
you see
I know some of you in the crowd are thinking, well, carbon dioxide is horrible, it's a greenhouse gas. 
well
I'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down, I'll slow down too." 
okay
It was just going 65 -- to zero? 
 just 
Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes. 
okay
Okay, so that's all you have, eyes that weren't really designed for this task, but then people ask you to do things like, you want to make a lane change, what's the first thing they ask you do? 
okay
In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other, we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind, to the right and left, all at the same time, bird's eye view, we will actually be able to see into those cars. 
 just 
 Right? I mean, somebody's seen him. 
i mean
You'll know, because your car will know, because that other car will have whispered something in his ear, like, "By the way, five minutes, motorcyclist, watch out." 
by the way
I mean, they're Newtonian objects. 
i mean
We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars, just sharing GPS. 
 just 
Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic, when cars just share GPS data, and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots: stereo cameras, GPS, and the two-dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems. 
 just 
So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how. 
you know
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way. 
you know
Well, it depends on two things: one, the ability of the car, and second the ability of the driver. 
well
If one guy has a really great car, but they're on their phone or, you know, doing something, they're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency. 
you know
But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy, just like right now, when I look at your car from the outside, I don't really know about you. 
 just 
They just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest. 
 just 
Also on the web, when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses, I assume you know that you can hit the Tab key to jump from box to box to box. 
you know
While we're talking about text -- When you want to highlight -- this is just an example --  When you want to highlight a word, please don't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie. 
 just 
Double click the word. Watch "200" -- I go double-click, it neatly selects just that word. 
 just 
You can just type over it. This is in every program. 
 just 
I've just turned your $50 camera into a $1,000 camera with that trick. 
 just 
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it, and because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. 
okay
And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. 
 just 
Well, I have a big announcement to make today, and I'm really excited about this. 
well
to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. 
well
But this is actually a talk about, okay --  — but this is actually a talk about fission. 
okay
And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it? 
you know
So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. 
you see
You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, and that was great, and we don't need them anymore, and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially? 
you know
Well, we're securing them, and it would be great if we could burn them, eat them up, and this reactor loves this stuff. 
well
So going back to what I was saying before about all power being produced -- well, other than photovoltaic -- being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine, that's actually not that efficient, and in fact, in a nuclear power plant like this, it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient. 
well
They operate anywhere from, you know, maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius. 
you know
Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic, and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it. 
well
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant, you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub-critical setting, basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers. 
 just 
So even in the event of an accident, yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know, sorry for the power company, but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land. 
you know
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point, but before that I was obsessed with space, and I was really excited about, you know, being an astronaut and designing rockets, which was something that was always exciting to me. 
well
I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts. 
i mean
And people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing, and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?" 
well
And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with, which is weird for a scientist. 
 just 
  She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey." 
 just 
And I said to her, "Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear." 
well
He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood. 
 just 
You were so excited, we just let you go." 
 just 
You just have to strut." 
 just 
And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life. 
you know
And I want you to just see what I've become." 
 just 
And you know your toughest kids are never absent. 
you know
Is this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha. 
 oh 
I want to start to show just a few pictures to you, and after I'll speak. 
 just 
I lived totally inside photography doing long term projects, and I want to show you just a few pictures of -- again, you'll see inside the social projects, that I went to, I published many books on these photographs, but I'll just show you a few ones now. 
 just 
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds, and we didn't know how to deal with these. 
 just 
And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us. 
 just 
We tried to do a new presentation of the planet, and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project, please. 
 just 
Well, this —  — Thank you. Thank you very much. 
well
When you have rain in a place that has no trees, in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream, brings soil, destroying our water source, destroying the rivers, and no humidity to retain. 
 just 
I want to show you now, to finish, just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction. 
 just 
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture. 
you see
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that, it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things, because it's not just the electronic tattoos, it's facial recognition that's getting really good. 
 just 
[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...] There are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook — they take your picture, they tie it to the social media, they figure out you really like to wear black dresses, so maybe the person in the store comes up and says, "Hey, we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you." 
 just 
What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes?  Well, then, because of electronic tattoos, maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality, because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will. 
well
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. 
well
Once you get that electronic tattoo, you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time, so as you go through this stuff, just be careful what you post. 
 just 
So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever. 
 just 
Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples, and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple. 
well
 But as you're thinking about Narcissus, just don't fall in love with your own reflection. 
 just 
So more than just explosions, chemistry is everywhere. 
 just 
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over? 
 just 
Recently, I showed this to my students, and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. 
 just 
You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers, and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education. 
you know
For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time, but if it is the focus of our students' experience, it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing. 
 just 
Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock -- absolutely freaked out, okay? 
okay
And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip, okay, trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206. 
 just 
The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on. 
 just 
You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids, and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms -- to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom. 
you see
But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry, we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day, and spark their imagination. 
 just 
You know, I grew up in the inner city, and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school, and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later. 
you know
And you know something about a lousy school? 
you know
That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year, it's still the same approach, right? 
i mean
One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't, tough luck. Just tough luck. 
 just 
You know why? Because they didn't care. 
you know
I said one day, well, look, if the science says -- this is science, not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there. 
well
You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules? 
you know
Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have, schools were open all year. They were open all year, because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. 
well
None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right? 
okay
You know, we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about, you know, because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff, but we do health services, and I have to raise a lot of money. 
you know
I'd say, "Well, you know a child who has cavities is not going to, uh, be able to study as well." 
well
But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them? 
you know
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts? 
you know
I mean, you're educators. You work, you say, you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it. 
i mean
You know when we're going to get the results back? 
you know
So how much money did we just spend on all of that? 
 just 
And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do from last year to this year?" 
okay
So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about. 
 just 
You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work." 
you know
I mean, I really believe they should be closed. 
i mean
Every time something didn't work, we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right? 
 just 
You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot. 
you know
And this is something, by the way, that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field. 
by the way
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John, 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. 
well
So that's just how this goes.  JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school? 
 just 
GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids, the same kids, these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school, they drop out in record numbers. 
well
So sometimes they don't have it inside, and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this, but I know my mother's going to be mad." 
you know
JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada. 
well
Everyone knew who I was, so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected, and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail, I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent. 
 just 
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school, and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. 
 just 
It just takes a little bit more. 
 just 
Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable. 
well
You just had to do things sometimes. 
 just 
So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended, and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me. 
 just 
And it was out of fear -- fear of, well, what if they get it wrong? 
well
Well, we're making school worth coming to every day. 
well
They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood, a school that they can be proud to say they attend, and a school that the community can be proud of as well, and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances. 
well
All I mean is, is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents. 
i mean
When legislators and others think about economic development, what they first of all think about are business tax incentives, property tax abatements, job creation tax credits, you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place. 
you know
Okay. If you look at the research evidence -- that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment, wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults, you take those known effects, you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out, and you take research on how much skills drive job creation, you will conclude, 
okay
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically because they're low-cost. 
well
Well, let's think about it this way. 
well
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus, Ohio, but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will, for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and become Wolverines. 
you know
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data, Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume. 
well
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way, pay off in higher adult skills. 
okay
Well, one obvious barrier is cost. 
well
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person, is something that any state government can afford to do. 
okay
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it. 
 just 
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something, what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid, that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career, just doing the preschool, not improving K-12 or anything else after that, not doing anything with college tuition or access, just directly improving preschool, and we would get five percent higher earnings 
 just 
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately not an economic question, it's a moral question: Are we willing, as Americans, are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids, but our community? 
i mean
 But it's not true Americans don't get irony, but I just want you to know that that's what people are saying about you behind your back. 
 just 
You know, so when you leave living rooms in Europe, people say, thankfully, nobody was ironic in your presence. 
you know
But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg. 
 just 
Okay. Or grandchildren. 
okay
I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this. 
 just 
If you sit kids down, hour after hour, doing low-grade clerical work, don't be surprised if they start to fidget, you know? 
you know
Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents, not just a small range of them. 
 just 
And by the way, the arts aren't just important because they improve math scores. 
 just 
You know, you're not there just to pass on received information. 
you know
You see, in the end, education is about learning. 
you see
I mean, other animals may well have imaginations and creativity, but it's not so much in evidence, is it, as ours? 
well
I mean, you may have a dog. 
i mean
You know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it? 
you know
Now, we only know that's what they do well at, because that's all that's being tested. 
well
They don't look for other things that matter just as much. 
 just 
I mean, there's a bit, but it's not what gets people up in the morning, what keeps them at their desks. 
i mean
And they all looked a bit bemused, and said, "Well, we don't have one. 
well
Now people always say, "Well, you know, you can't compare Finland to America." 
well
I mean, I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there.  Really. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left. 
i mean
 But what all the high-performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident, sadly, across the systems in America -- I mean, as a whole. 
i mean
It's an investment, and every other country that's succeeding well knows that, whether it's Australia, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong or Shanghai. 
well
You see, there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education -- That's what happens in some systems. 
you see
It's like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data, and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough, if we just get it right, it will all hum along perfectly into the future. 
well
They have strong support for the teachers, close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum, and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school. 
well
You know? 
you know
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. 
 just 
Let's start by asking who's doing well. 
well
Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. 
well
Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. 
well
First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. 
well
To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay? 
okay
Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. 
i mean
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. 
okay
You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. 
you see
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. 
 just 
At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. 
 just 
All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? 
okay
I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. 
 just 
We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. 
well
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. 
 just 
It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. 
 just 
Stick with the people you know. 
you know
So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness, and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today, but also by organizations, organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities. 
 just 
In the context of this broad range of digital relations, safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation. 
well
It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver, because that was, like, I loved it, and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden." 
 just 
And --   And it worked really well there. 
well
And you know, it had a profound effect on me. 
you know
It sounds silly, but I thought, okay, the way the world works can be changed, and it can be changed by me in these small ways. 
okay
And my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this, well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit. 
well
And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers. 
 just 
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp, where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything. 
 just 
So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together, you know, make something, I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you. 
you know
I'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like, "Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon. 
okay
And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this." 
 just 
Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works, pushing what matter can do, the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium, and any sufficiently complicated task, whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child -- anything that's complicated -- comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it, and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say, 
 just 
"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this. 
well
And so you can kind of hack a pencil, just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. 
 just 
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly. 
 just 
And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump, were inviting me to give workshops, just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together. 
 just 
And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics, but let's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over. 
 just 
And so I just want to do a quick demo. 
 just 
So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit, and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you. 
 just 
So I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB. 
 just 
And I'll just hook up the forward arrow. 
 just 
And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it. 
 just 
And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up, now I have a left arrow and a right arrow, so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards. Awesome. 
 just 
You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh and just Google for game controllers. 
 just 
And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up.  And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target? 
you know
Well, if you take those out, they hold water great, but you can totally cut your toes, so yeah, just be careful. 
well
You know the Happiness Project, where the experts are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is? 
you know
Well, I think it's cool, but we should be doing that stuff ourselves. 
well
Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS. 
 just 
And then all these professional musicians started using it, like at Coachella, just this weekend Jurassic 5 was using this onstage, and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here, and he put this up last month. 
 just 
And as you start to mess around this way, I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with, and a little bit more like you could participate And so next time you're on an escalator and you drop an M&amp;M by accident, you know, maybe that's an M&amp;M surfboard, not an escalator, 
you know
We all think a lot about how to live well. 
well
I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well. 
well
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there. 
 just 
Jim and Shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that. 
okay
A lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me." 
 just 
We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by Marsha, who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can't get out there, and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands. 
 just 
When you believe it's okay to let go, you will. 
okay
Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch. 
 just 
Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died, celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see. 
 just 
And here's Shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the Modini ranch. 
 just 
Okay, it's great to be back at TED. 
okay
Why don't I just start by firing away with the video? 
 just 
  Man: Okay, Glass, record a video. 
okay
Man 2: Okay Glass, hang out with The Flying Club. 
okay
Man 4: You ready? You ready?  Woman 2: Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture. 
okay
Woman 3: Okay, Glass, record a video! 
okay
Man 8: Okay, A12, right there! 
okay
 Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince. 
 just 
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well. 
well
Though in all seriousness, this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass. 
 just 
Should it be by just walking around looking down? 
 just 
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it. 
okay
You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. 
 just 
You're just kind of moving around. 
 just 
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works. 
 just 
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it. 
 just 
This project has lasted now, been just over two years. 
 just 
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment. 
 just 
I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler. 
 just 
You know, I'd be like -- But in this case, you know, I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to. 
you know
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away, be it email or social posts or whatnot, even though it wasn't really -- there's nothing really that important or that pressing. 
 just 
I wonder how many of you, looking at that, said to yourselves just now, "I would not have done that. 
 just 
You can think what your own habit is, whether it's a new car, a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink. 
 just 
You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization, the Against Malaria Foundation, which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one, and we know reliably that if we provide nets, they're used, and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria, just one of the many preventable diseases 
 just 
But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed, and not only that, but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people, wherever they are, are like us, that they can suffer as we can, that parents grieve for the deaths of their children, as we do, and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us, 
well
it matters just as much to all of these people. 
 just 
So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want. 
 just 
And that might seem surprising, because a lot of people think, "Philosophy is remote from the real world; economics, we're told, just makes us more selfish, and we know that math is for nerds." 
 just 
Well, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire, you can have that kind of impact. 
well
Now, mentioning time might lead you to think, "Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these 19,000 lives that are lost every day?" 
well
Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote, "The Life You Can Save," which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we're going to live an ethical life, it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat, steal, maim, kill, but that if we have enough, we have to share some of that 
 just 
Well, right, it is a good thing to do, but you have to think what else you could do with the resources. 
well
GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities, not just whether they're well-run, and it's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three, of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one. 
well
So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations, thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list, but you can find effective organizations, and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor. 
 just 
I'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that I received while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago. 
 just 
Well, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that, because I still have two kidneys. 
well
So if you're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well, there's a way for you to get off the hook. 
well
The shake developed out of, really, a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots. 
 just 
But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. 
 just 
And he actually took one look at my squiggly line, and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?" 
well
So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. 
 just 
I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. 
 just 
And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. 
 just 
At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in -- well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks — but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one, so I decided to ask for 50. 
well
Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents. 
 just 
Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops?  So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. 
 just 
Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. 
 just 
In 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years, and go out and get a job, and this happened. 
 just 
Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy, though I think it probably is, it's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually. 
 just 
But what if, actually, it's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit? 
 just 
And even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well. 
well
 And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what's cheap and what's available. 
 just 
We shared the whole of WikiHouse under a Creative Commons license, and now what's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing. 
 just 
I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map. 
you see
You know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team. 
you know
How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on, but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning, off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation -- low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions that anyone can very, very easily make, and to put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone? 
 just 
When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music. 
 just 
The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. 
 just 
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few. 
 just 
And they were remarkably well preserved, morphologically just phenomenal. 
well
But I'm actually standing here today, amazingly, to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality, but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach, maybe not from the insects in amber -- in fact, this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" — but from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost. 
well
So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well. 
well
Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion, and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth. 
well
With advances in ancient DNA technology, we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned, and I just wanted to talk about two of them, the woolly and the Columbian mammoth, both of which were living very close to each other so when the glaciers were massive in North America, the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones, and came into contact with the relatives living to the south, 
 just 
Now, when I bring up this with my friends, we often talk about, well, where would you put it? 
well
Well, that's not actually the case. 
well
I think it's just that we have to think very deeply about the implications, ramifications of our actions, and so as long as we have good, deep discussion like we're having now, I think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it. 
 just 
But I just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we're doing it first. 
 just 
That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design, and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture, is still posters, is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today. 
you see
And in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art for a few years, starting not very timidly but just pointedly with works, for instance, by Martin Wattenberg -- the way a machine plays chess with itself, that you see here, or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface for One Laptop Per Child, Toshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments, 
you see
Timidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations, but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good.  But here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic. 
okay
I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know? 
you know
You know, it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art, or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to, would like to be called, artists. 
you know
And you know what? 
you know
  You know, we have to go through that. 
you know
And you know, the amount of work -- yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris, and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed. 
you know
So many people helped us — designers of games, you might know Jamin Warren and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine, and you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it. 
you know
We live today, as you know very well, not in the digital, not in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two. 
well
I mean, that interface is beautiful. 
i mean
You know, with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are. 
you know
You know, video games can be truly deep even when they're completely mindless. 
you know
I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy. 
you know
Or, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States. 
you know
And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival in Reykjavík that was quite amazing. 
 just 
I mean, we're talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many, but that is very educational. 
i mean
And you know, Valve -- you know, Portal -- is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss when we acquired the video games, what to do with violence. 
you know
At MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection, but when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian, I said, "You know what, we need a Beretta." 
you know
Interestingly, I learned that it's considered that in design and in the design collection, what you see is what you get. 
you see
So when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection. 
you see
But here, in this particular case, we decided, you know, with Kate and Paul, that we would have no gratuitous violence. 
you know
And right now, we started with the first 14, but we have several that are coming up, and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet is because you don't acquire just the game. 
 just 
In absence of the code, because, you know, video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases, in absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company. 
you know
So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness, which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. 
you see
You know, I feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind them, and if they're not architects, bona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling. 
you know
They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen. 
 just 
If anything, we want to show the code, and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man, of the Pac-Man code. 
you see
So the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox. You see them here displayed alongside other examples of design, furniture and other parts, but there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia, only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. 
you see
And what I say to people, it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall, and just we're showing the shadow. 
 just 
Along the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know? 
you know
This is also true, by the way, of the word "gender," because a lot of people hear the word "gender" and they think it means "women." 
by the way
We've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary, and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence, well, close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain. 
well
And I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women, okay? It's a legitimate thing to ask. 
okay
You know, the perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness. 
you know
And you know what all this is about? 
you know
It's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys, it's a statement to them to sit down and shut up, keep the current system in place, because we don't like it when people rock the boat. 
well
And by the way, one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow, like I said, that they're anti-male. 
by the way
You know what? The same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men. 
you know
And when I say abusive, I don't mean just men who are beating women. 
 just 
We're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack. 
 just 
You know, that could be my sister you're talking about, and could you joke about something else? 
you know
Well, the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable, not just because it's illegal, but because it's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture. 
well
And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status, young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women, as well as towards other boys and men, will lose status as a result of it, guess what? 
well
Now, it's easier said than done, because I'm saying it now, but I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other, which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men's issues, but they're also leadership issues for men. 
 just 
We need leadership training, because, for example, when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team -- and I work extensively in that realm as well -- makes a sexist comment, makes a homophobic statement, makes a racist comment, there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio. 
well
And some people will say, "Well, he needs sensitivity training." 
well
And other people will say, "Well get off it. 
well
You know, that's political correctness run amok, and he made a stupid statement. Move on." 
you know
You know, for example, I work a lot in college and university athletics throughout North America. 
you know
But you know what's missing? The leadership. 
you know
By the way, we owe it to women. 
by the way
We that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well. 
well
One quarter of the homes received a message that said, did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer? 
you know
And wouldn't you know it, they did. 
you know
Well, if something is inconvenient, even if we believe in it, moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us -- but social pressure, that's powerful stuff. 
well
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills, and we're just getting started. 
 just 
We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior. 
 just 
But we're just one company, and this is just scratching the surface. 
 just 
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms, and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home. 
i mean
That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change. 
well
Well, in most places, utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison. 
well
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility. 
you see
I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college. 
 just 
Whilst this was going on, the police I had alerted, they were on standby, and just as the concoction was ready, and they were about to give it to the kids, I phoned the police, and fortunately they came and busted them. 
 just 
You see a hand counting money just in front of me. 
you see
The next moment, you see the money in my hands, counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody. 
you see
But you see, when you have the hard core evidence, you are able to affect society. 
you see
There were issues of bad food being served as I recall that some of the food I ate is just not good for a human being. 
 just 
I mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend -- and that's what I call proper, when four of us are on a manhole. 
i mean
You see, we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions. 
you see
How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah? 
 just 
AAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about setting the priorities right, so we got people to take me to court. 
you know
CA: Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that, because you're regularly putting your life at risk. 
 just 
AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort. 
you see
So yes, when the backup systems are put in place, I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes, but it's a hazard of a profession. 
okay
I mean, everybody has their hazard. 
i mean
CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work and you've taught us a story like no story I think any of us have heard before. 
well
Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with in the wild for the last 28 years. 
well
Well, we know a few things. 
well
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky, so it's very hard to observe animals underwater, but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida. 
 just 
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy. 
you see
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks. 
well
For example, males will stimulate a female You know, I've been buzzed in the water. 
you know
 And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting. 
well
 You see, they're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad. 
well
So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin. 
 just 
She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt, and he's just learning how to play this game. 
 just 
And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time, their favorite toys? 
well
The diver here has a rope toy, and I'm on the keyboard on the left, and I've just played the rope key, and that's the request for the toy from the human. 
 just 
Okay, so here's a second toy in the water. 
okay
Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us. 
well
In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that, well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now, but they live in quite a different environment, and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems. 
well
I mean, imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet. 
i mean
Now, for about 200 years, people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you -- the age of technological unemployment is at hand — starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain just about two centuries ago, and they have been wrong. 
 just 
The reason it's different is that, just in the past few years, our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never, ever had before: understanding, speaking, hearing, seeing, answering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills. 
 just 
For example, mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive, but the research arm of the Defense Department just launched a competition to have them do things like this, and if the track record is any guide, this competition is going to be successful. 
 just 
The first is, technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we're on where output goes up over time, while at the same time, prices go down, and volume and quality just continue to explode. 
 just 
In a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document, we have amazing new possibilities. 
 just 
This is just a plain statement of the facts. 
 just 
We have had one of those in America for just about the entire postwar period. 
 just 
We all know a lot of the statistics, but just to repeat one of them, median income in America has actually gone down over the past 15 years, and we're in danger of getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time. 
 just 
But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented, as we started to automate the economy, and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses, as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy, the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot. 
 just 
The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two, so the classic Econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine: Encourage entrepreneurship, double down on infrastructure, and make sure we're turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills. 
 just 
To give just one example, there are about five million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. 
 just 
Well, it's two things. First, it's time. 
well
And I just love this guy. 
 just 
I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042, and he's really hard to get, and I wanted him to be in the movie, to reprise his role in the movie. 
i mean
But the thing is, had I waited for him until 2042, my film wouldn't be a futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right? 
 just 
The instrument always ends up resembling its model.]  Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt, constraints can boost creativity, because I desperately needed these objects in my movie. 
you see
And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea. 
you know
But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible, the guy is too busy and he will say no. 
you know
Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style, I might as well call the real guy and ask him, and I sent him my books, and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium. 
well
But then, you know, eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality. 
you know
If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity, you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity. 
 just 
So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home, hey, it's just batter up. 
 just 
That's just not the way it happens. 
 just 
You just take your position and play the game. 
 just 
Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza. 
well
"Well, maybe we can go half and half." 
well
Okay, so when you're playing baseball, so if we talk about during sexual activity, when you're playing baseball, you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time. 
 just 
Okay, but what about pizza? 
okay
Well, in baseball, you play to win. 
well
Well, in pizza, we're not really -- there's no winning. How do you win pizza? 
well
If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross. 
 just 
Well, Arthur C. Clarke, a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s, said that, "We overestimate technology in the short term, and we underestimate it in the long term." 
well
So you know how it ended up, Spencer Tracy brought a computer, a mainframe computer of 1957, in to help the librarians. 
you know
Well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn't much use for that job. 
well
And we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask. 
 just 
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients. 
 just 
By the way, what's going on with the eyes? 
by the way
It just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search. 
 just 
They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes. 
 just 
I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older. 
i mean
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that? 
you see
 I'm just kidding. 
 just 
As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet. 
 just 
So, how did it just do that? 
 just 
Here, you see that it's stable, and even if I give it little nudges, it goes back -- to the nice, balanced position. 
you see
 Okay, you should be asking yourself, why doesn't the water fall out of the glass? 
okay
In this instance, this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage, just like human athletes do, instead of building machines with redundancy. 
 just 
Okay, here goes. 
okay
Let's make the right choice, the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines, just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us. 
 just 
Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process. 
well
Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks, it was a revelation, a discovery, that we had the potential, together, to be masters of our own fate, to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine, and then to design a better life. 
well
Well, I first began to understand this when I was 14 years old. 
well
You see, then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country, and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where, maybe, the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country. 
you see
 So in 1967, elections were coming, things were going well in the campaign, the house was electric. 
well
Well, we survived, but democracy did not. 
well
I had just been elected prime minister, but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not 6 percent, as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government, but actually 15.6 percent. 
 just 
Greece, you see, was only a preview of what is in store for us all. 
you see
Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself. 
well
But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece. 
 just 
If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential, well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece, and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion. 
well
And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots. 
well
You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens, that term originated there. 
you see
You see, markets and politics then were one, unified, accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people. 
you see
Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in. 
well
Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist. 
well
The revival of democratic politics will come from you, and I mean all of you. 
i mean
Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas, whether it's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally, where everybody lives, everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality, everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy, dogma rather than critical thinking, technocracy rather than democracy, everyone who stands up to the unchecked power, whether it's authoritarian leaders, plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens, 
 just 
George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted, and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem. 
well
BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries. 
you see
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game. 
well
Now, lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms -- flying, driving, or just lying in wait. 
 just 
It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations, but criminal organizations, private enterprise, even powerful individuals. 
 just 
You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights. 
you know
You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars. 
you see
They were just influenced by the adults around them. 
 just 
It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women. 
 just 
I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign. 
 just 
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite. 
okay
There were people like that, I just showed some examples, who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia, and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views. 
 just 
Remember, black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white, so it has captured the idea of unpredictability, unknowability, that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable. 
you see
Let me just focus on one of them: the super-exponential growth with positive feedback. 
 just 
It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else. 
 just 
Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noise that you hear a structure emit, sing to you when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on, there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback, the more damage gives the more damage, so you can actually predict, within, of course, a probability band, when the rupture will occur. 
you know
This has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don't attack the core, the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking. 
well
Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years we have come out of our ivory tower, and started to publish ex ante -- and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" — before the crash confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses. 
well
Let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles. 
 just 
This is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble, a factor of three, 300 percent in just a few years. 
 just 
You know, they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now. 
you know
And all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes. 
 just 
17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago, we identified that the U.S. stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the 21st of May that there will be a change of regime. 
 just 
This is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making. 
 just 
This diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades. 
 just 
Very recently, with collaborators, we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon-king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed, when control is on, these dragons. 
you see
What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars -- use the words, " ... it all just sounds so, so simple." 
 just 
And the highest priority, you see on the screen, is washing people once a day, particularly children. 
you see
of the 25 houses you see on the screen. 
you see
If you get a red cross, well, I've looked carefully around the room and it's not going to make much difference to this crew. 
well
That means that by the age of five, you can't see as well for the rest of your life. 
well
You can't hear as well for the rest of your life. 
well
You can't breathe as well. 
well
What you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those not-so-famous houses lived in by 50,000 indigenous people -- 35 percent had a working shower. 
you see
Not well-designed, not beautiful, not elegant -- just that they function. 
well
Well, nine percent of what we spend is damage, misuse or abuse of any sort. 
well
It's a developing-world illness, and yet, the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s, where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes, doing damage. 
you see
Well, first thing we do, we get showers working. 
well
We put washing facilities in the school as well, so kids can wash their faces many times during the day. 
well
Well, we call up the doctor of flies -- and, yes, there is a doctor of flies. 
well
He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide. 
you see
We changed the environment, not just treated the eyes. 
 just 
 Just to show that the principles we've used in Australia can be used in other places, I'm just going to go to one other place, and that's Nepal. 
 just 
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets. 
well
And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili. 
i mean
The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this can be, let's just say very annoying. 
 just 
Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden the power goes out, your Internet connection goes down with it, so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem, how do I switch back? 
okay
The other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours of battery left, so you can continue working, you can continue being productive, and let's just say you are less stressed. 
 just 
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread, even though it usually didn't. 
i mean
I decided to go, just because they told me to, without trying much. 
 just 
He just looked back at me very warmly, but said no words. 
 just 
AH: You can do English, then Korean as well. 
well
 JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up. 
okay
I just wanted to say that I miss you, and I love you, and please come back to me and stay alive. 
 just 
 Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you, and if you can't find me, I will also look for you, and I hope to see you one day. 
 just 
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world. 
 just 
What happened, that is, on the night in the year 610 when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran on a mountain just outside Mecca? 
 just 
I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am, just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah. 
 just 
You're certain that you possess the Truth -- inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T -- and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness, by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride in being so very right, in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism. 
i mean
In the northwest corner of the United States, right up near the Canadian border, there's a little town called Libby, Montana, and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky. 
 just 
She thought he must just have been worn out by the work. 
 just 
But then a few years later, her mother died, and that seemed stranger still, because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever. 
 just 
They said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous, someone would have told us." 
well
And some people are blind because they think, well, seeing anything is just futile. 
well
And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say, "Well, you know, the people who do see, they're whistleblowers, and we all know what happens to them." 
well
And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is, "Well, there's no point, because you see what happens to them. 
well
And he said, "You know, I'm not the kind of guy to rat people out, but some things just cross the line. 
you know
And I asked him why he did it, and he said, "Well, it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it. 
well
She came up to me one night, and she just said, 'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'" Or I think of Cynthia Thomas, a really loyal army daughter and army wife, who, as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War, was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post-traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town 
 just 
And she said to me, she said, "You know, Margaret, I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up. 
you know
So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? 
 just 
You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes. 
you see
I mean, how hard can it be? 
i mean
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. 
 just 
You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out. 
you see
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. 
 just 
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier. 
 just 
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore. 
i guess
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. 
well
What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening, an underlying epidemic, the one we ought to be worried about? 
 just 
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. 
by the way
Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. 
by the way
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. 
 just 
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong? 
 just 
So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising. 
you see
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing. 
 just 
First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. 
 just 
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. 
you know
Now, you would think, well, look, most of you laughed at that. 
well
Paul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel." 
 just 
Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons. 
well
You know, it's my view basically about religion, that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who has the best imaginary friend. 
you know
 And this is my most well-known cartoon. 
well
Well, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide. 
well
Drawn just right, still not funny enough. 
 just 
Office worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No. 
okay
In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think it's both wrong and also okay at the same time. 
okay
And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay? 
okay
Within that context, we feel it's okay. 
okay
"I started my vegetarianism for health reasons, Then it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people." 
 just 
"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay? 
okay
Well, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own. 
well
Yeah, but this was not just any frog. 
 just 
Unlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well, this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs, swallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food, didn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus. 
well
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well. 
well
And just as everybody got excited about it, bang! 
 just 
And normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands, and the same thing happens in a cell. 
you know
Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope. 
well
Well, we had no real reason to expect it would, and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these. 
well
And just last February, the last time we did these trials, I saw a miracle starting to happen. 
 just 
Well, George Church, in his book, "Regenesis," has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA. 
well
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in 1926. 
 just 
This one was just as grand. 
 just 
In just 30 years, China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second-largest economy. 
 just 
Well, the assumptions are wrong. 
well
Now these are not moves from "Karate Kid," okay? 
okay
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay? 
okay
This is not a put-down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact. 
 just 
Well, apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department. 
well
Financial Times polls global youth attitudes, and these numbers, brand new, just came from last week. 
 just 
If they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others, and a little bit more on political reform at home, they might give their democracy a better chance. 
 just 
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist, called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism." 
you know
So I know the largest public opinion survey company in China, okay? 
okay
Do you know who their biggest client is? 
you know
Not just from the central government, the city government, the provincial government, to the most local neighborhood districts. 
 just 
But then you've just mentioned other elements like, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course, a lot of other data that go in a different direction: tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests, etc. 
you know
So you seem to suggest the Chinese model doesn't have a space outside of the Party for civil society to express itself. 
you see
And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here. 
you see
You know, a census of Indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish. 
you know
You can imagine that, for the entire country of Zambia, answering just that single question ... 
 just 
And what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning. 
 just 
You just had teams of hundreds of people. 
 just 
The process just stops. Happens all the time. 
 just 
I was working in the Centers for Disease Control and I had a lot more hair back then as well. 
well
Because if we can do that, if we can actually just collect the data electronically, digitally, from the very beginning, we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing, of having somebody type that stuff into the computer. 
 just 
It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted. 
well
What do you know? 
you know
The problem was, after a few years of doing that, I realized -- I had been to maybe six or seven programs -- and I thought, you know, if I keep this up at this pace, over my whole career, maybe I'm going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs. 
you know
The demand for this, the need for data to run better programs just within health -- not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries -- is enormous. 
 just 
So what do I mean by that? 
i mean
The point is that anything, any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings -- it just doesn't scale. 
 just 
And, you know, I was thinking, "How could I take myself out of the picture?" 
you know
You may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous, but for me it was miraculous, because I noticed, just as I was wrestling with this problem -- I was working in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly, at the time -- I noticed that every sub-Saharan African health worker that I was working with had a Hotmail account. 
 just 
While I was thinking about it, people started using even more things like this, just as we were. 
 just 
You just have to hear about it and go to the website. 
 just 
And the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail. 
 just 
But there are some additional benefits as well. 
well
Now we knew when we built this system, the whole point of it, just like with the PalmPilots, was that you'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set. 
 just 
That's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation. 
 just 
So I told you before that when we were doing it the old-fashioned way, I realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket -- 10, 20, 30 different programs. 
 just 
It's just that their beauty is missed because they're so omnipresent, so, I don't know, commonplace, that people don't notice them. 
 just 
Who here can't remember thinking, well, looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids? 
well
You know, when you were masters of daydreaming? 
you know
It's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze, and I think that's a pity. 
 just 
 They're like nature's version of those inkblot images, you know, that shrinks used to show their patients in the '60s, and I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds, you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills. 
you know
And you look up and what do you see? 
you see
You've just been dumped by your partner, and everywhere you look, it's kissing couples. 
 just 
You know, you're thinking about your own mortality. 
you know
 Or maybe you see a topless sunbather. 
you see
This looks like a series of breaking waves, and it's caused by shearing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly, and in the middle, in between, you get this undulating of the air, and if the difference in those speeds is just right, the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices. 
 just 
You just need to step outside, pay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday, so mundane that everybody else misses it. 
 just 
It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen, you know, when we're in a wi-fi zone. 
you know
You know, when you're not dealing with the traditional pressures of earning a living and putting food on the table, raising a family, writing thank you letters, you have to now contend with answering a mountain of unanswered emails, updating a Facebook page, feeding your Twitter feed. 
you know
We need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows that slowing down and being in the present, not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done, but just being here, letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present, it's good for you, and it's good for the way you feel. 
 just 
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world. 
you know
RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band. 
 just 
Okay, so most of you are. 
okay
But first, let’s just suppose that we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus. 
 just 
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. 
i mean
On the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture, with a 100 percent phosphorus dose. 
you see
And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India, the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases, there's no need to add any phosphorus at all, because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. 
well
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself a $30 million mansion in Malibu, California. 
well
But does it just happen over there? 
 just 
Well, at 22, I was very lucky. 
well
Well, some of that sprang from our work. 
well
So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed. 
 just 
Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who, well, they talked about a different problem: that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing. 
well
And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge. 
 just 
And in the years that I've been, and we've all been campaigning and investigating, I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global, massive scale possible, well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase "weak governance." 
well
I mean, yes, it's all of those, but corruption, it's made possible by the actions of global facilitators. 
i mean
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up with high-end art and luxury houses without help. 
well
A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him, one of which was used to buy the art, and American banks, well, they funneled 73 million dollars into the States, some of which was used to buy that California mansion. 
well
So the reality is, is that the engine of corruption, well, it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan. 
well
This engine, well, it's driven by our international banking system, by the problem of anonymous shell companies, and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil, gas and mining operations, and, most of all, by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff. 
well
Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent. 
 just 
Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years. 
well
So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite, and the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry, and you can see that on YouTube, but it proved what we had long suspected, because it showed how the state's chief minister, despite his later denials, used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family. 
well
And HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere. 
well
Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes. 
well
Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and Crown dependencies, and so it's not just an offshore problem, it's an on-shore one too. 
 just 
You see, shell companies, they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. 
you see
Okay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them. 
okay
Now, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went. 
 just 
I mean, these are state assets. 
i mean
And finally, well, there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable. 
well
It's just how some business is done. 
 just 
So in effect, what? We just accept it. 
 just 
In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent, well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea. 
well
My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world, sometimes just a small block of wood, if you stack it up tall, actually is an incredibly inspiring thing. 
 just 
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well. 
well
Now obviously, every time I bring this up, people even, you know, here at the conference, say, "Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?" 
you know
I'm just going to focus on a few of them, and let's start with fire, because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now. 
 just 
Well, mass timber panels, these new products that we're using, are much like the log. 
well
We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change. 
 just 
It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent, and we don't really feel comfortable with it. 
 just 
There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11. 
 just 
These are big brains, highly social animals, and I thought, well, if we give them choice and control, if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard -- and by the way, it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett-Packard with an Apple II computer. 
well
 So I'm just behind, jamming, yeah, this is what we started with. 
 just 
So if we could switch to the audio from this computer, we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals, and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. 
 just 
Well, my name is Allison Ginsburg, and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. 
well
Okay, that's great, thank you. 
okay
NG: Okay, that's great. Thanks Josh. 
okay
And once again, we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing. 
 just 
This is the system as it looks today, by the way. 
by the way
Well, you know where this is headed. 
well
We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person. 
 just 
Well, you can see what's coming next. 
well
Well, let's see. 
well
NG: And just mechanically, there's a 501 and web infrastructure and all of that, but it's not quite ready to turn on, so we'll roll that out, and contact us if you want the information on it. 
 just 
And very quickly, just to clarify. 
 just 
Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought, well, that's just a webcam. 
well
If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that? 
 just 
This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work, and we just got our first seed money today towards that, so it's our first project. 
 just 
JC: Wow. Well done. 
well
All right, well thank you all so much for joining us. 
well
And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task, and finally, on the 4,000th try, when I'm close to losing my sanity, I find the protein. 
 just 
And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin, and it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein, unless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream. 
 just 
  And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes, and that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon that's an atom thick, and one 50,000th the diameter of your hair. 
 just 
Ph.D.s just flock into this little room, and they're just firing these questions at me, and by the end, I kind of felt like I was in a clown car. 
 just 
 However, subjecting myself to that interrogation -- I answered all their questions, and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right -- and I finally landed the lab space I needed. 
i guess
So that ranges from heart disease, to malaria, HIV, AIDS, as well as other forms of cancer -- anything. 
well
It's just your ideas that count. 
 just 
For me, it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way, to realize that there's so much more to it than just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online. 
 just 
So if a 15 year-old who didn't even know what a pancreas was could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer -- just imagine what you could do. 
 just 
They were just there, but they had no significance. 
 just 
Well, I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life. 
well
To me, this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player and hearing just that one part. 
 just 
 Well, a year later I returned, and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions, I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses, and now this is what we've got. 
well
Well, I've returned to Lincoln Meadow 15 times and I can tell you that the biophony, the density and diversity of that biophony, has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation. 
well
 At the end of its breeding cycle, the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desert soil of the American West, where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again. 
 just 
 Mono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park and it's a favorite habitat of these toads, and it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots, who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the Mono Basin, very fast, very low, and so loud that the anthrophony, the human noise, 
 just 
even though it's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago, it masked the sound of the chorusing toads. 
 just 
 Yeah. Well. 
well
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist?" 
you see
And I say all this just to stress how very old-fashioned and straightforward my background is, because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver, most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi-cultured than I am. 
 just 
And when I woke up the next morning, I was sleeping on a friend's floor, the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush I had just bought from an all-night supermarket. 
 just 
And the number of us who live outside the old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly, by 64 million just in the last 12 years, that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans. 
 just 
More and more of us are rooted in the future And home, we know, is not just the place where you happen to be born. 
 just 
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed — "Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage." 
well
I just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones. 
 just 
And I started to go back to this place, and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still, and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way I never could when I was racing from the last email to the next appointment. 
 just 
And I've noticed so many people now take conscious measures to sit quietly for 30 minutes every morning just collecting themselves in one corner of the room without their devices, or go running every evening, when they go to have a long conversation with a friend. 
 just 
And home, in the end, is of course not just the place where you sleep. 
 just 
Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment. 
well
You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near. 
you see
No, better yet, a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind. 
 just 
Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled to 1.7 trillion, and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class, whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. 
well
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of "crony capitalism," political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. 
well
Well, a few things. 
well
And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage? 
 just 
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills, it worked out pretty well, didn't it? 
well
After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller -- well, there are a few exceptions — and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century. 
well
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats, we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. 
 just 
 ♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫ ♫ She's just a girl who claims that I am the one ♫ ♫ But the kid is not my son ♫  All right. 
 just 
If you guys haven't figured it out already, my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer, which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice, and the only thing was my voice. 
 just 
And I'm very, very stoked —  You guys are just applauding for everything. It's great. 
 just 
You know, I'm from Brisbane, which is a great city to live in. 
you know
 You know, I'm from Brizzy, which is a great city to live in, but let's be honest -- it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere. 
you know
I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here. 
 just 
So I think, I found the best way to describe my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life. 
 just 
There's three particular things that I've done, and I'll just describe those first, and then talk about some of my work. 
 just 
It's more that I just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different. 
 just 
Obviously, one of the most important things was the sheep, and so my job was, well, pretty much to do everything, but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead. 
well
And what I learned was, although at the time, like everyone else, I thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn't do what we wanted them to do, what I realize now, probably only just in the last few weeks looking back, is the sheep weren't stupid at all. 
 just 
It's just you do it by changing an environment. 
 just 
And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this, which, you know, as we've heard from other people, that's the thing that makes you do it. 
you know
And a lot of that learning, I think, came from being on that farm, because when I was working on the farm, we'd have to use what was around us, we'd have to use the environment, and there was no such thing because you're in an environment where, if you can't do what you need to do, you can die, and, you know, I had seen that sort of thing happen. 
you know
So what we do is we take conventional printing presses, we make conductive inks, and run those through a press, and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive. 
 just 
It's just a collection of things that have been done before, but bringing them together in a different way. 
 just 
So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created. 
 just 
So we're trying to create that connection between the physical and the digital, but have it not looking on a screen, and just looking like a regular poster. 
 just 
You can hear a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about. 
well
And you can press a Facebook "like" button or you can vote on something as well. 
well
Okay. 
okay
I'll just describe how this works. 
 just 
Okay. Thanks. 
okay
So this one is like a sound board, so you can touch it, and I just love these horrible noises. 
 just 
 Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable. 
okay
Oh, yes. I just love doing that. 
 just 
I'm not a D.J., though, but I just always wanted to do that. 
 just 
I just love bringing technology together, having a lot of fun, being creative. 
 just 
It's just about, I want to create some great experiences. 
 just 
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject, both in our scientific and our philosophical culture. 
well
Well, it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple, logical reason, namely, it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious. 
well
And then, even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research, well, it's been slow. Progress has been slow. 
well
When I first got interested in this, I thought, well, it's a straightforward problem in biology. 
well
But the thing that struck me is, one guy said in exasperation, a very famous neurobiologist, he said, "Look, in my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness, but get tenure first. Get tenure first." 
okay
Okay, now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness? 
okay
Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions. 
well
Okay, now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness. 
okay
Two: Well, maybe it exists, but it's really something else. 
well
Watch. I decide consciously to raise my arm, and the damn thing goes up.  Furthermore, notice this: We do not say, "Well, it's a bit like the weather in Geneva. 
well
No. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to. 
well
Okay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible. 
okay
But they think, "Well, if that's it, that's an awful problem. 
well
And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules, so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious, depending on the behavior of the molecules. 
 just 
Well, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible. 
well
You see, the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. 
you see
I mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say, "We are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious, you are a very cleverly constructed robot," I don't think, "Well, maybe these guys are right, you know?" 
well
I don't think that for a moment, because, I mean, Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this. 
i mean
Okay, that's the first feature of consciousness. 
okay
Okay, the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us, and that is, all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them. 
okay
Okay. Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields. 
okay
So I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor, but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward. 
 just 
Okay, the next feature of consciousness, after this marvelous unified conscious field, is that it functions causally in our behavior. 
okay
Well, I'll tell you the answer. 
well
I mean, we don't know the detailed answer, but we know the basic part of the answer, and that is, there is a sequence of neuron firings, and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons. 
i mean
Okay, now with that in mind, with going through these various features of consciousness, let's go back and answer some of those early objections. 
okay
But the second one had an incredible influence, and may still be around, and that is, "Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else. 
well
I mean, anybody who's thought about computers at all can see that that's wrong, because computation is defined as symbol manipulation, usually thought of as zeros as ones, but any symbols will do. 
i mean
Now that argument, I made that argument 30 -- oh my God, I don't want to think about it — more than 30 years ago, but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you, and I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is, consciousness creates an observer-independent reality. 
 oh 
I mean, you have patients that actually suffer pains, and you try to get an objective science of that. 
i mean
Okay, I promised to refute all these guys, and I don't have an awful lot of time left, but let me refute a couple more of them. 
okay
Well, think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior. 
well
So what's starting to happen, if you think about money, if you sort of boil money down to an essence, it is literally just an expression of value, an agreed value. 
 just 
You know, reputations are built on trust, consistency, transparency. 
you know
You know, when you are standing in line in Starbucks, 30 percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day are actually being made with Starbucks Star points. 
you know
So suddenly, you start thinking, well Amazon potentially could push this. 
well
It could become a natural extension, that as well as buying stuff -- take it out of the Kindle -- you could buy books, music, real-life products, appliances and goods and so on. 
well
And what they're saying, so some criminologists have looked at this and they're saying, well, okay, Tide as a product sells at a premium. 
well
So Nike is literally acting as a well-being partner, a health and fitness partner and service provider. 
well
In Africa, you know, airtime has become literally a currency in its own right. 
you know
And we did a survey that backs up the fact that, you know, 45 percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the U.S. 
you know
You know, you think about, brands are starting to fill the gaps. 
you know
So I think, you know, will we be standing on stage buying a coffee -- organic, fair trade coffee -- next year using TED florins or TED shillings? 
you know
A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth, and in his case, as you can see, the right part of his brain has gone. 
 just 
It's just like, he would like to move his left side of his body, but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg. 
 just 
Questions, some basics, like, you know, why did this happen to us? 
you know
I mean, at the end, will he be able to work? 
i mean
And, you know, as a parent, especially for the first time, why is he not going to be better than us? 
you know
I mean, the only real product of our life, at the end, was a failure. 
i mean
And you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself, but it was a failure that will impact his full life. 
you know
I mean we went really down, but at the end, we started to look at him, and we said, we have to react. 
i mean
I mean, at the end, my wife and myself are quite different, but we have many things in common. 
i mean
We love to travel, we love music, we love to be in places like this, and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him. 
 just 
I am not saying --  — I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message, because we are just at the beginning of the path. 
 just 
But we want to share what was the key learning, the key learning that Mario drove to us, and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss, and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity. 
 just 
My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine. 
 just 
So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor, and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money. 
 just 
She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare. 
 just 
It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had. 
 just 
Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett, and she rolls through the grass, and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude. 
 just 
So sustainability is quite important for us, which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values. 
well
But at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future. 
 just 
It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology. 
 just 
I just want to show you here what we are doing today. 
 just 
And the same approach can be applied to technology as well. 
well
You see the defibrillator. You see the equipment. 
you see
He just needed someone helping him. 
 just 
We were so scared and we just ran away. 
 just 
We'll buy these beepers, just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper, and we will run and save lives." 
 just 
Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old. I was a kid. 
well
So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives, and they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in, they just stop everything and go and run and save a life. 
 just 
We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive. 
 just 
You know, Israelis are good in technology. 
you know
So I went ahead, full force --  — and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem, and that's why the names United and Hatzalah match so well. 
well
I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob, and it works. 
i guess
We just need a good idea, motivation and lots of chutzpah, and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved. 
 just 
I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high, and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft. 
well
Now appearances, of course, can be deceptive, and to an extent, this feisty, energetic persona of lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer, albeit a very well-crafted and convincing one. 
well
This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself, and as the first semester ended and the second began, there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen. 
 just 
I was leaving a seminar when it started, humming to myself, fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before, when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe, "She is leaving the room." 
 just 
It started off quite small, for example, pull out three strands of hair, but gradually it grew more extreme, culminating in commands to harm myself, and a particularly dramatic instruction: "You see that tutor over there? 
you see
You see that glass of water? 
you see
Well, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students." 
well
Sometimes, you know, it snows as late as May, but summer always comes eventually." 
you know
I've got a plastic fork, don't you know?" 
you know
Little did I know that it was mine as well. 
well
And as I sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree, in the dark, there was no electricity, just the full moon, down in this empty square, and I heard the most beautiful sounds, like a Charles Ives concert as I listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once-every-five-years ceremony. 
 just 
And you see the mechanics. 
you see
And being a theater person, what I know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief, when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads, you know it's the savanna. 
you know
But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks. 
 just 
And all of a sudden, I thought, "Well, who am I gonna get to play Prospero? 
well
And this material really did work for a woman equally as well. 
well
 JT: Okay. 
okay
But I'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema. 
 just 
Well, one last story, very quickly. 
well
And you just stay going forward, and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes. 
you see
Well, we start our life with the racing car. 
well
But it's not enough just to have data and measure it. 
 just 
Okay, so let's have a look at a little bit of data. 
okay
And so we installed a real-time link between the ambulance and the hospital, just using normal 3G telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care. 
 just 
He replied, "Don't you know what they call it?" 
you know
Well, while we are here, there are many people like me, who would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past, just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. 
well
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform? 
 just 
Language isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths. 
 just 
As you can probably well imagine, I was a strange child. 
well
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. 
 just 
Why do this?  Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd, I suppose, is the easy answer. 
i suppose
So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see. 
you see
And I'm not just an academic, I'm a philosopher, so I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing. 
 just 
And the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that. 
okay
Why is it that I'm okay with losing and why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing? 
okay
Well, there are some other puzzles. 
well
Well, my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments. 
well
The first model -- let's call it the dialectical model -- is we think of arguments as war; you know what that's like -- a lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing. 
you know
You know, presenting a sound, well-argued, tight argument in English before a francophone audience just isn't going to work. 
well
And let me explain what I mean. 
i mean
And I say, "Well, why do you believe P?" 
well
And I object and say, "Well, what about ...?" 
well
And I have a question: "Well, what do you mean? 
well
And so at the end of the day, I say, "You know what? I guess you're right: P." 
you know
So, I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief; it's well-articulated, examined -- it's a battle-tested belief. 
well
Well, the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won, even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain. 
well
But just from a cognitive point of view, who was the winner? 
 just 
In order to do that, well -- I don't know how to do that. 
well
The argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. 
 just 
It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it. 
 just 
If you're laughing, you know what I mean. 
you know
Now, as you know, sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day. 
you know
So in the morning, you see which direction the sunflower is facing, and you mark it on the blank area in the base. 
you see
Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell. 
 just 
I thought my idea was pretty good, but his idea is genius, and at the time, I knew his idea was better than mine, but I just couldn't explain why. 
 just 
This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade. 
well
Now, for a period of three years, I gathered data, not just me but also some of my friends, and I used to teach in university, so I forced my -- I mean, I asked my students to do this as well. 
well
You know.  Needless to say, I no longer dine with these people. 
you know
Here I found touch is at [six], and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience, which shows, it's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers. 
well
You see, my clock only focuses on sight, and a little bit of touch. 
you see
You see, up till now, us designers, we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty, and a little bit of touch, which means we've ignored the other three senses. 
you see
Chris's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product. 
 just 
This is an iron, you know, for your clothes, to which I added a spraying mechanism, so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent, and your clothes will smell nicer, but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. 
you know
It's not just the way they look, but I love the way they feel when you press down on them. 
 just 
Africa has had a long tradition of writing, but this is not such a well-known fact, and I wrote the book "Afrikan Alphabets" to address that. 
well
These secret societies of the Yoruba, Kongo and Palo religions in Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively, developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the New World in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti. 
well
Africa has had a long tradition of design, a well-defined design sensibility, but the problem in Africa has been that, especially today, designers in Africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration. 
well
Over here, you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far, starting with the letter A, "ālep," at the top, and "bêt," in the middle, and so forth. 
you see
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing, but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today. 
 just 
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring, some sort of musical gift. 
you know
But out of all the bashing, after a few months, emerged the most fantastic music, and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek, when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard. 
 just 
 I think that's just fantastic. 
 just 
You know, there's this little child who can't see, can't really understand much about the world, has no one in the family who plays an instrument, and yet he taught himself to play that. 
you know
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old, and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest, because when you played the piano, you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard, and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way. 
you see
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room, and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back, I could just play something very quickly for him to learn. 
well
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay. 
 just 
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really. 
 just 
But the orchestra were wowed as well, and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces. 
well
And so whenever you heard any note at all -- if I just play a random note --  -- you knew instantly what it was, and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano. 
well
If I just put the microphone down for a bit, I'm going to play a cluster of notes. 
 just 
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds, not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing, Derek, you can hear every note, and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice, reproduce those on the keyboard, that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability. 
 just 
Well done. 
well
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one. 
 just 
 AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek. 
well
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate, all the pieces in the world that are out there. 
you see
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?" 
well
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all, because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know, you're invited to come and sing it first, and then he'll pick it up."  So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish. 
 just 
DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose? AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out. 
 just 
   AO: Well done. 
well
 But in America, they've coined this term, "the human iPod" for Derek, which I think is just missing the point, really, because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod. 
 just 
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go. 
 just 
1986, much, much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues, I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure. 
 just 
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet. 
you see
They're so poor, and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season, In the shelters built by the U.N., they were just providing a plastic sheet, and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this. 
 just 
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem. 
 just 
And this is a very interesting photo: former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso -- you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year. 
you know
So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes, just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain. 
 just 
We really just don't think about sleep. 
 just 
Well, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night, and we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we've treated sleep as an illness, almost. 
well
At most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep, and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure. 
i suppose
Well, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems. 
well
Well, most of us anyway. 
well
However, it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it. 
 just 
I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class, you know, the equivalent of. 
you know
Well, my goodness gracious. 
well
Well, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep, because that's what your brain is craving. 
well
Well, of course, you then resort to alcohol. 
well
Now alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful. 
you know
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone. 
well
And one of the things of stress, of course, is loss of memory, which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of. 
 just 
So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain, which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides. 
 just 
Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive. 
well
Well, it's not rocket science. 
well
Well -- and this is slightly offensive -- sleep for dummies. 
well
that you know are going to ease you off into the honey-heavy dew of slumber. 
you know
Well, that's wrong at so many different levels. 
well
In my experience, the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug. 
 just 
In the 1970s, when people started to think about this again, they said, "Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia, because they're on antipsychotics. 
well
Well, genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep, when mutated, when changed, also predispose individuals to mental health problems. 
well
So let me just finish. 
 just 
Ah yes, those university days, a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics and world debating championships, or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah." 
 oh 
And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard about Australians are true. 
you know
I just politely raised my hand, and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said, in front of my year two classmates, and I quote, "But Miss, surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle, well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole." 
well
But the third thing about prime numbers, mathematicians have always wondered, well at any given moment in time, what is the biggest prime that we know about? 
well
If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay? 
okay
But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes, we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power. 
 just 
Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting. 
 just 
And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians, he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk, and started writing out the powers of two: two, four, eight, 16 -- come on, join in with me, you know how it goes -- 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048. 
you know
I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet: "Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?" 
you see
The girls just shook their heads, put them in their hands, and let me go my own way. 
 just 
For the slightly less geeky of you, think about the Harry Potter novels, okay? 
okay
Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful. 
 just 
And within just 50 years, in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience, we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind. 
 just 
I know what I have just said is simply not obvious. 
 just 
You know, Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war. 
you know
Long distance running was not only good for my well-being but it helped me meditate and dream big. 
well
I didn't want to pity myself, nor to be pitied, and I thought by organizing such a marathon, I'll be able to pay back to my community, build bridges with the outside world, and invite runners to come to Lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace. 
 um
Themes have included runs for the environment, breast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, for peace, or just simply to run. 
 just 
The first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment, has just taken place only a few weeks ago, with 4,512 women, including the first lady, and this is only the beginning. 
 just 
I had just gone through a breakup. 
 just 
So what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with? 
 just 
XL: Indeed. This is way more difficult than, let's say, finding a needle in a haystack, because at least, you know, the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on. 
you know
SR: So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment, in a very real sense, there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. 
you know
They're sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active. 
 just 
The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells, but the green brain cells, the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory. 
you see
SR: So electricity is pretty fast, but we probably wouldn't be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory, and we'd probably fry the brain. 
 just 
SR: So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light. 
 just 
So maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light -- XL: That's pretty fast. 
 just 
So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light-sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see. 
you see
Now to bring back to life the memory of that day, I remember that the Red Sox had just won, it was a green spring day, perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis, #justsaying. 
 just 
But the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode. 
you see
 So after the experiment, the two of us just left the room without saying anything. 
 just 
SR: "Did that just work?" 
 just 
["This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED"] XL: Indeed, if we take a look at the second one, I think we can all agree that it's, meh, probably not as positive. 
 oh 
XL: So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic, but if just for simplicity, let's imagine memory as a movie clip. 
 just 
Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before, but at the same time, if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory, this will change the memory. 
 just 
Again, we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks, and now the animal suddenly freezes. 
 just 
SR: For example, one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory, just like that. 
 just 
That's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes. 
i mean
These are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab, and so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible in modern neuroscience, but now, just as importantly, to actively engage everybody in this conversation. 
 just 
This is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings. 
 just 
But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. 
 just 
I was a little conflicted though, because I was so excited about what I'd found, but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science, and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington, D.C., and sitting at a desk and working in government. 
 just 
It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. 
 just 
And if I wanted to paint on people, well, I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. 
well
Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk, it would wash all the paint off of her arms, and it might seem a little bit clumsy, but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms. 
okay
And one time, she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. 
 just 
All right, well, hide your face. 
well
And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined, even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands, just hiding them in the pockets. 
 just 
But then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar, as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light, that you can see what's below the surface, hiding in the shadows, and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye. 
i guess
In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress. 
 just 
For me. Okay. 
okay
Okay, so you get the idea. 
okay
And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. 
well
And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed. 
well
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s. 
well
And we just did a little intervention. 
 just 
Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? 
okay
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain. 
well
Okay, so the bad news first: For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent. 
okay
And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement. 
 just 
To conquer uncertainty, to know what comes next, that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies, and having got there, or almost got there, we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs. 
 just 
I just wanted a richer and rawer life than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed, that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world. 
 just 
It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while. 
 just 
The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them, had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park, and despite efforts by humans to control them, they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away. 
 just 
In some areas, the height of the trees quintupled in just six years. 
 just 
Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well, partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs, and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer. 
well
Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides, there was less soil erosion, because the vegetation stabilized that as well. 
well
So the wolves, small in number, transformed not just the ecosystem of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land, but also its physical geography. 
 just 
One of the many post-rational excuses made by the Japanese government for killing whales is that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise and then there'll be more for people to eat." 
well
Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of kind of makes sense, doesn't it, because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away, there'll be more fish and krill. 
well
Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem, and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes, huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters, up in the photic zone, where there's enough light to allow photosynthesis to take place, and those great plumes of fertilizer 
well
And interestingly, well, we know that plant plankton in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere -- the more plant plankton there are, the more carbon they absorb -- and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system. 
well
Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations, they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon And when you look at it like that, you think, wait a minute, here are the wolves changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park. 
well
Well, every continent had one, apart from Antarctica. 
well
And the question is, who do you want to remember -- if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother? 
 just 
I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project. 
 just 
This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself. 
you see
We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that, when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself. 
 just 
And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it, but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history. 
 just 
And we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage, so you're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building, or making their way down the stairwells. 
well
So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices, but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. 
 just 
 Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience. 
 just 
Well, I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University, and for those 25 years, tape recorders were everything to me. 
well
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen. 
you see
 But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --   Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. 
you know
 You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep. 
you see
  This technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iPhone and on yours as well. 
well
But, you know, I find reading with machines a very lonely process. 
you know
Well, because we can't transport books across borders, there had to be separate versions read in all the different English-speaking countries: Britain, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter. 
well
Well, many of you have the image, don't you, of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement, hacking away for notoriety. 
well
If you want your business competitors to go down, well, they can. 
well
If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will. 
well
Well, you could try looking really cute. 
well
Or just to really prove a point, we can launch programs like my personal favorite, the Windows Calculator. 
 just 
So let's imagine that our attacker, called Evil Hacker just for comedy value, inserts something a little nasty. 
 just 
That website address at the top there, which you can just about see, microshaft.com, the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs, and up pops fake antivirus. 
 just 
Using the email address, the telephone number and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling, on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens. 
you see
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well. 
well
Let me come back to that in just a minute. 
 just 
Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks. 
okay
Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live. 
well
And I should mention as well that some of you do use your names, "James Lyne's iPhone," for example. 
well
You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate, and that 250,000 pieces of malware won't stay the same for long. 
you see
But my biggest ask is this: You see, you're going to leave here and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news. 
you see
You just looked at your clock, right? 
 just 
I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard there's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes. 
 just 
Now, instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side, instead, what I choose to focus on is Frank, to be able to play with the Frank inside your head, your security guard, and get you, instead of focusing on your external senses, just to go internal for a second. 
 just 
What just happened? Do you have a wallet? 
 just 
Lovely watch, it doesn't come off very well. 
well
Do you have a ring as well? 
well
Good. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet. 
 just 
Hi, sir, could you stand up, please? Just right where you are. 
 just 
You're married, you follow directions well. 
well
Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well. 
well
AR: Well, we'll find one for you. Come on up this way, Joe. 
well
Turn around and, let's see, if I give you something that belongs to me, this is just something I have, a poker chip. 
 just 
Make it harder for me. Just use your hand. 
 just 
Did you see it go? Joe: No. 
you see
We're just shopping. This trick's more about the timing. 
 just 
Did you see it go? 
you see
AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way, better than you know. 
you know
So, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you. 
i guess
And it's not just our honeybees. 
 just 
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers -- but when bees have access to good nutrition, we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services. 
 just 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question. 
 just 
And then we thought, you know, there are thousands of other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks, that are popping up all over the world. 
you know
And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply, is the mathematics that underlies an idea, and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it, which I want to share with you now. 
you know
EB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk, they're linked if they share similar ideas, and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts, and then all these topics that pop out, they're not from tags and keywords. 
 just 
And of course, from here, we can go and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at? 
well
EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here, you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. 
 just 
We might just say, well, what are the most popular talks out there? 
well
And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year. 
well
But there's so much creative content that's just buried at the bottom. 
 just 
Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that. 
well
Remember, it's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics, and let's say we could take two of them, like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines. 
well
Well here's one by Jessica Green about the microbial ecology of buildings. 
well
And we could go back to those topics and say, well, what talks are central to those conversations? 
well
We could go the other direction and say, well, what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields. 
well
And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist, and I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space?" 
well
Okay? We never would have found those with our obsession with what's trending now. 
okay
Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods? 
you know
Animals are not just raw materials. 
 just 
There is another way, because essentially, animal products are just collections of tissues, and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues. 
 just 
We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. 
 just 
You see, Titus' car sort of resembled a car that was driven earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker, and Titus kind of resembled that rapist. 
you see
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system, and yet he got an idea. 
well
Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case. 
well
He spent every waking moment thinking about it, and just days before he was to have his day in court, he woke up in the morning, doubled over in pain, and died of a stress-related heart attack. 
 just 
Well, why? 
well
You just record the information, then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images. 
 just 
And you might be thinking, well, you know, these are filmed events, they are not particularly stressful. 
well
Well out there in the real world, misinformation is everywhere. 
well
And you might be thinking, well, that's not particularly stressful. 
well
Well, to my surprise, when I published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy, it created some pretty bad problems for me: hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists, who felt under attack, and by the patients whom they had influenced. 
well
Well, along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues, like, when should we use this mind technology? 
well
Hello, Santa Claus.  I mean, another way to think about this is, which would you rather have, a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan, all the things that go with it, or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory? 
i mean
If I've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems, it's this: just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence, just because they say it with lots of detail, just because they express emotion when they say it, it doesn't mean that it really happened. 
 just 
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind, we'd do well to, that memory, like liberty, is a fragile thing. 
well
We do this by studying the sense of smell, the sense of olfaction, and in the laboratory, it's a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working, and, well, frankly, it's kind of exhilarating. 
well
Well, the course I was and am teaching is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I.  It's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts, it uses this giant book called "Principles of Neural Science" by three famous neuroscientists. 
well
And they must also have this idea, I suppose, that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books. 
i suppose
So I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course on ignorance, something I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example. 
well
I mean a different kind of ignorance. 
i mean
I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative, a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge, something that's just not there to be known or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from, the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell, perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein, who said, "Thoroughly conscious ignorance 
well
So what do we do about this? Well, the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect, if you will. 
well
We just don't worry about it, in a way. 
 just 
We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is, or we could just wait for it to melt, I suppose, these days, but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right? 
 just 
I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well, where no matter how many buckets you take out, there's always another bucket of water to be had, or my particularly favorite one, with the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond. 
well
This is really well said, I thought, by George Bernard Shaw. 
well
This is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work, in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers. ["Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating 10 more."] I find that kind of glorious, and I think he's precisely right, plus it's a kind of job security. 
 just 
Because, you know, there's low-quality ignorance and there's high-quality ignorance. It's not all the same. 
you know
This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it. 
you know
So what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course, and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot. 
you know
Now you look at a master's student, a little further along in their education, and you see they know a bit more, but it's been narrowed somewhat. 
you see
by just changing the label on the x-axis. 
 just 
So instead of how much you know about it, we could say, "What can you ask about it?" 
you know
So yes, you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist, but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek, right? 
 just 
So, for example, we could say, well what is it that the brain does? 
well
Well, one thing the brain does, it moves us around. 
well
I mean, virtually everybody over 10 months of age walks around on two legs, right? 
i mean
I mean, we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff. 
i mean
Indeed, there are over 12,000 neuroscientists who work on the visual system, from the retina to the visual cortex, in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain might work. 
 just 
These are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face, you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose. 
 just 
I mean, that's remarkable to me, clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet. 
i mean
And I also think it's important to realize that the conversation's been going on for a while, by the way. 
by the way
We just can't sell facts for a living anymore. 
 just 
They're available with a click of the mouse, or if you want to, you could probably just ask the wall one of these days, wherever they're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff. 
 just 
So what do we have to do? We have to give our students a taste for the boundaries, for what's outside that circumference, for what's outside the facts, what's just beyond the facts. 
 just 
Well, one of the problems, of course, turns out to be testing. 
well
You know. You can imagine what it is. 
you know
We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever. 
 just 
So what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say, have an interesting maxim they live by. 
well
Well, we hear a lot about testing and evaluation, and we have to think carefully when we're testing whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding, whether we're weeding people out, whether we're making some cut. 
well
Or, "You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone, I'll phone someone. I'll find out." 
you know
That is, we don't just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests. 
 just 
Well we now know, of course, the answer. 
well
Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age, and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world. 
 just 
He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical, to speculating about what might be, and he found finally that they didn't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions. 
well
And the fellow said, "Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there." 
well
And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village, and there's no room for camels." 
well
Now you see again, this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience, and it was important to that person what color bears were -- that is, they had to hunt bears. 
you see
And you were supposed to think, well, the state legislature was rural-controlled, and they hated the big city, so rather than putting the capital in a big city, they put it in a county seat. 
well
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding. 
well
And it's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions. 
 just 
Compare the banker in 1900, who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage. 
 just 
Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss, but they were cognitively very agile. 
well
So it hasn't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions. 
 just 
And if someone of the older generation says, well, our government takes care of us, and it's up to their government to take care of them, they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously. 
well
Well, he's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited, and they're unmovable in any way by logic. 
well
They're just inherited mores. 
 just 
Today we would say something like, well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized. 
well
And he would say, well that's not in the Koran. 
well
Well you, today, universalize your principles. 
well
You have to say, well, blackness of skin, you couldn't suffer just for that. 
well
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we, and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black. 
well
You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine, the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions, the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet, and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it, and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms, when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost. 
you know
Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling] [Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters underneath the skin." 
well
And I wouldn't be lying, but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either, because the truth is, that's just the life everyone else sees. 
 just 
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means, that might surprise them to hear, because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong, when you break up with your girlfriend, when you lose a loved one, when you don't get the job you wanted. 
 just 
Well, two years ago it was my problem, because I sat on the edge of my bed where I'd sat a million times before and I was suicidal. 
well
Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story, and my story is this: In four simple words, I suffer from depression. 
well
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was, that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was, that beneath my smile, there was struggle, and beneath my light, there was dark, and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain. 
 just 
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. 
 just 
Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to, because that's wishful thinking, and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination, and we can't procrastinate on something this important. 
well
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question. 
well
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves, where we're okay with who we are, because when we get honest, we see that we all struggle and we all suffer. 
okay
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay. 
well
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay. 
okay
And know that you're sick, you're not weak, and it's an issue, not an identity, because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others, you can see depression for what it really is, and that's just a part of life, just a part of life, and as much as I hate, as much as I hate some of the places, some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to, 
 just 
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say, "I'm going through hell," and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay, and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people. 
okay
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel. 
 just 
So finally, to break the deadlock, the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor, and he calls out and he says to the Israelites, "Send your mightiest warrior down, and we'll have this out, just the two of us." 
 just 
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff, and he says -- he's insulted -- "Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?" 
 just 
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket, puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes -- right here, in his most vulnerable spot -- and he falls down either dead or unconscious, and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head, and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run. 
 just 
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid, a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant. 
well
We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior, and David is just a shepherd. 
 just 
Well, let's start there with the phrase "All David has is this sling," because that's the first mistake that we make. 
well
It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry. 
 just 
Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath, an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies. 
well
And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead. 
 just 
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies, proximity to death, or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death, I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. 
 just 
But I see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one. 
 just 
Well, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia, and it's a big city, and I figured, in this entire place, there are lots of possibilities. 
well
In the meantime, my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children, and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already. 
well
Now, I like the idea of online dating, because it's predicated on an algorithm, and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem, I'm going to use some data, run it through a system and get to a solution. 
 just 
So in my case, I thought, well, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming? 
well
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé. 
 just 
He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well, and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table, also lots and lots of bottles of wine. 
well
So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner, and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other, but we'll part ways as friends, when he gets up to go to the bathroom, and in the meantime, the bill comes to our table. 
 just 
 "You're just being too picky." 
 just 
 Well, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys. 
well
There were just bad for me. 
 just 
See, the real problem here is that, while the algorithms work just fine, you and I don't, when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online. 
 just 
For me, the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched. 
 just 
I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children, but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do, so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three, and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it. 
okay
I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams. 
 just 
And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition. 
i guess
I really was just scraping their data. 
 just 
I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract, and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets. 
 just 
What I was trying to get at here was that I figured, in person, I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978. 
 just 
The challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very, very well, even though it may not seem like it all the time. 
well
The other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non-specific language. 
well
Remember, I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that. 
okay
Well, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin, and he said that he was culturally Jewish, he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter, which I thought was very clever. 
well
Three weeks later, we met up in person for what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant, and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re-scored him -- [1,050 points!] Thought, you know what, this entire time, I haven't been picky enough. 
you know
Well, a year and a half after that, we were non-cruise ship traveling through Petra, Jordan, when he got down on his knee and proposed. 
well
Well, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love. 
well
It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online. 
 just 
Well, on my wedding day, I had a conversation again with my grandmother, and she said, "All right, maybe I was wrong. 
well
 At the same time, I probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw. 
 just 
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches, but I got mine indoors, and what happened is that, if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second, you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights. 
 just 
Let's just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent. 
 just 
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with. 
 just 
You wouldn't paint with syringes, but it works just the same. 
 just 
Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle. 
 just 
But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration. 
 just 
Is it just a waste of whiskey? 
 just 
Is it just some strange materials? 
 just 
You can pay them a certain amount of money, they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes, and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins, can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room. 
 just 
Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops? 
you know
Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids, especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard, to do well in school, to apply themselves. 
well
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike, and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation, so in the respect that children, if they would like to read, you just take this incentive away in just paying them, so it just changes behavior. 
 just 
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation should be to learn. 
well
HM: To be frank, I just think this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way. 
 just 
You know, think of the fast food industry, the drug industry, the banking industry. 
you know
You know, this is a low point in the respect for business. 
you know
Well, we've tended to see the solutions in terms of NGOs, in terms of government, in terms of philanthropy. 
well
Well there, I think the answer is very clear: They're in business. 
well
Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit and redeploy it into social problems. 
well
I mean, what we've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure, because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent. 
i mean
You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually, yes, be responsible, but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. 
you see
The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. 
 just 
You just need to look at them a little differently. 
 just 
We put out the orange barrels, and people just materialized immediately into the street. 
 just 
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know? 
you know
You just click it, and they're there. 
 just 
And daily usage just continues to soar. 
 just 
It was just fantastic. 
 just 
You just need to reimagine your streets. 
 just 
In fact, the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region than in the events of 1979, because at this point, Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region, and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners, they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors. 
you see
And I'd heard this before as well. 
well
And then we asked the question, well what really predicts a case of violence? 
well
And the second thing to do, of course, is to prevent further spread, that means to find who else has been exposed, but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of T.B., or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods, but in the same group, and then they need to be, in a way, managed as well, particular to the specific disease process. 
well
So violence interruptors hired from the same group, credibility, trust, access, just like the health workers in Somalia, but designed for a different category, and trained in persuasion, cooling people down, buying time, reframing. 
 just 
So anyway, additionally, there was still this problem, and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems. 
well
Where there's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment, where there's a 55-percent drop in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico, where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras, where the strategy has been applied in Kenya for the recent elections, and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq. 
 just 
And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. 
well
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create. 
 just 
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. 
 just 
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. 
 just 
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. 
 just 
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line. 
 just 
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text. 
 just 
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. 
well
So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks. 
 just 
When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia, said these words in 1775, he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come. 
 just 
"Give me liberty or give me death" is all well and good if you can afford it, but if you're living on less than one dollar a day, you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy. 
well
Now, I know many people in this room and around the world will think, "Well actually, this is hard to grasp," because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. 
well
It's not just in economics, but it's also in terms of living standards. 
 just 
This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country -- she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States -- but even if you look to places like Africa, China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo, which is 9,000 miles, or three times the distance of New York to California. 
 just 
In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, not just China, have shown that actually, it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. 
 just 
Well, the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism; greater protectionisms of nation-states; but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago, ever-declining political rights and individual rights. 
well
The other option is for the West to cooperate, and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them. 
i mean
Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China, and this is a way, in other words, for the West to take a back seat. 
well
By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use, and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas-belching, time-wasting and life-threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to, most Americans, in fact, need, just to live their daily lives. 
 just 
You know, we say, half the world is living in cities. 
you know
Well, in America, that living in cities, for many of them, they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. 
well
And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today. 
you see
So if they're not spending that money on driving -- and by the way, 85 percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy -- if they're not spending that money on driving, what are they spending it on? 
by the way
Well, Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita, the most independent bookstores per capita, the most strip clubs per capita. 
well
Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood, you were 35 percent likely to be overweight. 
well
Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000. 
well
Do you know where it's three per 100,000? 
you know
Until some economists said, you know, is that the right way to measure CO2? 
you know
And they said, let's measure CO2 per household, and when they did that, the maps just flipped, coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs, and red hot in these exurban "drive till you qualify" neighborhoods. 
 just 
Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings, it's called the Mercer Survey. 
well
And you see this alignment, this strange alignment. 
you see
Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab, and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time. 
by the way
And actually, the structure of those tissues is quite different, and it's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease, other conditions, in terms of how and you're going to need to think about the materials you're going to use really carefully, their biochemistry, their mechanics, and many other properties as well. 
well
And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest, which is just here, and then transplant that somewhere else in the body. 
 just 
And it actually works really well, because it's your own bone, and it's well vascularized, which means it's got a really good blood supply. 
well
So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg, so the bone marrow, then you can see the original bone, and you can see where that original bone finishes, and just to the left of that is the new bone that's grown within that bioreactor cavity, and you can actually make it even larger. 
 just 
And I'm just going to tell you, sometimes those contacts are very strange, slightly unexpected, and the very most interesting, let me put it that way, contact that I had, was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head. 
 just 
And this approach works really well, I think, for pre-planned procedures, but it's something you do have to pre-plan. 
well
And so I'm showing here just two examples where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure, and you can really tailor it. 
 just 
Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease, because this is a really big clinical problem. 
 just 
But now, the cells also would probably quite like a material that's going to be able to be conductive, because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals between themselves. 
well
So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that being able to work in this sort of field, all of us that work in this field that's not only super-exciting science, but also has the potential to impact on patients, however big or small they are, is really a great privilege. 
 just 
And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well. 
well
At these large-scale construction sites in China, you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. 
you see
Just over three years ago, I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela, and while flying over the city, I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city, a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums, draped literally all over the mountains. 
 just 
But when you look up closely, you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through. 
you see
When a new inhabitant moves into the tower, they already have a roof over their head, so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. 
 just 
It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making, like when everything is made out of red bricks, some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish. 
 just 
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade, you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic, intuitive way that responds directly to their needs. 
you see
Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a community called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. 
 just 
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. 
you see
Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. 
well
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden. 
you see
With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. 
 just 
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities, but in the early 1980s, they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. 
 just 
While to most of us, living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable, to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just a different type of normal. 
 just 
Throughout the day, it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets, just like this engagement party. 
 just 
These dwellings are called the yaodongs. 
well
In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape, and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square, rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. 
you see
Today, you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. 
you see
So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband. 
 just 
"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?" 
well
Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. 
well
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope. 
 just 
And I hear the medical professionals say, "Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial. 
well
It's not just families either. 
 just 
You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure. 
well
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead." 
 just 
Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, "You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal." 
you know
You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human. 
 just 
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end. 
 just 
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy? 
you know
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing." 
well
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive. 
well
You know the incident. 
you know
Well, we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity. 
well
Do you see the subject? 
you see
Well, the computer did, and in fact did so for one out of three subjects. 
well
Do you see where I'm going with this? 
you see
[27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified ] But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time: looking for a match, finding public information, trying to infer sensitive information, and then sending back to the phone 
 just 
In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept. 
 just 
So next time you are looking for a certain product, and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. 
 just 
Again, marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. 
 just 
Even more so than George Orwell, the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley. 
well
And at the risk of playing the serpent, I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here, the awareness of what is going on, and in your hands, just a few clicks away. 
 just 
At first, it was going very well. 
well
So it's not just my father that I've imitated. 
 just 
A few years ago I went to China for a few months, and I couldn't speak Chinese, and this frustrated me, so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart, like music, I guess. 
i guess
He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice. 
well
  HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. 
okay
Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. 
well
But first, let's just take three numbers. 
 just 
It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. 
well
And if you think about it, all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years, much of that is due to just one degree warming, and we need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. 
 just 
So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world. 
 just 
I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. 
well
 It's not just about products in people's homes. 
 just 
When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear, and businesspeople like clarity, because then you just get the job done. 
 just 
So this is a good thing for the CFO, not just the sustainability guy. 
 just 
But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. 
 just 
You know the phrase, you can manage what you measure? 
you know
Well, you should measure what you care about. 
well
Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens. 
 just 
And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. 
 just 
The private sector as well. 
well
And it's not just about African demographics. 
 just 
If you look at the red line here, what you're going to see is that in 1975, just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-Saharan Africa. 
 just 
Each little box is about a billion dollars, and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. 
you see
One guy offered free secondary school education to all, not just 30 percent. 
 just 
You see the middle class grow. 
you see
That new cover shows, well, Africa rising, because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent. 
well
And you know what? 
you know
No, not right now, just 30 seconds. 
 just 
Well, at least, here at CERN. 
well
It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. 
 just 
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse. 
 just 
It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. 
 just 
Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition? 
 just 
In the majority of bubble universes, the Higgs mass could be around the critical value, near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field, because of two competing effects, just as in the case of sand. 
 just 
And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan. Right? 
you know
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet? 
you know
We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right? 
 just 
Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what? 
you know
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. 
 oh 
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something. 
i mean
So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy. 
 just 
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot," but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. 
well
Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. 
 just 
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right? 
i mean
Of course, it's not just the state. 
 just 
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking. 
 just 
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him." 
you know
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
well
If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward? 
 just 
Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet? 
well
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive. 
i mean
And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. 
well
You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. 
you know
Well, unfortunately, that's not true. 
well
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. 
okay
I mean, one can take a position on that. 
i mean
They even got the first -- well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone. 
well
This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments. 
by the way
The Brazilian Development Bank, which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology, they just announced a $56 billion program for the future on this, is retaining equity in these investments. 
 just 
So to put it provocatively, had the U.S. government thought about this, just something called an innovation fund, you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund, there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. 
you know
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, 
 just 
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. 
 just 
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. 
 um
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired. 
 just 
A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well. 
well
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations. 
 just 
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. 
well
Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you. 
 just 
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else. 
 just 
We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. 
 just 
I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. 
 just 
I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air, are among the most highly contaminated on Earth, and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone, and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards. 
i mean
I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? 
i mean
It turns out this holds true for other species as well. 
well
I mean, what about their health? 
i mean
What sounds like faith, soft faith, may actually be fact, because the surprising truth -- I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years, have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years. 
i mean
For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family. 
well
This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete. 
well
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years 
 just 
This is happening just south of the border. 
 just 
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. 
by the way
Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. 
 just 
It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless, ignorant goons that are just shooting each other, very difficult to reconcile. 
 just 
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up. 
 just 
This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy. 
 just 
They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. 
 just 
It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. 
 just 
And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions. 
well
Well, the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. 
well
The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps. 
 just 
But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. 
you know
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. 
 just 
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. 
well
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn't really tell you very much. 
well
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. 
 just 
Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. 
well
But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. 
okay
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here. 
well
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years. 
 just 
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. 
you know
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. 
 just 
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. 
well
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this. 
you know
And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. 
well
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support? 
you know
Well, it's not the war on terror. 
well
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists? 
 just 
But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. 
okay
The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number, or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well. 
well
Do you see it? I'll show it to you. 
you see
Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right? 
well
If I could summarize this in one sentence, it would be this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why. 
 just 
Things were going pretty well. 
well
I know there's a cafe on the corner, and they have chairs out in front, so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street. 
 just 
I just figured I'd made a mistake, and went back to the right, and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. 
 just 
Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee, and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear. 
 just 
Similarly, just through the grip of the cane, you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below, and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. 
 just 
Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space. 
 just 
I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal, and as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street, when all of a sudden, my right hand was just gripped by this guy, and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street, speaking to me in Mandarin. 
 just 
And I know it bothers some of my blind friends, it's not just me. 
 just 
In fact, if I'm feeling down, I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland, I go for a walk, and I feel better like that, in no time at all. 
 just 
And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities, and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. 
well
The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars. 
well
If you're blind, you don't drive.  They don't like it when you drive.  If you design a city with the blind in mind, you design a city with a robust, accessible, well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. 
well
Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo, anywhere where they could find a job that measured up to their educational attainment, because in Oklahoma City, the good jobs just weren't there. 
 just 
Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy, and for the very first time, we started showing up on the lists. 
 just 
Now you know the lists I'm talking about. 
you know
You know, these are cities that, typically, you're not embarrassed to be associated with. 
you know
Well, I finally decided I needed to lose weight, and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before, so I simply stopped eating as much. 
well
We have a great intersection of highways, I mean, literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of. 
i mean
You see, in Oklahoma City, we weren't talking about obesity. 
you see
Well, that's when all hell broke loose. 
well
We're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community. 
well
And so you see this culture starting to shift in Oklahoma City. 
you see
Well, I knew I did, so I picked up the magazine and I began to look, and we weren't on it. 
well
This is true, so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute, you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder, contentment, and creativity, all in the span of one minute. 
 just 
While they're coming up, I should let you know, this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. 
you know
Okay, so most people are familiar with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling. 
okay
Sunni, let's just remind them. 
 just 
Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back. 
okay
And if we had just four people, we would do it just like this, and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. 
 just 
Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people. 
 just 
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check. 
okay
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go. 
okay
Okay? One, two, three, go! 
okay
 Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
well
How many people are like me. Just admit it. 
 just 
It just didn't work out for you. 
 just 
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today. 
okay
Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. 
you know
How many of you won just won thumb? 
 just 
Yes. Awesome. Okay. 
okay
I will just leave you with this tip, if you want to play again. 
 just 
Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system, and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer, a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. 
well
Well, actually, you don't, because the drone flies itself. 
well
Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. 
 just 
Well, when we built our first prototype drone, our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia, to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. 
well
But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. 
 just 
Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. 
 just 
Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. 
 just 
We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. 
 just 
I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. 
i mean
On the screen behind me, you see what we mean by value: outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. 
you see
Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system. 
well
To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. 
you see
Now, if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality, and raise quality just to the level of average OECD, it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year. 
 just 
Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. 
well
They just use a different strategy. 
 just 
Although we flew straight over this bridge, we imaged it in 3D, captured its color in just a few seconds. 
 just 
But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales, and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. 
 just 
If you don't know where the carbon is exactly, in detail, how can you know what you're losing? 
you know
And what's amazing is, even though we flew very high above this forest, later on in analysis, we can go in and actually experience the treetrops, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. 
 just 
Unfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands, but what you see that's left, in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds, is the stuff that's up in the mountains. 
you see
The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially, as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. 
you see
You see the forest in green in 3D, and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. 
you see
Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. 
you see
In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants: wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees. 
 just 
But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa, for example, is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna, and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants, in the red as you see on the screen, and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. 
you see
That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. 
 just 
I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet, but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it. 
 just 
By the way, check out my sweet ride.  Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. 
by the way
I just wish I could afford the tuition.  Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here from your bed in California 3,000 miles away. 
 just 
 Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately? 
okay
Well, you would place a request via mobile phone, and someone would get the request immediately. 
well
These are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes. 
 just 
 And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today, and we're just at the beginning of this. 
 just 
So we said, okay, how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world? 
okay
Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars. 
well
It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24/7, just like the Internet. 
 just 
Well, we chose to do this one not because it's easy, but because it can have amazing impact. 
well
To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I'm about to tell you of practical value, let me ask you please to raise your hands: Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65, raise your hands please.  Okay. You are the people to whom my talk 
okay
This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book, which compares traditional, small, tribal societies with our large, modern societies, with respect to many topics such as bringing up children, growing older, health, dealing with danger, settling disputes, religion and speaking more than one language. 
 just 
The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments, such as the Arctic or deserts, where there are periodic food shortages, and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive. 
 just 
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer. 
well
Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me. 
 just 
In my remaining four minutes today, I can offer just a few suggestions. 
 just 
But what's true of the lives of the elderly is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. 
well
To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. 
 just 
Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. 
 just 
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. 
well
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay? 
okay
So right now, you're doing just fine. 
 just 
They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. 
well
You up for that? Okay. 
okay
I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them. 
 just 
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. 
 just 
Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight. 
okay
It's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering. 
 just 
Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half, right, which is normal. There will be a range. 
okay
Okay? It used to be seven, but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four, and we were overachieving. 
okay
So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him? 
well
I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby," and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head, so my own version. 
 just 
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. 
 just 
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories, just to keep your brain working. 
 just 
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. 
 just 
Well, what about our brain then? 
well
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean. 
 just 
And there, if you do the math, you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos, which seems just right, in a body of some 66 kilos, which in my case is exactly right, which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion: I am a primate. 
 just 
It is just a large primate brain. 
 just 
Well, other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs, and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of, we could do the math. 
well
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. 
 just 
So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons, and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal, the relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we're special. 
 just 
They just can't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons. 
 just 
One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating, but that gets dangerous, and past a certain point, it's just not possible. 
 just 
With our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass, we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding, which is just not feasible. 
 just 
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy as it should, and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding, then the only alternative, really, is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. 
well
So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day than just thinking about food, looking for food, and gobbling down food all day long. 
 just 
So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution, all of the while remaining just a primate brain. 
 just 
There is something you know about me, something very personal, and there is something I know about every one of you and that's very central to your concerns. 
you know
Many people would say, well, that's very easy. 
well
It's just given to you. 
 just 
Well, think again. 
well
How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful, but moment by moment to be grateful. 
 just 
I mean, there's prison costs, there's police costs, there's court costs, all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth? 
i mean
Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model, not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again, but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims? 
 just 
And the investors do not just get their money back, but they make a return. 
 just 
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts, then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment, and if we do better than that, they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment, which is okay. 
okay
The service providers, well, for the first time, they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years, not just one or two as often happens at the moment. 
well
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. 
well
And again, in Peterborough, we started off with a program, but we also collected data, and over the period of time, we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements, so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term: greater engagement from the prisoners, longer-term engagement as well. 
well
It really just isn't working, and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them, and diseases are going untreated. 
 just 
Well, there's a multitude of factors at play, but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work, whether it has efficacy, or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials, are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans. 
well
Well, animals do and can provide extremely useful information. 
well
And at the Wyss Institute, we've done just that. 
 just 
And it's not just beautiful. 
 just 
Well now you're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip. 
well
In that tiny chip, you just witnessed our body has to an infection. 
 just 
Now I want to share this picture with you, not just because it's so beautiful, but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. 
 just 
So a cell biologist like me can come in, take a chip, put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there, put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D., and away you go. 
you see
It would be a personalized chip just for you. 
 just 
I myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache, just couldn't shake it, thought, "Well, I'll try something different." 
well
Well, we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip, having Danielle on a chip, having you on a chip. 
well
I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.  So y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right? 
 just 
It's totally almost just like that. 
 just 
And that's just on air. 
 just 
I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt, and an ugly man, and that was just in one email. 
 just 
Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness. 
well
  Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E. 
 just 
Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive? 
 just 
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. 
by the way
I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised. 
i mean
Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame. 
 just 
I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic, because I don't just get hate mail. 
 just 
More specifically, we created this website, openROV.com, and shared our intentions and our plans For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums, but pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists, and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. 
 just 
And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. 
 just 
But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made, thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us, and we shipped these kits all over the world so it was just a few months ago. 
 just 
Well, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. 
well
That is not just poetry. 
 just 
In fact, it's not just a matter of equity. 
 just 
We fought not just for space for buses, but we fought for space for people, and that was even more difficult. 
 just 
Here, what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy. 
you see
We also built, and this was 15 years ago, before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London, it was a very difficult battle as well, more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways. 
well
They are a right, just as sidewalks are, unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility, without the risk of getting killed. 
 just 
And just as busways are, protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy, because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle to one in a $30,000 car. 
 just 
But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. 
 just 
Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today, "Watch out, a car," the child will jump in fright, and with a very good reason, because there are more than 10,000 children who are killed by cars every year in the world. 
well
In this picture, you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods, we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street, and the cars still in the mud. 
you see
But you see, when a city is only being created, it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure. 
you see
And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it, and it changes the way of life. 
 just 
Pretty much around the same time, I discovered that there were 544 seafarers being held hostage on ships, often anchored just off the Somali coast in plain sight. 
 just 
But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk, I doubt you'd get the same response, even though Maersk, which is just one shipping company amongst many, has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft. 
 just 
It's just something we fly over, a patch of blue on an airline map. 
 just 
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel, you'll see very black smoke. 
well
And that's because shipping has very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel, so they use something called bunker fuel, which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery, or just one step up from asphalt. 
 just 
When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles? 
well
I'd been well treated by the crew, I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain, and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks, something that the captain also said I was crazy to think about. 
well
In this time, it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. 
 just 
So now, I suppose, I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. 
i suppose
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. 
 just 
So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. 
 just 
We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see, and when everything is ready, when you know what is the best recipe and the best form, you start working with the community. 
you know
We just wait for the rain to go. 
 just 
The Gando project was always connected to training the people, because I just wanted, one day when I fall down and die, that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. 
 just 
Yes, you know it. 
you know
I just asked my mother one day, "Why do all these women love me so much?" 
 just 
 She just answered, "They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community." 
 just 
Okay, a few of you. 
okay
Well, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light, because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air. 
well
Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows over 20 feet a year, it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice. 
well
Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels. 
well
So when you're done surveying, you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this, and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage kind of like an ant farm view. 
well
Well not too much lives in them because they're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year. 
well
It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years, and it's just now starting to sprout. 
 just 
Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard, hidden away, just waiting to be found. 
 just 
You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it, because it might be in your own backyard. 
you see
I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart, and so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. 
 just 
He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration, and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. 
 just 
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this. 
 just 
These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being. 
well
If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve, you look up in your rearview mirror, you'd see he'd stopped the car 20, 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something. 
 just 
Now —  Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing. 
you know
In a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others. 
well
But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session. 
 just 
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat. 
well
But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. 
 just 
 And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you." 
well
I mean, that's just incredible humility. 
 just 
You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. 
you know
I do. I was a young boy, and my grandfather had just died, and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened. 
 just 
Well, at some point, all children become aware of death. 
well
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong, distort reality, or see what we want to see, and the bias I'm talking about works like this: Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can, instead, live forever, even if it means taking the existential elevator. 
 just 
Now, this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence, and it works not just for religion, but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form, whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism, which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole. 
 just 
Now, the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory, and the idea is simple. It's just this. 
 just 
And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations, but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take. 
 just 
So 100 years ago, hormones had just been discovered, and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease, and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. 
 just 
But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir, a story that is as old as civilization. 
 just 
And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe, not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. 
 just 
But for others, the whole idea of resurrection, of climbing out of the grave, it's just too much like a bad zombie movie. 
 just 
So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories, and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day. 
 just 
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could. 
well
Now, I find it helps to see life as being like a book: Just as a book is bounded by its covers, by beginning and end, so our lives are bounded by birth and death, and even though a book is limited by beginning and end, it can encompass distant landscapes, exotic figures, fantastic adventures. 
 just 
Now by 2010, as well, popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit, and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city." 
well
It's just after a special mayoral election, and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process, among Detroiters. 
 just 
We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process, and people came out from all over the city, including areas that were stable neighborhoods, as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy. 
well
The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well, up until about 1950, which coincides with the city's peak population at 1.8 million people. 
well
But this time, the migration leaves African-Americans in place, as families and businesses flee the city, leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. 
well
So many people would say to us, "What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland? 
 just 
Now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods, we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises, and we have businesses relocating, and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all, a city that's under the control of an emergency manager, and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. 
 just 
So they, too, could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided. 
well
And not just individual machines, but fleets of locomotives, airplanes, entire systems like power grids, hospitals. 
 just 
So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent; they are brilliant. 
 just 
Well first of all, it's already allowing us to shift towards preventive, condition-based maintenance, which means fixing machines just before they break, without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule. 
well
Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide, and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis. 
 just 
But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the jobs we do every day, because this new wave of innovation is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way, making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding. 
 just 
But think about it: Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad, so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. 
 just 
We are just at the beginning of this transformation, and there will be barriers to break, obstacles to overcome. 
 just 
The economic challenges facing us are hard, but when I walk the factory floor, and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected, and I see the difference this makes in a hospital, in an airport, in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic, I'm enthusiastic. 
 just 
And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day. 
 just 
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee. 
you see
And this is the type of mechanism that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee, and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like, because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think how it all fits together. 
 just 
So world class isn't just about technical performance. 
 just 
So do you see that black strip right there? 
you see
We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things. 
 just 
Well, the standard is, is someone still wearing their knee six months later? 
well
Pournima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg, and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee, and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers, she's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman, because she was in school, she had just started school to study engineering. 
 just 
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies." 
well
And by the way, it's amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me, "Well, are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything?" 
well
That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation, and carry a bowie knife in my mouth, and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them, and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water. 
 just 
It just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me, "But if you're going to take the journey, I'm going to see you through to the end of it, so I'll be there." 
 just 
You can't see the front of your hand, and the people on the boat, Bonnie and my team on the boat, they just hear the slapping of the arms, and they know where I am, because there's no visual at all. 
 just 
And the vomiting starts, the seawater, you're not well, you're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection. 
well
I mean, how long did it take them to build that? 
i mean
It's just -- So, uh, wooo.  And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I'm never told, really, how far it is, because we don't know how far it is. 
 just 
So here we go, and I somehow, without a decision, went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe, I just went into thinking about this dream, and why, and how. 
 just 
And now the shore is coming, and there's just a little part of me that's sad. 
 just 
When are you going to do the next one? We just can't wait to follow the next one." 
 just 
Well, they were just there for 53 hours, and I was there for years. 
well
When Bonnie thought that the back of my throat was swelling up, and she brought the medical team over to our boat to say that she's really beginning to have trouble breathing. 
well
Another 12, 24 hours in the saltwater, the whole thing -- and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment, that I heard the word tracheotomy. 
 just 
 But the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation, it wasn't like that. 
 just 
Poor Player: Just one. 
 just 
Paul Piff: Okay, so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. 
okay
PP: Okay, so no surprises, people are onto us. 
okay
One even asks, like you just saw, is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick? 
 just 
 PP: And as the game went on, one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person, less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor, poor players, and more and more demonstrative of their material success, more likely to showcase how well they're doing. 
well
PP: Okay, and here's what I think was really, really interesting, is that at the end of the 15 minutes, we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. 
okay
And we just monitored how much candy participants took. 
 just 
We've even studied cars, not just any cars, but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law. 
 just 
So we did this for hundreds of vehicles just tracking who stops and who doesn't. 
 just 
What we found was that as the expensiveness of a car increased, the driver's tendencies to break the law increased as well. 
well
And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper, as long as we apply ourselves and work hard, and a piece of that means that sometimes, you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you. 
well
And if it's the case, as we've been finding, that the wealthier you are, the more entitled you feel to that wealth, and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people, and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest, well then there's no reason to think that those patterns will change. 
well
In fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse, and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same, at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years. 
 just 
Now, inequality, economic inequality, is something we should all be concerned about, and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy, but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse, not just the people at the bottom, everyone. 
 just 
Again, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few, but that resound across all strata of society. 
 just 
For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people. 
 just 
In one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them, and after watching that, we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. 
 just 
After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor, suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical, but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values, and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy. 
 just 
I'm sure many of you know the feeling. 
you know
In our modern world of drive-thru burgers, it's not working out so well for many of us. 
well
The other factor, by the way, those of you who are parents, was being teased by family members about their weight. 
by the way
 I left almost all my graphs at home, but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one, because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll. 
 just 
Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. 
 just 
It's just completely different. 
 just 
What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry? 
okay
You know, I don't know how to build a drug. 
you know
In the first phase, you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick. 
you see
In other words, are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does, it's not going to be worth it? 
 just 
In the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective, and what you do there is you give it to people with cancer and you see if it actually makes them better. 
you see
So we did this math, and we figured out, okay, well, you know, you need about 80 to, say, 150, or something like that, drugs. 
well
And then we did a little more math, and we said, okay, well that's a fund of about three to 15 billion dollars. 
well
We wanted to do something more than just make people aware of it, though. 
 just 
 But what we realized was that it's more than just money that's required. 
 just 
But all of us together, with our 401's, with our 529 plans, with our pension plans, all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it and save millions of lives like my dad. 
well
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known. 
well
Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year, seeing how it was 100 years before, 1,000 years before? 
 just 
Maybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible." 
 just 
If I take a log book, I can consider, it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey. 
 just 
In particular, traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts, they do not work well on the handwritten document. 
well
If you have a very good model of a language which is used, if you have a very good model of a document, how well they are structured. 
well
But of course, you cannot understand Venice if you just look at the city. 
 just 
Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year, and vertically, you see the document that served the reconstruction, paintings, for instance. 
you see
Well, the same is true of the music, which my brother and I composed and mapped  I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing -- That's us there. That's both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years, this idea of location-aware music. 
well
We've been working together since, well, since we were kids, really. 
well
Well, unlike a normal album, we haven't been able to accommodate this request. 
well
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version, we just can't make that happen, and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. 
 just 
But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music, is really just one idea. 
 just 
Of not just creating economic value but creating social value. 
 just 
And the model of 4G is quite simple: Companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders in what's happening around in society. 
 just 
And that model is all about doing well and doing good. 
well
You know, I thought it was rather facetious. 
you know
I don't know how many of you know that five million children don't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap. 
you know
A product that we've just launched recently, One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes. 
 just 
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent. 
by the way
So just think about it. 
 just 
I don't know how many of you know that palm oil, and not buying it from sustainable sources, can create deforestation that is responsible for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world. 
you know
But just like any other technology, vaccines have their shortcomings, and the needle and syringe this old technology. 
 just 
And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well. 
well
To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp, but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye. 
you see
We've talked about it being needle-free -- these are projections that you can't even see -- and, of course, we get around the needle phobia issue as well. 
well
So it does that well. 
well
As one example, in the brown layer there's a certain type of cell called a Langerhans cell -- every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells, those immune cells, and there's others shown as well that we haven't stained in this image. 
well
We target thousands upon thousands of these particular cells just residing within a hair's width of the surface of the skin. 
 just 
But there's another angle to this as well -- you can take vaccines that currently don't work and get them over that line and get them protective. 
well
If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down, but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well. 
well
 We're delighted about it as well. 
well
And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting. 
well
And I talked to a bunch of people about, should I give a speech at TEDWomen about women, and they said, oh no, no. 
 oh 
And I said -- very last minute -- you know, you really should share that story. 
you know
And Pat's a friend, and so, not related to the speech I was planning on giving, which was chock full of facts and figures, and nothing personal, I told Pat the story. I said, well, I'm having a hard day. 
well
And you said yes, because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles, you have to be honest about how hard it is. 
to be honest
SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was -- you know, I never really expected to write a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer, and it was viewed a lot, and it really started impacting people's lives. 
you know
So he could call evenly on men and women. And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better, and he was able to go back to them and tell them that. 
well
And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice. 
i guess
To launch not just a book, not just a best-selling, best-viewed talk, but a movement, where people began to literally describe their actions at work as, I'm leaning in. 
 just 
SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, I'm happy, and it's the very beginning. 
i mean
 There's always a few, it runs about five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen. 
okay
It's just that we judge them through a different lens, and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead, are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss, and in a woman, she's bossy. 
 just 
I mean, let's just put it out there, face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors, and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions. 
 just 
Have you seen changes? 
you see
SS: Well, there's certainly more dialogue, which is great. 
well
And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all.  At all. I mean, the women should be paid as much as the men. 
i mean
You know, 500 times roughly 10. 
you know
And I kind of just started crying. 
 just 
Because I think when the book first came out, many people thought, well, this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up. 
well
And you know what we found? 
you know
Do you know when the last time those numbers went up? 
you know
So, it was just before the time that the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York, to see my new domain. 
 just 
Well, so much gold, so vulgar. 
well
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly. 
you know
I mean, it's a color that I can't think of anything that you actually see in nature, that looks that shade. 
i mean
It was a Dumbo nightmare.  But something more profound was happening as well. 
well
I and my colleagues had always thought that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of, you know -- no wonder there was a revolution. 
you know
And as I did so, I started thinking: Well, what are we actually looking at here? 
well
And then remember, not just one, but two. 
 just 
Well actually, the end of the trunks were originally candle holders. 
well
Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' -- which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object -- actually comes from the same root as the word 'fantasy.' And that what this object was just as much in a way, in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting, is a portal to somewhere else. 
 just 
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war, having just finished the washing up.  He seems also to have forgotten his sword. 
 just 
I mean, look at them -- at the end of this movie, you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture. 
i mean
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop -- and I'm actually redesigning the robot, so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me. 
you see
And it's the same structure, just the motion is different. 
 just 
Actor: "You want to know something? Well, you want to know something? 
well
 But, moving in a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human-robot interaction. 
 just 
We didn't have to communicate verbally about this -- it all just happened. 
 just 
But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player, and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. 
 just 
We use our bodies to think; we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move, but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. 
 just 
Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. 
 just 
And in a way, I thought, maybe it's time -- just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century, from going from the very calculated, planned way of behaving, to a more intuitive, risk-taking, embodied way of behaving -- maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution. 
 just 
And I thought, music: that's the perfect place to look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation -- and we just got this robot playing marimba. 
 just 
So, this is what musicians called a call-and-response interaction, and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence. 
well
And so I tried to do the same things, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play, it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play, and does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me. 
 just 
  Being a musician is not just about making notes, otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show. 
 just 
The head doesn’t actually touch the marimba, it just expresses what the music is like. 
 just 
I think.  And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like, but especially what a robotic musician would move like, to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment. 
 just 
So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision, in the corner of his eye, it's very powerful. 
 just 
And I thought, what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you, but would actually enjoy it, too? 
 just 
And it's not just fun and games. 
 just 
"You know, I am a virgin," she told me. 
you know
Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard over the years, traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. 
 just 
You know, as for that third red line, that off-limits subject, what do you think it might be? 
you know
This is just one face of a booming sex trade across the Arab region. 
 just 
The Encyclopedia is just one in a long line of Arabic erotica, much of it written by religious scholars. 
 just 
Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad, there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex: not just its problems, but also its pleasures, and not just for men, but also for women. 
 just 
It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee, which was really warm milk with just a touch of caffeine. 
 just 
And my father, who worked at night, would spend every afternoon with her, just to make sure she ate. 
 just 
We are just not doing enough. 
 just 
She went back to her life and, fortunately, today she is doing well. 
well
This led them to ask the question: Well, why? 
well
The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization. 
 just 
You know, you could call it cooperation, basically. 
you know
You know, the repairability issue is a cooperation problem. 
you know
There are many second TVs at work that don't create value, they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency. 
 just 
I've always had stage fright, and not just a little bit, it's a big bit. 
 just 
But after a couple of years, just writing songs wasn't enough. 
 just 
Well, when I got there, it was packed. 
well
Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn, when my whole body rebelled, and this wave of anxiety just washed over me. 
 just 
 I mean, your nervous system is an idiot. 
i mean
 So then it was my turn, and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato -- you know, when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out. 
you know
And this is not the good kind of vibrato, like an opera singer has, this is my whole body just convulsing with fear. 
 just 
And I remember it really well, because I don't have a lot of epiphanies.  All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness. 
well
And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. 
 just 
Except for when I was really nervous, like now.  Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you? 
okay
♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫ ♫ this stage fright is real. ♫ ♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫ ♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫ ♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫ ♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫ ♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫ ♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫ ♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫ 
well
♫ And you tell me, don't worry so much, you'll be great. ♫ ♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫ ♫ and I know how I get. ♫ ♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫ ♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫ ♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't help me when I sing. ♫ ♫ But we shouldn't talk about these things right now, ♫ ♫ really, I'm up on stage, and you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫ 
 just 
♫ And I'm not making fun of unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫ ♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫ ♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫ ♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫ ♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫ ♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫ ♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫ ♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫ 
 just 
You know, from healthcare to transportation, everything is different, but education hasn't changed. 
you know
So what you see here is not a rock concert. 
you see
And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. 
you see
Now these large numbers are just one part of the story. 
 just 
&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot; So we had a real issue with communicating, and we were just not communicating, until one day I had this epiphany. 
 just 
She must have thought, you know, some friend of hers was calling her. 
you know
It's just been absolutely great. 
 just 
In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs, I can't text very well -- but I'm willing to bet that with evolution, our kids and their grandchildren will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs to text much better, that evolution will fix all of that stuff. 
well
Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom, and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises, where the learners in the high school, 15-year-olds, mind you, would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class, and as you see from this image here, they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work. 
you see
Now don't take these results to the bank just yet. 
 just 
I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students? 
i mean
They get the instant feedback, and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX. 
you see
In fact, one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year, he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year, and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark: &amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&amp;quot; When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework? 
 just 
You know, all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on. 
well
You know, they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it. 
you know
I told my TAs, okay, 24/7, we're going to be up monitoring the forum, answering questions. 
okay
So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night, and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan, and he asked a question, and I said, okay, let me go and type up an answer, I don't type all that fast, and I begin typing up the answer, and before I can finish, another student from Egypt popped in with an answer, not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer, 
okay
Now this is all not just in the future. 
 just 
Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and, you know, you didn't even have a rewind button? 
you know
It turned out that we were doing a lot of low-level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in Trenton. 
 just 
Now, moneyball, as many of you know, is what the Oakland A's did, where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games, and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience, the scouts' instincts and experience, to pick players, from one to use 
you know
They're just waiting for their day in court. 
 just 
At the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score, six of course being the highest, and then in the middle you see, "Elevated risk of violence." 
you see
And then, towards the bottom, you see the Failure to Appear Score, which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court. 
you see
We're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well, to try to take a system that runs today in America the same way it did 50 years ago, based on instinct and experience, and make it into one that runs on data and analytics. 
well
The great news for us as well is that it's the way that we can transform the American criminal justice system. 
well
I mean, we all had those when we were little. 
i mean
I want to let you know it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me, because I faced a lot of obstacles. 
you know
From user name Liquidsore29 -- interesting user names we have here— &amp;quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&amp;quot; Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay. 
okay
From Jeffrey Gutierrez: &amp;quot;OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.&amp;quot; So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, people don't care, people think it's a waste of time, and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family. 
 just 
So let your haters hate, you know what, and make your change, because I know you can. 
you know
Well, complex is not complicated. 
well
Okay? So that's what this picture looks like. 
okay
What the model told us is that, in a nutshell, each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends, and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them. 
 just 
I'm sure you know meerkats. 
you know
between the dominant female, here in red, and the other individuals, is that for her, the height of the obstacle, which is in fact the risk perceived from the road, is just slightly higher, in the individual's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe, that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first. 
 just 
Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks. 
okay
DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about -- the bats, meerkats -- and humans. 
okay
But is it okay to do these associations? 
okay
NP: Well, I would say there are also counter-examples to these stereotypes. 
well
DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start. 
okay
There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer? 
 just 
But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. 
 just 
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah! 
 just 
And you know what else we did? 
you know
We had bake sales, we had car washes, and we did everything we could do to fundraise, and then at one point we said, you know, it's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people's lives. 
you know
Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation? 
you know
And you know what else it did? It collected data. 
you know
Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so— Man: What is this? Pizza. Woman: If you had just called me, I would have known— Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza? Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud. 
well
And let me just put this in context. 
 just 
But he said, "Do you know what they do do? 
you know
We just do. We have to.  We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. 
 just 
I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. 
i mean
And today, there's a handful of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery During this period, launching things into space, just the rocket to get the satellite up there, has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do, you cram as much functionality in there as possible. 
 just 
I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally, but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected, some friends and I put together a dataset of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between 2000 and 2010. 
 just 
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites, but fortunately we had help. 
 just 
it just seemed boring to go work on anything else. 
 just 
The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing. 
 just 
Although this was the low-cost option, quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable. 
 just 
So about three or four weeks later, we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed, and they told us that back in the 1970s, the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff -- that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution, being able to see objects one meter in size, they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images, 
 just 
Now people use these because they get a lot of light, which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image. 
you see
And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well, and day by day, our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units. 
well
Well, it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency, and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come. 
well
For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid, it just doesn't get much better than that. 
 just 
And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana-San Diego border region, which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect. 
i mean
What do I mean by the informal in this case? 
i mean
I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization. 
 just 
I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness, that informality here, the informal, is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists, that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs. 
 just 
See here, buildings are not important just for their looks, but, in fact, they are important for what they can do. 
 just 
And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids -- with the small programs, social and economic. 
i mean
So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space, such as &amp;quot;the informal Buddha,&amp;quot; which tells the story of a small house that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico, but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple, and in so doing, this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood. 
well
So I'm just going to take you to a video. 
 just 
The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall, but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper, that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood. 
you see
So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel. 
 just 
You see the two movements integrated, and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation. 
you see
So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands. 
you see
Okay, this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners. 
okay
So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement. 
you see
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah.   I mean, I love all kinds of rhythm. 
 oh 
Well, look, think of it this way. 
well
CC: Okay, now you feel that? 
okay
On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928, May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city, and there at the Wellmeadow Café, she had a Scots ice cream float, a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend. 
well
They're not just less politically engaged. 
 just 
As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well-honed professional skills. 
well
Democracy, well-led and well-informed, can achieve very great things, but there's a precondition. 
well
Well, by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability. 
well
By the way, there's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease. 
by the way
"Pick-up" is to pick someone up, but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks. 
 just 
Well, by becoming aware of my uselessness. 
well
It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up, just like that, at the slightest underachievement. 
 just 
Okay, let's think of why. 
okay
You see, what happens is, when we need to make complex choices, us humans like really simple solutions, and so we often ask for simple solutions. 
you see
I advise designers and innovators around sustainability, and everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla, I just want the eco-materials." 
 just 
And I say, "Well, that's very complex, and we'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco-material means, because everything at some point comes from nature, and it's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact. 
well
And you see, the choices that we make as an individual, but the choices that we make in every single job that we have, no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order, has an impact on all of these systems. 
you see
You see, there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power, displacing the need for fossil fuel power, but we need to be smart about this. 
you see
But if you're throwing it in the bin, and your local landfill facility is just a normal one, then we're having what's called a double negative. 
 just 
I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years, all right? 
i mean
And as I was just explaining, food waste is a problem. 
 just 
And I blame it on the refrigerator, well, especially in Western cultures, because it makes it easier. 
well
I mean, there's a lot of complex systems going on here. 
i mean
Okay? So this is a problem, people. 
okay
Okay. You need a tight environment. 
okay
But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer with a slightly better seal. 
 just 
Don't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that. 
 just 
Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system, not only do we have that impact I just explained at the end of life, but we actually have had to grow that lettuce. 
 just 
And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm or a designer, and they were designing one of these, and they wanted to do it eco, they'd usually ask me two things. 
i mean
Well I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems." 
well
Now, I looked at a number of kettles available on the market, and found the minimum fill lines, so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there, was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water just to make one cup of tea. 
 just 
Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore? 
you know
So we need to find smarter, more systems-based, innovative solutions to these problems, So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone, your new one because you replaced your old one -- after 15 to 18 months is the average time that people replace their phones, by the way — so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing, then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems. 
by the way
But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter, as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions, because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products, they're participating in these major problems. 
 just 
If you just had paper or plastic -- obviously reusable is far more beneficial -- then the paper is worse, and the paper is worse because it weighs four to 10 times more than the plastic, and when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective, a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper, the paper is far better, but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not done with a kilo of each material. 
 just 
And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who I work with, a senior designer. 
 just 
I said, "How come you're not doing sustainability? I know you know this." 
you know
And he said, "Well, recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client, and turned and he said to me, 'I know it's going to cost less, I know it's going to sell more, but we're not pioneers, because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'" I think we've got a roomful of pioneers, and I hope there are far more pioneers out there, because we need to solve these problems. 
well
And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things, like environmental and social issues and corporate governance. 
i mean
We have a population that's both growing and aging; we have seven billion souls today heading to 10 billion at the end of the century; we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished; and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing. 
 just 
We know that investors, when they look at a company and decide whether to invest, they look at financial data, metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share, valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff. 
you know
Environment includes energy consumption, water availability, waste and pollution, just making efficient uses of resources. 
 just 
Social includes human capital, things like employee engagement and innovation capacity, as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights. 
well
Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are. 
well
They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success. 
 just 
Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans, there's more growth in water than in power tools, and this company has their sights set on what they call "the new New World." 
well
Now, you may be asking yourself, are these just isolated cases? 
 just 
I mean, come on, really? 
i mean
Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially? 
well
The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others. 
well
So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more. 
okay
Well, some are, and a few are really at the vanguard. 
well
The one that just really gets under my skin is, "If you want to do something about that, just make money, give the profits to charities." 
 just 
I mean, let me clarify something right here. 
i mean
I mean, a really lot of it. 
i mean
Well, President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on: "There are risks and costs to a program of action, but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction." 
well
Well, maybe not if you live in Boston.  But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen, right? 
well
 Stephen Hawking: "I would have thought it was fairly obvious what I meant." 
i mean
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it, I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay? 
okay
Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this. 
 just 
Well, giving your voice can change lives. 
well
If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty, you get a sense of the ambition. 
 just 
Well, I work in financial markets, not development. 
well
Well, this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in. 
well
So think of this: Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years, I was able to double my contribution. 
 just 
So following that conversation with my daughter, and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money-printing, and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time, this made me wonder: Could we match but just on a much grander scale? 
 just 
Well, this involves the creation of money to buy goods, not assets. 
well
So what we're saying here is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble to save our financial systems, and you know what, it paid off. 
you know
Even though this is the printing of just three central banks, the global aid that's given over this period is up by almost 40 percent. 
 just 
But you know what, that's the point of a matching scheme. 
you know
They see around corners, shaping their future, not just reacting to it. 
 just 
You know, we hear often about good ol' boy networks and they're certainly alive and well in many institutions. 
well
They don't just talk about risk-taking, they actually do it. 
 just 
And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid. 
 just 
Okay. Pretty much everybody. 
okay
 So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. 
okay
We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- So we're extremely closely related to them, and as you'll see in terms of our behavior, we've got some relationship as well. 
well
So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved, until agriculture, as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex, flexible social systems, networks, that our ancestors were very good at, and that's why our species has survived so well. 
well
I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. 
 just 
You can choose to be a vegetarian, but don't think that just because you've made that decision, bacon suddenly stops smelling good. 
 just 
Okay? So this is my point. 
okay
All right? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates, including chimps and bonobos, because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. 
well
Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this, but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. 
well
Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent, roughly, of their menstrual cycle, bonobos 90 percent, and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle, whether she's menstruating, whether she's post-menopausal, whether she's already pregnant. 
well
Now, Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day, as scientists tend to do sometimes. 
well
The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men's sperm or just their own. 
 just 
 And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo all have external testicles, which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. 
 just 
It goes into anthropology as well. 
well
CR: Well first of all, the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. 
well
But that's just an example. 
 just 
Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me, just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that way now, and I agree with that. 
you know
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system, and it is a deeply democratic activity. 
 just 
It's the idea that if you see a problem, you work to fix it, and not just complain about it. 
you see
You just have to believe that you can bring a 21st-century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. 
 just 
Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. 
 just 
So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. 
 just 
And so what you see in all three of these places, in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City, are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. 
you see
And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described, and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. 
 just 
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. 
you see
And when you get to language, you see that it becomes a word whose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds, has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with, or what it represents, which is the bowl of soup. 
you see
There are thousands of children using this, you know, all over the world, and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do. 
you know
Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. 
 just 
So I was very excited by this, you know, hopping around all over the place, trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. 
you know
I mean, we have these rich, complicated, multi-dimensional ideas. 
i mean
I mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea, especially for India. 
i mean
So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. 
you see
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. 
well
It's just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get. 
 just 
Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. 
okay
Well, how do we do this? 
well
They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. 
you see
Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. 
okay
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. 
well
Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. 
well
I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? 
i mean
Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. 
well
Well, if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them, obviously I would have called you crazy. 
well
Well, ratings affect you. 
well
Well, then the country has less available for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare. 
well
The second point, would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer? 
 just 
I think there is no doubt that the sector not just a trimming at the margins. 
 just 
Well, a country has many gardeners, and one of them is the government, so we have to ask the question, how is a country governed? 
well
Well, our friends at Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well. 
well
Gamma is just one of these companies. 
 just 
Really, they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air-conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. 
 just 
You know, your webcam light won't turn on. 
you know
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. 
 just 
The video they've produced is very sexy, and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. 
 just 
So as I said before, governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off-the-shelf surveillance software, and so for that reason, you see that the government of, say, Tunisia, might use the same software as the government of Germany. 
you see
And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on. 
 just 
What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope. 
you see
What you do is, you take it on, and just like you are playing like a toy, which it is, I tab it off, and I break it off. 
 just 
When it's done, it looks something like this, has all the functionalities of a standard microscope, just like an XY stage, a place where a sample slide could go, for example right here. 
 just 
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn -- go to the back of the wall -- and just project, and this way you will see exactly what I would see. 
 just 
So it turns out they're waterproof, and --  — right here is just fluorescent water, and I don't know if you can actually see this. 
 just 
I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets. 
 just 
I instantly joined Genspace after this, and I asked Oliver, "Well, if we can do this strawberries, can we do this with people as well?" 
well
And I started having these bizarre dinner parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions, and I would actually capture them on video, because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. 
well
They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. 
 just 
is currently in a couple galleries in New York, and it's selling out pretty well, actually. 
well
This was my moment to lean in, to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs, and I had just finished a big, 18-month project for Secretary Clinton, successfully, and I knew I could handle a bigger job. 
 just 
But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey, where my husband and my two teenage sons lived, and it was not going well. 
well
I suggest that real equality, full equality, does not just mean valuing women on male terms. 
 just 
In the workplace, real equality means valuing family just as much as work, and understanding that the two reinforce each other. 
 just 
Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day. 
 just 
It's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch. 
 just 
In policy terms, real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done, no matter who does it. 
 just 
Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need, and many of those workers are scrambling. 
 just 
They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can, and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. 
well
It turns out that "you don't care" is just as much a part of who we are as "that's not fair." 
 just 
By the way, you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this. 
by the way
Well, this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana, and what you do is you take medication, something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on, and you scratch off the code, and you send that to an SMS number, and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it's expired. 
well
In Kenya, there's a service called iCow, which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy. 
 just 
We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did. 
 just 
Well, of course it's happening at the edge, because in the middle, everybody's updating Facebook, or worse still, they're trying to understand Facebook's privacy settings. 
well
Well, I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. 
well
But of course, that doesn't exactly happen, and that's because we can't just take form into account. 
 just 
We have to think about function as well, and when it comes to sex, function relates to the contributions made by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs. 
well
I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male, or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough, then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things: avoiding predators, taking care of offspring, gathering and ingesting food. 
i mean
Well, according to the biological literature, "During copulation, the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract." 
well
These are Mexican guppies, and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments, and these filaments basically form a fish mustache, if you will. 
you see
I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis. 
i mean
Well, sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. 
well
And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs. 
i suppose
The prison warden, looking equally indifferent, said, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer, and we'll be around as soon as we can." 
 just 
These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood. 
 just 
We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have, but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood. 
 just 
Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy, but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates. 
well
Finally, I believe we need to change our own amygdalae, because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is, but who we are. 
 just 
Well, it shows you that -- I also deal with issues where there's not certainty of whether it's a girl or a boy, so the mixed answer was very appropriate. 
well
And by that I mean, made by a description of your genitals. 
i mean
Nor do they define your gender, which, as different from your anatomic sex, describes your self-concept: Do you see yourself as a male or female, or somewhere in the spectrum in between? 
you see
And I saw someone age 24, genetically female, went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story, a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name, and came to me after graduating, saying, "Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology." 
you know
And then I got really confused, because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming. 
 just 
If you just think of the following, you'll get it right: Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with. 
 just 
You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young. 
 just 
So I looked at how the patients were doing, and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else, except they were pubertally delayed. 
 just 
Well, where were these kids before? 
well
And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age 16, which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened, even if they tested them well. 
well
And yet, she had just begun a male puberty. 
 just 
Well, I did something a little bit innovative, because I do know hormones, and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses, the growth plates, and stopping growth, than testosterone is. 
well
And she was offered contracts as a model, at which point she teased me, when she said, "You know, I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one." 
you know
Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here, and Jonas is just going -- biologic control. 
 just 
Well, we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination. 
well
["Rebecca Newberger Goldstein"] ["Steven Pinker"] ["The Long Reach of Reason"] Cabbie: Twenty-two dollars. Steven Pinker: Okay. 
okay
People who think too well are often accused of elitism, and even in the academy, there are attacks on logocentrism, the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking. 
well
After all, you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end, and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. 
 just 
You need two conditions: The first is that reasoners all care about their own well-being. 
well
We all care passionately about our own well-being. 
well
The second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another's well-being, can exchange messages, and comprehend each other's reasoning. 
well
And that's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species, well endowed with the instinct for language. 
well
SP: Well, that sounds good in theory, but has it worked that way in practice? 
well
SP: Well, among other things, our circle of empathy expanded. 
well
Books on empathy have become bestsellers, like "The Empathic Civilization" RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't? 
i mean
RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels: reason. 
well
Don't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in? 
 just 
RNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us: Contradictions bother us, at least when we're forced to confront them, which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason. 
 just 
By now, these things just feel wrong. 
 just 
But just those arguments had to be made, and they were, in centuries past. 
 just 
RNG: And if, our friends, you detect a flaw in this argument, just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out. 
 just 
Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority, I don't think they knew where it might lead. 
well
You see, since the age of about five I've always asked the question, but why? 
you see
Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations, like in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. 
well
Well, that uses anonymous companies too. 
well
Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars, and not being able to find out who you were really up against. 
 just 
There are just so many examples, the horesemeat scandal in Europe, the Italian mafia, they've used these companies The $100 million American Medicare fraud, the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '90s. 
 just 
And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible for outrageous crimes, for stealing from you and me and millions of others, they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease, and they're doing it using legal structures. 
 just 
Well, the answer is, yes you can. 
well
Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up. 
well
Do you know, in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card, like Delaware, which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company. 
you know
Okay, so let's say it's America, and let's say it's Delaware, and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider. 
okay
Well, that's no problem either. 
well
There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way. 
okay
Well, an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently. 
well
But this was an awful tragedy, and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths. 
 just 
Well, imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company. 
well
Well, there is only one way. 
well
And yes, this is ambitious, but there is momentum on this issue, and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum, and it's just starting on this issue. 
 just 
And just last week, the European Parliament came on board with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries. 
 just 
And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians, because without that, real far-reaching, world-shifting change just isn't going to happen. 
 just 
Because this isn't just about changing the law, this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do, and in what ways is it acceptable to use company structures. 
 just 
Let's just do it, let's end anonymous companies. 
 just 
I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me, it was just an obvious thing -- I want to somehow turn myself into that. 
 just 
And you see, because of the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year. 
you see
I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes, so I kept working. 
well
So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually, the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes "goosh" into your other eye, and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. 
 just 
And how do you know? 
you know
But then you could say, well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not? 
well
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders and there's one -- one -- that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting. 
 just 
Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure it's not a black widow spider, and then walk into it. 
well
And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. 
you see
It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal. 
 just 
And we don't just practice things going right, we practice things going wrong all the time, so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs. 
 just 
And not just underwater, but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic. 
 just 
So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk, it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. 
 just 
Instead you kind of look around and go, "Okay, I can't see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me. 
okay
We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside, Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes, and it turned out it was just the anti-fog, sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye. 
 just 
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. 
 just 
You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. 
you see
But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth --  -- instead, 20 years previously we had started studying Russian, and then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian, and then we learned vehicle control theory, and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. 
 just 
CH: And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end, but you're ready for it you're in a custom-built seat, you know how the shock absorber works. 
you know
And all being well, welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED. 
well
They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters, brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives, all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally, and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. 
 just 
I mean, in that circumstance, couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable? 
i mean
I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA in order to get the type of access that you've spoken of. 
i mean
RL: So there are, when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before, use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology, and they do, because it's a great system, it's the most complex system ever devised by man, and it is a wonder, and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that, and it's just a wonderful thing. 
 just 
That would be awesome, and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. 
 just 
RL: It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position, as are we, because the companies, we compel them to provide information, just like every other nation in the world does. 
 just 
In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business, and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out, that says, when you find that, not if you find it, when you find it, because you're certain to find it, here's how you protect that. 
 just 
CA: Okay, so a couple of things here, because this is really the core of this, almost. 
okay
I mean, first of all, a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. 
i mean
I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. 
i guess
RL: Well, I'd say two things. 
well
You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was 54, 25 of those in Europe, and of those 25, 18 of them occurred in three countries, some of which are our allies, and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs, by the way. 
by the way
CA: It's also been said that, of those 54 alleged incidents, that as few as zero of them with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed, that it was basically through other forms of intelligence, that you're looking for a needle in a haystack, and the effects of these programs, these controversial programs, is just to add hay to the stack, not to really find the needle. 
 just 
We're actually starting well before that, hopefully before there are any bodies, and we're trying to build the case for who the people are, what they're trying to do, and that involves massive amounts of information. 
well
Do you see, has that kind of possibility been entertained at all? 
you see
This is a really important conversation, and it impacts, it's not just NSA, it's not just the government, it's you, it's the Internet companies. 
 just 
The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government, and so learn the facts. 
 just 
I've just alienated half the audience, I know. 
 just 
The shrimp are just one step on its journey. 
 just 
When you write about parasites, your lexicon swells with phrases like "devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body." 
well
See what I mean? 
i mean
 We have a lot to get through. I only have 13 minutes.  Now, some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world, that they are outliers, and that point of view is understandable, because by their nature, parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. 
 just 
And once there, she lays an egg on it, egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body, yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. 
you know
It's more of an extension of the wasp, just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm. 
 just 
Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind-controlling supervillains -- these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction, but in nature, they happen all the time. 
well
But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking. 
 just 
And there was something about this place, I didn't know why, that just felt special. 
 just 
No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome. 
 just 
And I said, "No, I mean, the roof." 
i mean
You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long-past war. 
you see
I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza, we visited those the year before, and sure they're impressive, nice enough design, but look, give me an unlimited budget, 20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside, and I'll build you pyramids too. 
i mean
By miracles, I mean things that are technically barely possible, very high-risk, and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time, certainly not by you. 
i mean
Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one, and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either. 
well
However, just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon, new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure. 
 just 
Besides, once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant, and it's okay to keep driving, every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on. 
okay
Five miracles, mostly delivered, and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. 
 just 
In conclusion, I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us, just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge, multidisciplinary skills, and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. 
 just 
We need to help them to find their own role models, and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible, and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus, and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums, we need to encourage them to find their own path, even if it's very different from our own. 
 just 
And it's also become a much more interactive place, where people are interacting with others, they're commenting, they're sharing, they're not just reading. 
 just 
I didn't just put that logo on this poor, pregnant woman's belly. 
 just 
It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they call a pregnancy score, which is not just whether or not a woman's pregnant, but what her due date is. 
 just 
So in my lab and with colleagues, we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference, your personality score, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, intelligence, along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are. 
you know
We can do all of this really well. 
well
And they looked at just people's Facebook likes, so just the things you like on Facebook, and used that to predict all these attributes, along with some other ones. 
 just 
So if you're smart, you tend to be friends with smart people, and if you're young, you tend to be friends with young people, and this is well established for hundreds of years. 
well
How do you know that you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked? 
you know
An example I often give is that, if I ever get bored being a professor, I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user, if you're an alcoholic. 
well
We could go the policy route, where social media companies say, you know what? You own your data. 
you know
And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user, "Here's the risk of that action you just took." 
 just 
By liking that Facebook page, or by sharing this piece of personal information, you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. 
well
And that, I think, can affect whether or not people want to share something, keep it private, or just keep it offline altogether. 
 just 
One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is, they say, you know, if people start keeping all this data private, all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail. 
you know
You might even think it'd be easy, given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. 
 just 
You know what else makes my role particularly challenging? 
you know
Now, I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes, so I knew that "yo, bitch" was also often a common greeting between friends, as well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference. 
well
 So okay, determining whether or not something is abusive without context, definitely hard. 
okay
We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. 
 just 
Okay. Let's make the stakes higher. 
okay
Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non-violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening. 
well
And that's not just an issue for me, or for Twitter, it's an issue for you. 
 just 
What do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?" 
i mean
Well, here's one possibility. 
well
There's more in that picture than just a cat. 
 just 
It's just that for those of us dealing with scale, for those of us tasked with keeping people safe, we have to assume the worst will happen, because for us, a one-in-a-million chance is pretty good odds. 
 just 
 So when I was feeling bad about myself, insecure, I would jack my height up.  But when I was feeling confident and suave, I would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance. 
 just 
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle, to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation. 
 just 
 Lisa Mallette: Oh my God. 
 oh 
LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it! 
 oh 
LM: It's just like I've got a real leg! 
 just 
Man: Now turn around, and do the same thing walking up, but get on your heel to toe, like you would normally just walk on level ground. 
 just 
LM: Oh my God. 
 oh 
 It's not well appreciated, but over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive, emotional, sensory or motor condition, and because of poor technology, too often, conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. 
well
It's just about 20 years ago, June 1994, when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip. 
 just 
People marched to demand -- okay, not really exactly like that — but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. 
okay
So can you see the pattern? 
you see
Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it? Number two. 
you see
It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk. 
 just 
And I said to him, "You know, Aaron, it's not my field, not my field." 
you know
Now if you know Aaron Swartz, you know that we lost him just over a year ago. 
you know
I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us wish we could fly like Superman, but because at least 91 percent of us believe we can't, we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge. 
i mean
Well, we started with this march with 200 people, and next year, there will be 1,000 on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause, and then in 2016, before the primary, there will be 10,000 who march across that state, meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. 
well
Number two, on this march, one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino, was with us, and he said, "Well what can we do?" 
well
Okay, all right, great. Thanks. 
okay
DH: ♪ I'll never remember all this. ♪ ♪ Will the clicker work when I press it? ♪ ♪ Why must Al Gore go right before me? ♪ ♪ Oh man, I'm scared to death. ♪ ♪ I hope I don't pass out onstage ♪ ♪ and now I really wish I wasn't wearing green. ♪ All: ♪ Give your talk. ♪ SC 1: ♪ You must be be sweet like Brené Brown. ♪ 
 oh 
If you look deep into the night sky, you see stars, and if you look further, you see more stars, and further, galaxies, and further, more galaxies. 
you see
But if you keep looking further and further, eventually you see nothing for a long while, and then finally you see a faint, fading afterglow, and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. 
you see
Now, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me. 
i mean
Over here, it's a little hotter, and over there, it's a little cooler, and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room, because where it was a little hotter, there was a little more stuff, and where there was a little more stuff, we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. 
you see
And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing, though that is awesome. 
 just 
But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff. 
 just 
And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society, but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about, well, what might we do and how might we go about it? 
well
Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life where we'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back. 
well
MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world, and we kept saying to ourselves, "Well that can't be. 
well
BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes, whatever the biggest inequity was globally, and there we looked at children dying, children not having enough nutrition to ever develop, and countries that were really stuck, because with that level of death, and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth, and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn't be educated and lift themselves up. 
well
Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports, and this is what the team came to me with, which is, to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than 200 days a year explains why women were saying to me, "I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it, and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there." 
well
We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives, even the contraceptives we have here in the United States, and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country, and to me that was just a crime, and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage, and I finally realized I just had to do it. 
 just 
And even though I'm Catholic, I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives, and I shouldn't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back. 
 just 
BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it. 
well
The last decade, that number has dropped faster than ever in history, and so I just love the fact that you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines, we can get them out there, use the very latest understanding of these things, and get the delivery right, that we can perform a miracle. 
 just 
CA: I mean, you do the math on this, and it works out, I think, literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year. 
i mean
It's incredible how people think, okay, that could be me, and the money flows. 
okay
Now that the Millennium Development Goals and various things are getting out there, we are seeing some increased generosity, so the goal is to get this well below a million, which should be possible in our lifetime. 
well
CA: Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big, sad face to get engaged. 
 just 
I mean, you've used it in your letter this year, you used basically this argument to say that aid, contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken, that actually it has been effective. 
i mean
BG: Yeah, well people can take, there is some aid that was well-meaning and didn't go well. 
well
There's some venture capital investments that were well-meaning and didn't go well. 
well
You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that, because we don't have a perfect record, this is a bad endeavor. 
 just 
How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves, and say wow, this is going well, and be smarter. 
well
That just wouldn't work out." 
 just 
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't -- this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey, and we don't travel together as much for the foundation, actually, as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. 
you know
Six years ago, I guess, Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft and became full time. 
i guess
I mean, Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in 2006, and it was really his decision, but again, it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. 
i mean
I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger, and now Melinda, and in even stronger, equal ways, is the partner, so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to, which groups are working well? 
well
MG: Well, here's the thing. 
well
We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you're going to have different failures. 
you know
Well, we got hundreds of ideas. 
well
We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis, that I thought, once I got this drug, we can just go wipe out the disease. 
 just 
Well, turns out it took an injection every day for 10 days. 
well
MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer, and small schools definitely help. 
well
And just taken about three weeks ago, I think, three or four weeks ago. Where was this? 
 just 
And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound, and so let me just give you one explanation of that. 
 just 
MG: And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son, who had passed his secondary exams, because of her chores, she'd not done so well and wasn't in the government school yet. 
well
CA: I mean, this is another pic of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe, along with Paul Farmer. 
i mean
BG: Well, I'd say overall the kids get a great education, but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do, and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them -- most of the money's going to the foundation -- and help them find something they're excited about. 
well
MG: Well, it's interesting. 
well
As they get older, they so know that our family belief is about responsibility, that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education, and we have a responsibility to give back to the world. 
 just 
And so as they get older and we are teaching them -- they have been to so many countries around the world — they're saying, we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing, Mom and Dad, and it is okay to show us more. 
okay
CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett, something really amazing happened in 2006, when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America 80 percent of his fortune to your foundation. 
well
I guess there's a long version and a short version of that. 
i guess
BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend, and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away. Tragically, she passed away before he did, and he's big on delegation, and —  — he said — CA: Tweet that. 
well
BG: If he's got somebody who is doing something well, and is willing to do it at no charge, maybe that's okay. But we were stunned. 
well
BG: Well, we've got about 120 people who have now taken this giving pledge. 
well
The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about, okay, do you hire staff, what do you give to them? 
okay
I mean, the beauty of philanthropy is this mind-blowing diversity. 
i mean
Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead. 
 just 
MG: And having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy, I mean, these are people who have created their own businesses, put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas. 
i mean
BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done, and you can't take it with you, and if it's not good for your kids, let's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done. 
well
And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction. 
 just 
BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy, it's good. 
 oh 
In the U.S., we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students. 
 just 
 CA: Well, I really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future. 
well
On the other hand, right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information, information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge. 
 just 
So people will then say, "Well, Chris, you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators. 
well
If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular, these guys will probably cancel each other out, and then we'll be okay." 
okay
The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching, not in any college or university, but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage. 
 just 
Now people oftentimes say, "Well, magic is just magic." 
well
And when they try to describe what that is, they just say, "He has that magic." 
 just 
You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop, you've got to attend that black church, and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do. 
 just 
They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch, you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more. 
 just 
Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully, and first among other things were the comfortable, movable chairs. 
well
So here you see a familiar sight. 
you see
I mean, where would you sit here? 
i mean
So just to make sure, I insisted that we build a mock-up in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall. 
 just 
So you see, details really do make a difference. 
you see
But design is not just how something looks, it's how your body feels on that seat in that space, and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. 
 just 
Well, I didn't have any idea. 
well
Now, you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants, so we were excited about the prospect of growth, but honestly, where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water? 
you know
Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea, ambitious because communities had to approve those plans. 
well
By listening. So I began listening, in fact, thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. 
 just 
You know, communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. 
you know
It's not something you can just fake. 
 just 
I can't tell you how many blocks I walked, in sweltering summers, in freezing winters, year after year, just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. 
 just 
Well, those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important, but rezoning was never my mission. 
well
Here you see what was two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, impossible to get to and impossible to use. 
you see
Well, it's up to you, not as a city planner but as a human being. 
well
I mean, would you want to go there? 
i mean
Can you see into it and out of it? 
you see
Well now, all over New York City, there are places where you can find your very own seat. 
well
You know, it's true, commercial interests will always battle against public space. 
you know
Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers. 
well
Well no, it would not be terrific. 
well
 And you know what, it might mean more money for the city, but a city has to take the long view, the view for the common good. 
you know
Perhaps it was just in their way. 
 just 
So you see, no matter how popular and successful a public space may be, it can never be taken for granted. 
you see
It's not just the number of people using them, it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. 
 just 
At the other extreme, there are things that move too fast for our eyes, but we have technology that can look into that world as well. 
well
And there are unseen creatures living all over your body, including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes, crawling over your skin at night. 
well
We'll just have to see. 
 just 
The reason, I would come to find out, was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. 
well
If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable, you will not use your leg, and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. 
 just 
In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab, one of our patients, a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about 20 years and worn dozens of legs, said of one of our printed parts, "It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows, and it's effing sexy." 
 just 
She just said, "Gabby was shot." 
 just 
A few minutes later, I called her back and I actually thought for a second, well, maybe I just imagined getting this phone call. 
well
MK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury, they typically can't tell you much. 
well
MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious, but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant, in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next, and at that point I knew that she was still in there. 
well
MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning. GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. 
well
MK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby knows what she wants to say, she just can't get it out. 
 just 
She understands everything, but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture, the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head, which is where the bullet passed through. 
 just 
PM: Well, let's take a little closer look at the wife, and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords. 
well
So that's a scooter, but she had -- well, she still has a BMW motorcycle. 
well
PM: Does she ride it? MK: Well, that's a challenge with not being able to move her right arm, but I think with something I know about, Velcro, we might be able to get her back on the bike, Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar. 
well
MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough, it was the last time we were in Vancouver, about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver, at the airport, on a trip that we were both taking to China, that I would actually, from my background, I would call it a boondoggle. 
well
MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona, which was just outside Gabby's state senate district. 
 just 
PM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you. 
well
MK: I guess. 
i guess
GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends. 
 um
PM: Well it was the way you did it. GG: Yes, yes. Fast pace. 
well
 MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often at a colossally slow pace, but my wife, and I have to admit, a lot of other members of Congress that I know, work incredibly hard. 
you know
I mean, Gabby would run around like a crazy person, never take a day off, maybe a half a day off a month, and whenever she was awake she was working, and she really, really thrived on that, and still does today. GG: Yes. Yes. 
i mean
PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark, what that was like, going off onto a mission, one presumes safely, but it's never a guarantee, and knowing that Gabby is — MK: Well not only was she still in the hospital, on the third day of that flight, literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station, and you've got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour, I'm actually flying it, looking out the window, 
well
MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going. 
well
MK: Yeah, we had that vote, I guess about five months after Gabby was injured, and she made this bold decision to go back. 
i guess
GG: Yes. Yes.  MK: You know, this affected us very personally, but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved. 
you know
It was really the 20 murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut, and the response that we saw afterwards where -- well, look what's happened so far. 
well
 MK: You okay? You did great. GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you. 
okay
 MK: Let me just say one of the guys that Gabby jumped with that day was a Navy SEAL who she met in Afghanistan who was injured in combat, had a really rough time. 
 just 
All of these books are well-intentioned. 
well
There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name, "Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957, and in the 50-plus years since, there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. 
 just 
Well, for starters, there has been a major historical change. 
well
So, absent being able to anticipate the future, what we all do, as good parents, is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future, hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off. 
 just 
And you know what? I'm doing okay. 
you know
The writer Michael Lewis once put this very, very well. 
well
Find a guy at home, and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time. 
 just 
Either way, by the way, if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles, just imagine what it's like now for non-traditional families: families with two dads, families with two moms, single-parent households. 
 just 
In this age of intense confusion, there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree, and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones, our kids' happiness is paramount. 
 just 
 Can I just repeat that? 
 just 
Absent having new scripts, we just follow the oldest ones in the book -- decency, a work ethic, love — and let happiness and self-esteem take care of themselves. 
 just 
My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years. 
 just 
Well to see, let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars. 
well
Well, what's going on? 
well
Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth. 
well
Well that would look something like this. 
well
It's like water bending around a rock in a stream, and all that light just destroys the shadow. 
 just 
If we can feather the edges, soften those edges so we can control diffraction, well then we can see a planet, and in the last 10 years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that. 
well
It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before, and we can see the planets beam out just like that. 
 just 
It's going to move in front of the star just like that, creates a wonderful shadow. 
 just 
It's about half the size of the one you just saw. 
 just 
But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it, if, indeed, there was any human agency involved in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether. 
 just 
I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there. 
you see
Well, I tell a lie. 
well
I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible Quickly looking at the arithmetic, I realized I could only actually make three of related design. Here you see them. 
you see
So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions. 
well
I did an analysis of the data, and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets. 
you see
The numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way, they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts. 
by the way
And I said, "Well, you know, the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on." 
well
"Well, thank you for letting me know," I said. 
well
I didn't just throw my design away in a fit of pique. 
 just 
You know, at times of technical innovation, designers want to be influenced by what's in the air. 
you know
You know, engineers are very smart, and despite occasional frustrations because I'm less smart, I've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them. 
you know
So the priorities were just tipping at that point. 
 just 
So I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad, that's more than a stopgap. 
well
Here you see the outline of a letter, the cap H, which is the thin black line, the contour, which is how it is stored in memory, superimposed on the bitmap, which is the grey area, which is how it's displayed on the screen. 
you see
Well, there was no best, so the designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad. 
well
Not to me, if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow, although that standard may be well short of the ideal. 
well
You can maybe see the effect better if it's reduced. Well, maybe not. 
well
But I discovered, by experiment, that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries. 
well
Well, it's been 18 years now since Verdana and Georgia were released. 
well
At the end of the practice, one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star-fished, her head looking up at the sky, trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world. 
 just 
Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though. 
 just 
and he said, "You learn how little you know." 
you know
Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze, who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all, gives silver medalists a focus We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch-off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins 
 just 
It didn't sound like a complaint, exactly, but just a way to let me know, a kind of tender admission, to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious, unfinished path that always required more. 
 just 
When we began this process, we were looking, it was about three years ago, and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia, and by chance, in a previous role, I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. 
 just 
And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us, confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white, or grayscale. 
 just 
And this one's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration, so when you're deeper under the water. 
well
Because we needed to preserve the scientific method, we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the, what we call, SAMS technology rig. 
 just 
And the results were not just exciting, but very encouraging, and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. 
 just 
Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers, and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig, so a black neoprene wetsuit, and going straight to the bottom, coming up and engaging. 
you see
Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention, we've paid attention to the biological evidence, we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence, and we've used science as a tool for translation, translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind. 
well
It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it. 
 just 
And we haven't just built them, though. 
 just 
And not just one, but many. 
 just 
We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites, and we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale. 
 just 
I'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station. 
 just 
 So we didn't just launch two of them like this, we launched 28 of them. 
 just 
It's the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in human history, and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set But that's just the beginning. 
 just 
You see, we're going to launch more than 100 of these satellites like these over the course of the next year. 
you see
Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago, we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now. 
 just 
Water as well. 
well
This is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when the satellite was flying over Argentina. 
 just 
You see, this will be an entirely new global data set. 
you see
Well, I invite you to come and explore with us. 
well
But it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world I was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody, because I knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored "Eat, Pray, Love" were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love," 
well
So I knew that I had no way to win, and knowing that I had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and moving to the country to raise corgis. 
 just 
So just to back up and explain, the only thing I have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer. 
 just 
And it was devastating every single time, and every single time, I had to ask myself if I should just quit while I was behind and give up and spare myself this pain. 
 just 
Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise. 
 just 
And you know what happened with that book? 
you know
And I stayed in my home of writing after that, and I wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received, which is very nice, but not my point. 
 just 
Something worthy, by the way, so addiction and infatuation don't count, because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right? 
by the way
You just do that, and keep doing that again and again and again, and I can absolutely promise you, from long personal experience in every direction, I can assure you that it's all going to be okay. 
 just 
I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects. 
i mean
So here's an example of what I mean. 
i mean
So if we want to tweak the color, we just enter the color mode, and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color, or if we want to adjust the audio, then we get two different dials for that, these physical objects. 
 just 
It's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. 
 just 
So we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment. 
 just 
Well, how genetic is it? 
well
We're starting to have a bottom-up approach where we're identifying those genes, those proteins, those molecules, understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work, understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work, and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior, and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition. 
well
Beyond just drugs, we're going to use educational strategies. 
 just 
All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism, but yet we have a long way to go. 
 just 
As we think about something that's potentially a solution, how well does it work? 
well
Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race, inexorably progressing, but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century. 
 just 
 Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy about performance-enhancing drugs as well, and that's made a difference in some sports at some times, but technology has made a difference in all sports, from faster skis to lighter shoes. 
well
Here you see Michael Phelps, the greatest swimmer in history, standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj, the world record holder in the mile. 
you see
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners. 
 just 
But the more we learn about how that limiter functions, the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit, in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. 
 just 
Now that he has done this, other athletes will follow, just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile. 
 just 
And it costs just 500 dollars. 
 just 
What's more, we've learned that this is something that we haven't built just for the community but with the community. 
 just 
But now, they might just be a text message away from help. 
 just 
Okay, and what we're looking at here, this is Sam's optic nerve, which is a direct extension of her brain, so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there. 
okay
It makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body that would not be possible without access to the eye, and that clip-on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars, and people can be cured of blindness, and I think it says a lot about us as a human race if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them. 
 just 
The patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales, but you can't chop it into one little bit and say, "Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate." 
well
Okay, well if you think about how you can calculate these things, you can take what you can see, okay, I'm going to chop it up into lots of little boxes, and that's the result of physics, right? 
well
We can code each of those very small pieces as well. 
well
And if you ask the models why did that happen, and you say, okay, well, yes, basically it's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. 
well
Or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business-as-usual type of attitude. 
 just 
There's a great phrase that Sherwood Rowland, who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion, when he was accepting his Nobel Prize, he asked this question: "What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if, in the end, all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true?" 
well
But I was totally immersed in this world that was filled with everybody, and then I went on to the United Nations school, and that just completely — So I began sort of developing these voices and these people, all of whom were loosely based on people I really know, and so, for example, in performing them, I would really try to inhabit them. 
 just 
That said, let's just see who comes out. 
 just 
Okay. 
okay
Well first of all, I'll just say that I hope you can hear me okay. 
well
My name is Lorraine Levine, and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain, frankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses. 
 just 
No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them, but at my age, just putting on the regular ones I have already gives me too much information. 
 just 
Okay, next question.  Next, please. 
okay
Hi, um, okay, hi everybody. 
 um
I just want to say first of all that dating is never boring under any circumstance. 
 just 
But I also, I just need to acknowledge that TED is an incredible experience right now in the present, like, I just need to say, like, Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende! 
 just 
Okay, maybe it doesn't mean, of course it means something to you, but to me, it's like, another level, okay? 
okay
Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that I can really, I don't know, I just need to say that. 
 just 
That's incredible to me, and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that, I just need to, like, say some affirmations that can help me. 
 just 
I usually just try to use, like, the three little words that always make me feel better: Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor.  Just, it really helps me to get grounded. 
 just 
Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende, and, you know, I just need to say it, like, it's so incredible to be here, and I knew that we were going to have these questions. 
you know
I was so nervous and I was thinking just, like, oh my God, oh my God, and reminding me, because I've had, like, some very, especially since the last time we were here at TED, it was, like, unbelievable, and then right after that, like, so many crazy things happened, like, we ended up going to the White House to perform. 
 oh 
That was, like, amazing, and I'm standing there, and I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God." 
 just 
And I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God." 
 oh 
And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like, President Obama has to come up here at the same podium, and I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God." 
you know
But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me, you know, as far as I'm concerned, however you reproduce, as long as you're enjoying yourself and it's with another consenting asexual -- I don't know. 
you know
You know where I'm going with that. 
you know
Okay, next question.  What are your top five favorite songs right now? 
okay
All right, well first of all, I'mma say, you know what I'm saying, I'm the only dude up here right now. 
well
My name is Rashid, and I never been at TED before, you know what I'm saying. 
you know
I don't know why. You know what I'm saying. 
you know
You know what I'm saying. 
you know
First of all, that I'm in hip hop, you know what I'm saying. 
you know
I know some of y'all may be not really as much into the music, but the first way y'all can always know, you know what I'm saying, that I'm in hip hop, is 'cos I hold the microphone in an official emcee posture. 
you know
But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here, I was like, betch, you know what I'm saying, TED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope, you know what I'm saying, shit going on and everything, but she was like, yeah, we're going to have to answer, like, some random questions, just like, and I was like, what the hell is that? 
you know
You know what I'm saying, just stand up there and answer some random questions? 
you know
I don't want to, I mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk. 
i mean
You know what I'm saying?  I don't want to be standing up there just all getting interrogated and whatnot. 
you know
That's what I'm trying to leave behind in New York. You know what I'm saying? 
you know
So anyway, I would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue, you know what I mean? 
you know
So if you want to know more about that, you know what I'm saying, we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that, but as far as I'm concerned, you know, I believe in creative commons, and I think it's really important that, you know, that needs to be sustainable and everything, and I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I mean, this right here, this environment, I would like to sustain. 
you know
You know what I mean? 
you know
But I'm just saying, if y'all are interested in the top five songs, you need to holler at me. 
 just 
You know what I'm saying? 
you know
Okay, next question. 
okay
 Well I have to say that I don't know about how many of my organs have been 3-D printed as such, but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me, kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that, you know, all around the world parents are kind of telling their small children, please, you have to eat that, you know, I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day 
well
You know, that kind of thing. 
you know
And of course now that we have changed, you know, from the global South, there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the -- You can't just say to them, well, there are starving children. 
well
Well, it is the future. 
well
But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism, and I do hope that we can continue to kind of 3D print, well, let us just say I like to think that even in the future we will have the publication, kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print. 
well
Next question.  What has changed? Okay, it's like, I have to think about that. 
okay
First of all, I really, like, I just want to say, and my name is Bella, I just want to, like, identify myself, that, like, as a feminist, I, like, I really find that, like, because I was born in the '90s, and, like, there were a lot of women who were as far as feminism was concerned, like, maybe they didn't understand that, like, a feminist like me, like, I don't think it's required that you have to have 
 just 
Like, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like, Gloria Steinem, and, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug, who's, like, obviously, like, a really important feminist from, like, history, and like, I just think that those women, like, really represent, like, that you can, like, be vital and, like, amazing, like, a-mazing, and you don't have to wear, like, an Eileen Fisher caftan, just to, like, prove that you are a feminist. 
 just 
You guys are a-mazing, by the way. 
by the way
Okay. Next question. 
okay
First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd, a pretty orderly group. 
 just 
But as far as I'm concerned, attractiveness, women don't really care as much as you think they do about the, you know. 
you know
I mean, I remember hearing this woman. 
i mean
It's a pretty young girl, you know? 
you know
And, you know, she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether. 
you know
Um, well, I, I want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a Chinese-American. 
well
 But I always like to just let people know when they ask about race or those kinds of things, you know, as a member of the First Nations community, you know, I'm probably not your typical guy. 
you know
 And, you know, I'm most popular on college and university campuses. 
you know
You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day, or hey-we're-not-all-white week, then I'm there.  Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world? 
you know
Okay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast, as, like, three or four different people. 
well
I'm just gonna let y'all know that, as far as diet is concerned, if you don't love yourself inside, there is no diet on this Earth that is going to make your behind small enough for you to feel good, so just stop wasting your time. 
 just 
I would just like to say as an African woman that I believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside. 
 just 
But I made Sarah Jones promise she gonna bring me this time, 'cause she didn't bring me before, but you know, I just want to say, there's a lot of things more important than counting calories, and as somebody living on the streets in New York, and getting to come here, hear y'all ideas worth spreading, I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea that the present is the new future, 
you know
You know, I might not have me no place to lay my head at night, but that just makes me houseless. 
you know
Make sure you know, it's not just about virtual reality in space. 
you know
You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic. 
you see
I mean, why would anyone treat me differently? 
i mean
And she looked me right in the eye and she said, "They will not always treat you well." 
well
One example from corporate America: Even though white men make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population, they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats. 
 just 
You know, there was institutionalized, at one time legalized, discrimination in our country. 
you know
I have succeeded in my life beyond my wildest expectations, and I have been treated well by people of all races more often than I have not. 
well
You see, researchers have coined this term "color blindness" to describe a learned behavior where we pretend that we don't notice race. 
you see
If we can learn to deal with our discomfort, and just relax into it, we'll have a better life. 
 just 
This brutal pragmatism that she had, I mean, I was four and she told me, "Mommy is Santa."  She was this brutal pragmatism. 
i mean
 You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television and say, "I can be like her," or, "He looks like me." 
you see
You see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave, it's woven into the fabric of America. 
you see
EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable, not to mention irrational. 
you know
I literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next, you know, but it scares me. 
you know
And he said, "Well, you found them." Our command. 
well
"You can just declassify them." 
 just 
And I said, "Well, can we declassify them? 
well
Somebody's going to get my college grades out, a that's going to be a disaster.  But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that I am more scared of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks, because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share. 
okay
I just wonder, do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty? 
 just 
 Now, after 70 nanoseconds, the ball will reach home plate, or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball, and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop, which also starts to disintegrate. 
 um
You can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know, how big are they? 
you know
You know how much they spent, and they also, say, because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided, you might know what they made a deal to buy, so you know how much power it takes. 
you know
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers, and figure out for a data center where you don't have that information, you can figure out, but maybe you only have one of those, you know the square footage, then you could figure out well, maybe the power is proportional. 
well
And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities, you know, with guesses about the total amount of storage, the number of servers, the number of drives per server, and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don't know. 
you know
And in fact, you can just look at pizza delivery drivers. 
 just 
But using some of these same methods, we can look at the NSA's data centers, and figure out, you know, we don't know what's going on there, but it's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google's. 
you know
And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google, because of course they've been so secretive, they didn't answer of my questions, and so I just put it up and said, well, I guess we'll never know. 
well
And on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes, and I said, thank you, thank you, okay, so what's on here? 
okay
What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know, and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper, find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. 
you know
This is a question I got from a reader, an anonymous reader, and the subject line just said, "Urgent," and this was the entire email: "If people had wheels and could fly, how would we differentiate them from airplanes?" 
 just 
Urgent.  And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. 
 just 
The other good thing about watching TED Talks, when you see a really good one, you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day. 
you see
To be honest, it was all about sampling really obscure things, except for a few obvious exceptions like Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo" that we know about. 
to be honest
You know, in music we take something that we love and we build on it. 
you know
There were no samples in this record, although I did look up on the Internet last night, I mean several months ago, that "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England, so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore from "Downton Abbey" coming soon, or that's for another day. 
i mean
And the simplest way that I knew how to co-opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine-year-olds and play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show. 
 just 
But it didn't really matter, because what I wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute. 
 just 
I just loved it, and I thought I could put myself in there. 
 just 
We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing, and all of a sudden everyone's taking these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, "Let's Dance," and all these disco records, and just rapping on them. 
 just 
These records don't really age that well. 
well
You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale. 
 just 
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer, achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound, but without the very, very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick, the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche, to be honest. 
to be honest
I mean, there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements. 
i mean
You know, the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre-written or pre-existing music, you're ineligible for song of the year. 
you know
That's just how it goes. 
 just 
An ant colony consists of sterile female workers -- those are the ants you see walking around — and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs. 
you see
So here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that's connected by tubes to two other arenas. 
you see
So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena, and it's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony, like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest, or how many are going out to forage. 
 just 
So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs, just what it takes to run the system. 
 just 
So an ant outside foraging, searching for seeds in the hot sun, just loses water into the air. 
 just 
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers, and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel, into the nest, and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out. 
you see
So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire, an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage. 
 just 
So then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better? 
okay
So all this time, I thought that colony 154 was a loser, because on really dry days, there'd be just this trickle of foraging, while the other colonies were out foraging, getting lots of food, but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success. 
 just 
The system keeps going unless something negative happens, and one species that I study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back, just round and round, unless something negative happens, like an interaction with ants of another species. 
 just 
But as soon as the threat is passed, the entrance is open again, and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat, and then open it again, instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress. 
 just 
I mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot to prevent cancer by not allowing people to spread around or sell the toxins that promote the evolution of cancer in our bodies, but I don't think the ants can help us much with this because ants never poison their own colonies. 
i mean
And cost us over 10 million jobs as well. 
well
First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy; second, by making or buying really crappy loans, but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield; three, while employing extreme leverage -- that just means a lot of debt -- compared to your equity; and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses. 
 just 
you will report record bank profits -- not just high, record. 
 just 
In other words, a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy. 
well
And it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis, the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars just in the household sector, that cost us 10 million jobs, was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud, particularly using this recipe. 
 just 
In 2000, the year 2000, that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way, the honest appraisers got together a formal petition begging the federal government to act, and the industry to act, to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud. 
by the way
Well, that warning actually comes earlier. 
well
They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together, they're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine. 
 just 
It expanded remarkably as well. 
well
Well, the government, as I told you, when we were the savings and loan regulators, we could only deal with our industry, and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance, we couldn't do anything to them. 
well
They're just horrifically opposed to anything regulatory. 
 just 
Well, in the savings and loan debacle, our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS, made over 30,000 criminal referrals, produced over 1,000 felony convictions just in cases designated as major, and that understates the degree of prioritization, because we worked with the FBI to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes, the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide. 
well
They have produced crony capitalism, in which the largest financial institutions are the leading financial donors of both parties, and that's the reason why even after this crisis, 70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis, we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that I've talked about, other than banning liar's loans, which is good, but that's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon. 
 just 
They put him in the helicopter, and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. 
you see
You know, in the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. 
you know
And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people. 
 just 
In fact, if you have issues, they will coach you and they will give you support, just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. 
 just 
You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts. 
you see
Usually, the outpost was attacked, and we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks, and everyone was just stunned with boredom and heat. 
 just 
The mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents, just the stupid stuff that young men do: jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of, lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire, I mean, you know what I'm talking about. 
you know
Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy, you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most American cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do, statistically. 
 just 
Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did, think about the angle of deviation that saved my life. 
 just 
So you think about Brendan, you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that, a bond like that, in a small group, where they loved 20 other people in some ways more than they loved themselves, you think about how good that would feel, imagine it, and they are blessed with that experience for a year, and then they come home, and they are just back in society like the rest of us are, 
 just 
I could not place it, and it bugged me, and then in the coming week or two, I would just be watching an old movie, and this would happen. 
 just 
  George Costanza: Oh boy, I was up til four in the morning watching that Omen trilogy. 
 oh 
Obviously, the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me. 
 just 
I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually, and I never talked about it with anybody, but it did not, and I totally did. 
 just 
It was totally contrived just for that room, just for that moment. 
 just 
If I just stick to modern male movie stars, I keep it to the length of about a commercial. 
 just 
You know, I was kind of interested. 
you know
Someone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man." 
well
Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence, "I was born at four o'clock in the morning," which I had because someone else had emailed it to me, and when they did, I had another bump up in my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people. 
 just 
It just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape." 
 just 
I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards, not just from L.D., from my life, but for decades. 
 just 
I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds, old Walkman, I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant. 
 just 
So today I'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden world. 
 just 
Well, we know that these juveniles make nasty-tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood, so we think these lights first evolved as a warning, a neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!" 
well
It took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates. 
 just 
Well, they're lounging down below surveying their options. 
well
While they're mating, the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm but also a nutrient-filled package called a nuptial gift. 
 just 
But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said. 
 just 
Over the next hour, she slowly exsanguinates this male leaving behind just some gory remains. 
 just 
After all, they're just one tiny bit of Earth's biodiversity. 
 just 
They've just plucked a few, and all these experiments are based on those, but there's no good evidence at all. 
 just 
It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters. 
well
Well, the first thing, of course, is that we're mammals, and mammals are smelly. 
well
We don't just have one kind of receptor. 
 just 
Well, we really ought to talk about armpits, and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones. 
well
What we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex. 
 just 
As you know, there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet. 
you know
As far back as we can go, we've seen an increase in the amount of food we've been able to harvest from our oceans. It just seemed like it was continuing to increase, until about 1980, when we started to see a decline. 
 just 
You get into international agreements, and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement, you know this can be a very slow, frustrating, tedious process. 
you know
How many fish are actually in these coastal areas Well, you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas, so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing, because we can actually get a lot done. 
well
Well, based on our work in the United States and elsewhere, we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back, and they are: We need to set quotas or limits on how much we take; we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting, and it's very wasteful; and three, we need to protect habitats, 
well
And it's not just in Norway. 
 just 
How many more? Right about now, we can feed about 450 million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch, which, of course, you know is going down, so that number will go down over time if we don't fix it, but if we put fishery management practices like the ones I've described in place in 10 to 25 countries, we could bring that number up 
you know
We should obviously do this just because it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem, but it's also cost-effective. 
 just 
It takes a little bit of fuel, but as you know, agriculture can have a carbon footprint, and fish has a much smaller one, so it's less polluting. 
you know
We're just learning the words, the fragments, the letters in the genetic code. 
 just 
Maybe we should be studying those that are well. 
well
Well, we could look locally. That makes sense. 
well
Maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct genetic context, there might be environmental factors that protect people. 
 just 
Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here." 
 just 
I would have had an easier life if I were straight, but I would not be me, and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else, someone who, to be honest, I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine. 
to be honest
It was dazed, injured, severely underweight, a little mangy-looking, and when Roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree, he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it. 
 just 
It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to sweep it up into your arms and reassure it. 
 just 
One government biologist, he explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization, and so we were just clearing them out of the way. 
 just 
Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals, and I spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals, and all I can really say is that their findings are astonishingly wide-ranging. 
well
What was the context? Well, America was urbanizing. 
well
I mean, we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic. 
i mean
We were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators. 
 just 
But you know, there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about. 
you know
They didn't do too well. 
well
But even with all this marketing, the life of the billy possum turned out to be just pathetically brief. 
 just 
The first, well, it's pretty obvious. 
well
Well, the ones that we've told compelling stories about, the ones we've decided ought to stick around. 
well
Sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts. 
 just 
And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of Roosevelt and that bear in Mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then. 
 just 
Frankly, I joined the Army because college is really damn expensive, and they were going to help with that, and I joined the Army because it was what I knew, and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well. 
well
And then when I was nine years old, she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around, so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like, "Okay, Mommy, I can see you're serious, and I'll work harder." 
okay
They had these big black gates that surrounded the school, and every time they would turn their backs, I would just simply run out of the black gates and take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there, we can leave at any time. 
 just 
So I just said, "Well, if that's the case, then I'd like to leave."  And it never worked. 
well
I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure was something that I'd never found before: the fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger, part of a team, and it actually mattered to people that I was there, the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there, but that it was a real, actually core part 
 just 
of the entire experience. And so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school, I started thinking about what I wanted to do, and just like probably most students, had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do. 
 just 
The question of what I wanted to do was filled in very quickly with saying, I guess I'll be an Army officer. 
i guess
When I went to my mom, I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old, so I literally needed parental permission to join the Army, so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom, and she just assumed it was kind of like military school. 
 just 
She was like, "Well, it was good for him before, so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it," having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing was actually signing her son up to become an Army officer. 
well
And I went through the process, and again the whole time still just thinking, this is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend, or two weeks during the year, do drill, and then a couple years after I signed up, a couple years after my mother signed those papers, the whole world changed. 
 just 
And what was amazing to me was that I very naively started hearing this statement that I never fully understood, because right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say, "Well, thank you for your service." 
well
And I just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers. 
 just 
I just said it because it sounded right. 
 just 
Because sometimes there's this fear and there's this apprehension that if I say anything, I'm afraid I'll offend, or I'm afraid I'll trigger something, so the common default is just saying nothing. 
 just 
Well, "Thank you for your service" means to me, it means acknowledging our stories, asking us who we are, understanding the strength that so many people, so many people who we serve with, have, and why that service means so much. 
well
"Thank you for your service" means acknowledging the fact that just because we've now come home and we've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over. 
 just 
He comes back and instead of deciding that, well, now since I've lost my leg, that second dream is over, he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball, and he starts this group called VETSports, which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing. 
well
And the only thing we then ask is that "thank you for your service" needs to be more than just a quote break, that "thank you for your service" means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to, and what that means for us not just now, not just during combat operations, but long after the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken. 
 just 
Until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well, not only work to survive, there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape, of liberation and, of course, of rebellion. 
well

You don't have to believe in a God per se, just in being Jewish."  So if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi, and if you have to believe in God in order to be religious, then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi without believing in God, Judaism isn't a religion. 
 just 
Now you might think this just shows that I've given you the wrong definition and that I should come up with some other definition and test it against these cases and try and find something that captures atheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism, and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity, but I actually think that that's a bad idea, and the reason I think it's a bad idea is that I don't think that's how 
 just 
I think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have, we have a list of paradigm religions and their sub-parts, right, and if something new comes along that purports to be a religion, what we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?" 
well
By the end of the 19th century, you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is. 
 just 
So there's a big change, and that division, that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say, I think, of the 19th century in Europe, there's a real intellectual division of labor, and you can do all sorts of serious things, including, increasingly, even philosophy, without being constrained by the thought, "Well, what I have to say has to be consistent with the deep truths that are given to me by our religious tradition." 
well
Well, here's one thing he would have noticed, and by the way, there was a person who actually did this. 
well
My father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey, which I'm glad to say was very often, he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground, and he would talk to, he would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line, or Yao Antony, my great uncle, he would talk to them, offer them a little bit of this. 
 just 
So he's a religious figure, as Rattray would have said, as well as a political figure. 
well
Religion has not being separated from any other areas of life, and in particular, what's crucial to understand about this world is that it's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what Rattray is going to call religion, because if they want an explanation of something, if they want to know why the crop just failed, if they want to know why it's raining 
 just 
to the various parts of the [ceremony], they prayed not just in a generic way but for the safety of the journey, and they meant it, and when they said to me that my mother, the bridegroom's [grandmother], was with us, they didn't mean it figuratively. 
 just 
Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan, that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year. 
you know
What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion, an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. 
 just 
Well, we asked thousands of people. 
well
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect, you can connect these two lines, and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do. 
you see
Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things. 
 just 
Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality: neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness. 
you know
Again, we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years, and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years, and what we found, well, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over, because once again the rate of change does slow as we age, but at every age, people underestimate in the next decade. 
well
And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality. 
 just 
And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now, and here it is again: people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in 10 years, the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in 10 years, and yet, people who are 10 years older all say, "Eh, you know, that's really changed." 
well
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences? 
 just 
The greek word poem, it just means "a made thing," and poetry is a set of techniques, ways of making patterns that put emotions into words. 
 just 
The more techniques you know, the more things you can make, and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love. 
you know
It says poems can bring people together temporarily, which I think is true, and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes, cleanly and simply on the two and four, "say" and "way," with anticipatory hints on the one and three, "answer" and "quarters," as if the poem itself were coming together. 
 just 
I just heard that there were these scandalous writers called Language poets who didn't make any sense, and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like, and some of them didn't do much for me, but this writer, Rae Armantrout, did an awful lot, and I kept reading her until I felt I knew what was going on, as I do with this poem. 
 just 
Now, how do I know that I'm right Well in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it." 
well
You can't be sure, and that's okay. 
okay
"Brave" has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense, courage. 
well
This person might want to run away too, but fortified by the sun's example, he might just rise. 
 just 
Poems, the patterns in poems, show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but what it was like to be a person like that, to be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive, so goofy, so preposterous, so brave. 
 just 
It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished, he probably left it unfinished, and because it might be meant for a character in a play, but it might just be Keats' thinking about what his own writing, his handwriting, could do, and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality, and I hear the power of older poetic techniques, and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling, of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming, 
 just 
It has spines, gluey pads and claws, but if you take off those feet, they can still go over rough terrain, like the bottom video that you see, without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary. 
you see
And I point out that all of these videos are slowed down 20 times, so they're actually really fast, when you see this. 
you see
It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb, but when you slow it down, you see something very different. 
you see
And they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another. 
 just 
You see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane. 
you see
It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin, and was a thin covering around their walnut-sized brain, but it was capable of a new type of thinking. 
 just 
Another mouse watching this could say, "Hey, that was pretty clever, going around that rock," and it could adopt a new behavior as well. 
well
That was perfectly okay 200 million years ago. 
okay
So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex, but no, they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor, and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points. 
 just 
"You guys are so funny just standing around," was the typical comment, and they weren't funny, not while doing surgery. 
 just 
Well, computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex. 
well
Five to 10 years from now, search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding, reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books. 
 just 
So you'll be walking along, and Google will pop up and say, "You know, Mary, you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn't getting past the blood-brain barrier. 
you know
Well, new research just came out 13 seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione. 
well
Now today, I mean, you have a computer in your phone, but if you need 10,000 computers for a few seconds to do a complex search, you can access that for a second or two in the cloud. 
i mean
And this wasn't just an abstract question. 
 just 
Let's just look at a few of these strategies. 
 just 
So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott, a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy. It's known as Stonewall, in 1969, and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting. Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion, and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism, 
 just 
He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well, and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles. 
well
Okay, are you registered to vote? 
okay
Man: No. Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you? 
okay
SM: Okay, why? What's up? Man: I ain't with that. 
okay
SM: But you know what? 
you know
SM: Vote for 6, okay? Man 2: I got you. 
okay
What's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is, it really shows how Karess understands the history of the civil rights movement, but she's not restricted by it. 
 just 
She doesn't just limit it to black people. 
 just 
I just want to read what he said at that inauguration: "We the people declare today that the most evident of truths, that all of us are created equal. 
 just 
It is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall." 
 just 
So just as Martin Luther King learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolence, which became a bedrock of the civil rights movement, the gay rights movement saw what worked in the civil rights movement, and they used some of those same strategies and tactics to make gains at an even quicker pace. 
 just 
I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela of South Africa. 
 just 
They just made it up. 
 just 
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago, and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism. 
 just 
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it, and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. 
 just 
They described it as "compelling and well-written." 
well
So I am here today because I think we need hackers, and in fact, they just might be the immune system for the information age. 
 just 
And I wanted to be just like her, so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums. 
 just 
It was a simple trick, and I was just a script kiddie back then, but to me, that trick, it felt like this, like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips. 
 just 
It's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower, one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect, but thankfully no radioactive spiders. 
 just 
But there are other hackers, hackers who just like to break things, and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it. 
 just 
This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers. 
well
And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down. 
 just 
It worked so well, in fact, one guy even used it to download an episode of "How I Met Your Mother." 
well
But while Egypt's future is still uncertain, when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later, Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines, and Anonymous, they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website. 
 just 
This is because access to information is a critical currency of power, one which governments would like to control, a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs, a thing they need hackers for, by the way. 
by the way
Well, hackers in the back row replied, "Then stop arresting us." 
well
My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers: They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be. 
 just 
They make us, they force us to fix things or demand something better, and I think we need them to do just that, because after all, it is not information that wants to be free, it's us. 
 just 
It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working. 
 just 
I felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university, because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton or any other scientist whose results I had learned about, because in science, we just learn about the results, not the process. 
 just 
Improvisation theater, just like science, goes into the unknown, because you have to make a scene onstage without a director, without a script, without having any idea what you'll portray or what the other characters will do. 
 just 
Because you see, whenever people do anything, for example if I want to touch this blackboard, my brain first builds up a schema, a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do and if I get blocked, if my schema doesn't match reality, that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance. 
you see
Now just knowing that word, the cloud, has been transformational in my research group, because students come to me and say, "Uri, I'm in the cloud," and I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable." 
 just 
 But I'm kind of happy, because we might be close to the boundary between the known and the unknown, and we stand a chance of discovering something truly new, since the way our mind works, it's just knowing that the cloud is normal, it's essential, and in fact beautiful, we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society, and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me. 
 just 
For example, if one actor says, "Here is a pool of water," and the other actor says, "No, that's just a stage," the improvisation is over. 
 just 
For example, we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells, and we said, "We are deeply in the cloud," and we had a playful conversation where my student Shai Shen Orr said, "Let's just draw this on a piece of paper, this network," and instead of saying, "But we've done that so many times and it doesn't work," I said, "Yes, and let's use a very big piece of paper," 
 just 
and then Ron Milo said, "Let's use a gigantic architect's blueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it," and we printed out the network and looked at it, and that's where we made our most important discovery, that this complicated network is just made of a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a stained glass window. 
 just 
Soon enough, after this, I started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world, but the knowledge about the cloud and saying "Yes, and" just stayed within my own lab, because you see, in science, we don't talk about the process, anything subjective or emotional. 
you see
And when you label something as objective and rational, automatically, the other side, the subjective and emotional, become labeled as non-science or anti-science or threatening to science, and we just don't talk about it. 
 just 
♪ I've been scooped again ♪ ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ ♪ Oh mama, can't you feel my pain ♪ ♪ Heavens help me, I've been scooped again ♪  Thank you. 
 oh 
So my vision is that, just like every scientist knows the word "atom," that matter is made out of atoms, every scientist would know the words like "the cloud," saying "Yes, and," and science will become much more creative, make many, many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all, and would also be much more playful. 
 just 
Part of me was like, okay, when's he going to ask me to wire 10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right? 
okay
And I won't name names, but you know who you are. 
you know
I'm on it. Many of you are on it, whether you know it or not, and you can see the links. 
you know
We have just 17 links between us. 
 just 
They are our great-great-great-great-great-great -- continue that for about 7,000 times -- grandparents, and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as well, and estimates vary, but probably the farthest cousin you have on Earth is about a 50th cousin. 
well
Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants. 
 just 
We're not just part of the same species. 
 just 
The other set of people, their eyes light up, and they say, "You are just the person I want to talk to." 
 just 
He brought up Facebook, and he said, "To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?" 
i mean
Okay, so that looks like most of you. 
okay
Okay, many fewer. 
okay
Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors, what they'll tell you is they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. 
 just 
They try to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive, often through usage labels, but they're in something of a bind, because they're trying to describe what we do, and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately. 
well
To show you what I mean, we'll look at an example, but before we do, I want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note. 
i mean
Well, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books, here is what you find. 
well
Well, it sure looks like "impactful" is proving useful for a certain number of writers, and has become more and more useful over the last 20 years. 
well
Well, you know what? 
well
Language just doesn't work that way. 
 just 
I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating, just the way dictionary editors do. 
 just 
But I came from a modest immigrant family where my idea of luxury was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich so the thought of spending my whole life sitting around in armchairs just thinking, well, that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity. 
well
It's a mistake to think that in hard choices, one alternative really is better than the other, but we're too stupid to know which, and since we don't know which, we might as well take the least risky option. 
well
If alternatives are equally good, you should just flip a coin between them, and it seems a mistake to think, here's how you should decide between careers, places to live, people to marry: Flip a coin. 
 just 
Even as a little kid, I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California. 
 just 
So, from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole, just to go to school. 
 just 
You take an angry man to the Himalayas, he just starts complaining about the food. 
 just 
And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes by going nowhere, just by sitting still. 
 just 
And by going nowhere, I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season, or even, as some people do, a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most, to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life 
i mean
I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about; the indoor tree houses, the trampolines, workers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering. 
 just 
that sitting still, or meditation, can lead not just to better health or to clearer thinking, but even to emotional intelligence. 
 just 
I've never begun to have those resources, but I sometimes remember that any time I want, I can get a second home in time, if not in space, just by taking a day off. 
 just 
Otherwise, really, I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness, which is no blessing at all. 
 just 
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it. 
 just 
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt, Germany, and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about 30 minutes, and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours. 
 just 
She didn't once turn on her video monitor, she never pulled out a book, she didn't even go to sleep, she just sat still, and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me. 
 just 
Some people I know, just before they go to sleep, instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube, just turn out the lights and listen to some music, and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed. 
 just 
How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples? 
you know
But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. 
well
And you know what? She's not standing still. 
you know
But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations. 
you know
What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed? 
you see
So everything that you see here has been 3D printed, including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. 
you see
There's nothing like starting a conversation with, "Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth 20 points in Scrabble?" 
you know
But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well. 
well
Okay. 
okay
It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about in "Don Quixote," which by the way is the root of the word "quixotry," the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time, 365 points. 
 just 
Okay, good, because I need somebody smart here because now I'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is, just how wired to solve all of you really are, so I'm going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me. 
 just 
Did you know that your name is worth eight points in Scrabble? 
you know
Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here. 
okay
Now, Gwen, before we begin, I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle, which is here in this envelope, and I will not go near it. Okay? 
okay
You can see we have an owl, we have a horse, a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep, and then here, Gwen, we have some fancy art store markers, colors like, can you see that word right there? 
you see
But we have a silver, a red, an emerald, and an amber marker, and Gwen, you are going to color this drawing just like you were five years old, one marker at a time. 
 just 
Okay, so don't start yet. 
okay
Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker, and why don't you color in the horse for me? 
 just 
Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup and take off the cap and color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey. 
okay
Okay, cool, and re-cap that marker and place it on the table. 
okay
Okay, and recap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster. 
okay
Okay, good. 
okay
Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around. 
okay
Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse, amber owl, a silver ox, yes, okay, a red donkey, and what was the emerald color? A rooster. 
okay
An emerald rooster. Okay. 
okay
Gwen, well done. That's beautiful.  I'll take that back from you. 
well
How is this possible? Well, could it be that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages? 
well
Well this is the puzzle I present to you. 
well
Many of you in the first couple of rows have it underneath your seats as well. 
well
If you look at the first clue for 1-across, it starts with the letter C, for corrupt, and just below that we have an O, for outfielder, and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down, you get cobalt horse, amber owl, silver ox, red donkey, and emerald rooster. 
 just 
Well, if you keep reading starting with 25-down, it says, "Oh, by the way, the sheep can be left blank." 
well
Today, a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells And announced that I'm "articulate" Which means that when it comes I don't even think of it ‘Cause I’m "articulate" So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion There’s no misdirected intention Pay attention ‘Cause I’m “articulate” So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?” My “articulate” answer never goes amiss 
well
I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand” And when I’m on the block I switch it up just because I can So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?” I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!” And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask “Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples” Yes, I have decided to treat 
 just 
Throughout this ordeal, no one hugged me, no one counseled me, no one told me I would be okay. 
okay
Earlier in my incarceration, I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim, and in that letter, she told me she forgave me, because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions. 
 just 
And he was like, "K is okay." 
okay
So in my head, I was like, "Well what the hell is wrong with K?" 
well
And he said, "K = okay." 
okay
The password requirement up through 2009 was just that you had to have a password with at least one character. 
 just 
And I said, "Well, you know what? 
well
We said, "Well, there's a need for good password data. 
well
No, we just asked them about their password. 
 just 
So this suggests that, instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords, we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords. 
 just 
They tell you you're doing a good job too early, and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback, you probably would have better passwords. 
 just 
"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd. 
you see
And we looked at that, and we said, "Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable." 
well
On the other hand, we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well, and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better. 
well
We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. 
well
Okay, I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school. 
okay
And what we found out -- we found 17 people so far, I think, who have the word "monkey" -- We found out about a third of them said they have a pet named "monkey" or a friend whose nickname is "monkey," and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute. 
 just 
Well, scientists don't like talking about science as a matter of belief. 
well
Blaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in God, and his wager went like this: Well, if God doesn't exist but I decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost. 
well
And indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well So if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you whether a vaccine is safe. 
well
According to the standard model, the textbook model, scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses, and then they go out into the world and they say, "Okay, well are those consequences true?" 
well
When Einstein developed the theory of general relativity, one of the consequences of his theory was that space-time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric. 
 just 
And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea: ideally, it is a law of nature. 
 just 
And all of you know of at least one example of a famous law: Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2, which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass. 
you know
It's just not true.  And I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong. 
 just 
So just because the prediction comes true doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct. 
 just 
Well, why? 
well
Well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true. 
well
Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the Earth around the sun. 
well
And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius -- well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars, but imagine you're out in the country, imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in December, we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. 
well
Well, in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which we would now say were incorrect. 
well
Today we would draw the picture more like this, this comes from NASA, and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small. 
you see
So, there's a third problem as well. 
well
And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses, often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world. 
 just 
He just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data. 
 just 
Well, one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea. 
well
You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. 
well
I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots. 
well
Well, scientists can model it using a computer simulation. 
well
And so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening, we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. 
 just 
Or, they can say, well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence. 
well
But this leads us to one final problem: If science is what scientists say it is, then isn't that just an appeal to authority? 
 just 
Well, here's the paradox of modern science, the paradox of the conclusion I think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to, that actually science is the appeal to authority, but it's not the authority of the individual, no matter how smart that individual is, like Plato or Socrates or Einstein. 
well
 Okay, so that brings me to my final point. 
okay
Well, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan, this is a bad analogy, but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition, and their cars work, and they work incredibly well. 
well
So why is that? Why do cars work so well? 
well
We benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work And the same is true of science, only science is even older. 
 just 
They have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it, and it means that we have to become better listeners. 
 just 
Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us. 
well
We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. 
you know
Well, this is the national art of the U.K. 
well
They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. 
 just 
You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. 
you know
The word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well. 
well
The A is authenticity, just being yourself. 
 just 
I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons. 
well
I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. 
i mean
But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. 
well
I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking. 
 just 
Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train. 
well
We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. 
 um
Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. 
 just 
Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up. 
well
And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. 
 just 
Now let me just put this in context to close. 
 just 
We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. 
well
Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here. 
 just 
We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros. 
 just 
A big part of my job is defending all of these things, keeping them working, but once in a while, part of my job is to break one of these things, because cyber isn't just about defense, it's also about offense. 
 just 
You've got your contacts list, your email, and probably 500 apps you've never used in your entire life, and behind all of this is the software, the code, that controls your phone, and somewhere, buried inside of that code, is a tiny piece that controls your battery, and that's what I'm really after, but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros, and it's all just mixed together. 
 just 
I'm looking for one key piece, but it just blends in with everything else. 
 just 
I just didn't know how they fit together. 
 just 
But instead of just going home and calling it quits, I took a step back and asked myself, what went wrong here? 
 just 
Well I thought, when you're looking at information at this level, it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing. 
well
Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem, we should have been making the problem fit our minds, because our brains have a tremendous potential for analyzing huge amounts of information, just not like this. 
 just 
So what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information? 
 just 
Things that would take us weeks, months to find in ones and zeroes, are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction, and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it, in a matter of seconds just by using our brain's built-in ability to analyze patterns. 
 just 
This is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation. 
well
And from here, I can see, it's not just an image, this is a photograph. 
 just 
It's brought a lot of bad stuff, like the stuff that I just described, but it's also brought a lot of good stuff. 
 just 
Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons, but perhaps the primary reason is because we're still organized as a species 200 or 300 years ago. 
well
There's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion people, the seven billion of us who cause all these problems, the same seven billion, by the way, who will resolve them all. 
by the way
Well, the first and most obvious reason is because that's what we ask them to do. 
well
The second reason is that these governments, just like all the rest of us, are cultural psychopaths. 
 just 
I don't mean to be rude, but you know what a psychopath is. 
you know
This is just nonsense. 
 just 
And so you may say, well, given all of that, why then doesn't it work? 
well
Well I, like a lot of us, spend a lot of time complaining about how hard it is to make people change, and I don't think we should fuss about it. 
well
I think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species. 
 just 
It's very simple: Many thousands of years ago, we discovered that if we carried on doing the same things, we wouldn't die, because the things that we've done before by definition didn't kill us, and therefore as long as we carry on doing them, we'll be okay, and it's very sensible not to do anything new, because it might kill you. 
okay
So I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years trying to find out what could be that self-interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations, all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly, to think in a bigger picture, not always to look inwards, sometimes to look outwards. 
 just 
Why did I do this? Well, because the governments that I advise are very, very keen on knowing how they are regarded. 
well
This is a discovery of significant importance — you see where I'm going — because it squares the circle. 
you see
I can now say, and often do, to any government, in order to do well, you need to do good. 
well
And I'm going to tell you, but first of all I want to tell you precisely what I mean I do not mean morally good. 
i mean
When I say that Country X is the goodest country on Earth, and I mean goodest, I don't mean best. 
i mean
I'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower-lying countries. 
 just 
Countries like China and Russia and India, which is down in the same part of the index, well, in some ways, it's not surprising. 
well
Well, it's there really because I want to try to introduce this word, or reintroduce this word, into the discourse. 
well
So, start with stereotypes. You look at me, you know my name, you know certain facts about me, and you could make certain judgments. 
you know
Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us. 
 just 
He just arbitrarily divided them up. 
 just 
And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change. 
well
And you would say, well that's too bad, and you'd go on to the rest of your life. 
well
And we bind ourselves in other ways as well. 
well
We know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job, for an award, we are strongly biased by their race, we are biased by their gender, we are biased by how attractive they are, and sometimes we might say, "Well fine, that's the way it should be." 
well
And so to combat this, we don't just try harder, but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can't bias us, which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens, so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter. 
 just 
Well —  — I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America, boldly going to a strange new world, seeking new opportunities. 
well
On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday, and just a few weeks after my birthday, my parents got my younger brother, my baby sister and me up very early one morning, and they dressed us hurriedly. 
 just 
They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country, and they proved that being an American is not just for some people, that race is not how we define being an American. 
 just 
So remember before the Internet?  I call this B.I. Okay? 
okay
What happened after the Internet was the cost of innovation went down so much because the cost of collaboration, the cost of distribution, the cost of communication, and Moore's Law made it so that the cost of trying a new thing became nearly zero, and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo, students that didn't have permission — permissionless innovation — didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints, they just built the thing, 
 just 
So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware. 
 just 
And so what you see is that is pushing innovation to the edges. 
you see
This is a recent thing, but this will happen and this will change just like it did with software. 
 just 
And these people I wouldn't have been able to find that I found them just in time from the network. 
 just 
Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter. 
okay
Subsequently, Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups would murder as many as 200,000 civilians in what came to be known as the dark decade of the 1990s, including every single one of the women that you see here. 
you see
You see, in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians, there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you don't hear about, and those people need our support to succeed. 
you see
You see, they're much more likely to be victims of this violence than its perpetrators. 
you see
Let me just give you one example. 
 just 
Now I've been talking for the last five minutes about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know exactly what I mean. 
i mean
But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg. 
 just 
The first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist or something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist, and this is just offensive and wrong, but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all or, even worse, apologizes for it, and this is unacceptable as well. 
well
As Faizan said at the time, if we bow down to the Islamists, we'll just be sitting in a dark corner. 
 just 
But he doesn't just criticize the mosque. 
 just 
The men who cut her throat then told everyone else, "If you go to university, the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this." 
 just 
It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers, it is not enough just to battle terrorism. 
 just 
Why is it that people like her, like all of them are not more well known? 
well
We don't have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because Western policy is flawed as well, because 5:17 is still coming in places like northern Nigeria, where jihadis still kill students. 
well
 And knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job, which is that of a psychoanalyst. 
well
He and I were together on the panel, and just before delivering our papers — we didn't know each other's papers — we decided to take chance seriously. 
 just 
Now, you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what they'd just listened to was a completely random paper. 
 just 
They thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it's random. 
 just 
Now, in regard to the current economic crisis, we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before, and no political or social changes are needed. 
 just 
In regard to ecological crisis, we think nothing needs to be done just now, or others need to act before us. 
 just 
Now, psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don't have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance. 
well
Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it in the future, but maybe they think, my son might become the next Bill Gates. 
okay
Sadly, this ideology still functions very well, which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty. 
well
There was music playing on this day, I think it was Madonna's greatest hits.  And there was plenty of conversation, not just about the patient's heart rate, but about sports and weekend plans. 
 just 
In some weird way, it's just another day at the office. 
 just 
And that's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening. 
you know
And, oh by the way, this hasn't changed for 25 years. 
 oh 
So this is the moment when I started thinking, okay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery, why not other areas of medicine? 
okay
And here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found that involve some tissue puncture step. 
 just 
And if we take just three of them — laparoscopic surgery, epidurals, and cranial drilling — these procedures account for over 30,000 complications every year in this country alone. 
 just 
They're soft, they're slimy, and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment, either to attract mates, for self-defense, or to attract food. 
by the way
So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out, trying that out, and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with. 
 just 
I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens. 
 just 
I was quite impressed by this feat, at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory, know itself, and move with seeming intention. 
 just 
The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network —  — a complex system developed over time by community dwellings, civil engineering, urban planning. 
well
What had taken us well over 100 years took the slime mold just over a day. 
well
So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism. 
 just 
We didn't just give them oats. 
 just 
 It's okay, it's safe here. 
okay
 Okay. 
okay
Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period. 
okay
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you were just naturally great at? 
 just 
Have you ever thought that working on an issue between you was futile because it should just be easier than this, or this is supposed to happen just naturally? 
 just 
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run, just happens naturally? 
 just 
Debbie has worked all her life, pays taxes, supports herself month to month, proud of the American dream, a dream that just won't be complete without higher education. 
 just 
We just looked at what wasn't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it. 
 just 
I spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation, and that's just time that most researchers can't afford. 
 just 
Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis. 
 just 
Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study, and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore. 
 just 
But for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations. 
 just 
I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown, I'll have learned to speak French, and when I'm grown, I'll learn how to manage my money, and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter, and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and, you know. 
you know
 So I can talk about it now because I've reached this point, where — I mean, I'm 28. 
i mean
So, I might as well come clean about it. 
well
And when I was younger, that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me, singing, so I did it a lot. 
well
If the trend continues, the top one percent will share over 30 percent of national [income] while the bottom 50 percent of Americans will share just six. 
 just 
You see, the problem isn't that we have some inequality. 
you see
Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks, but it's also terrible for business too. 
 just 
When Ford famously introduced the $5 day, which was twice the prevailing wage at the time, he didn't just increase the productivity of his factories, he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made. 
 just 
Middle-out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic, that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness, and instead embraces the 21st-century idea that economies are complex, adaptive, ecosystemic, that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality, that they're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed. 
well
And yet, just 350 days after that article was published, Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle to 15 dollars an hour, more than double what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is. 
 just 
Your politician's always echoing that trickle-down idea by saying things like, "Well, if you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it." 
well
Because, you see, Washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation. 
you see
We plutocrats know, even if we don't like to admit it in public, that if we had been born somewhere else, not here in the United States, we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. 
well
It's just that that's all that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford. 
 just 
 And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby, and this is just routine, it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress. 
 just 
And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor, just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day. 
 just 
He said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances." 
well
I said okay. I said, "What if I was at 36 weeks with this same data? 
okay
"Well, no, I would wait until you were at least 38 weeks, but you are almost 42, there is no reason to leave that baby inside, let's get you a room." 
well
I said, "Well, why don't we just do it again? 
well
We can average the two and see what that means.  And he goes, "Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage." 
 just 
So I say, "Okay, great. Do I go from a 30-percent chance to a 60-percent chance? 
okay
And he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles, and we really just want what's best for the baby." 
 just 
I said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women, how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date? 
 just 
I said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many are going to miscarry just after their due date?" 
 just 
"About two."  I said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances go from a 0.1-percent chance to a 0.2-percent chance." 
okay
Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced, and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of Cesarean sections, and if at all possible we'd like to avoid that. 
okay
Well, we had data that told a different story. 
well
Clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle. 
you see
Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle, the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature. 
well
Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs. 
well
That's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot, because their temperatures are high. 
you see
You'll see the low temperature level and then a shift and for about five days, that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant, and then you see those temperatures start to go up a little bit. 
you see
Had I not been taking my temperature I really would have just thought my period was late that month, but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby, and even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives, it was information that we could then take to our doctor. 
 just 
And it's not just about temperatures and it's not just about fertility; we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things. 
 just 
For instance, did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid? 
you know
But what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well? 
well
So just by collecting your temperature every day, you get information about the condition of your thyroid. 
 just 
And I roll over and I look, and I said, "Well, can you breath out of your mouth?" 
well
We just got married, people will think I killed you!  And so, we get to the emergency room, and the nurse sees us, and he can't breath out of his nose, and so she brings us to the back and the doctor says, "What seems to be the problem?" and he goes, "I can't breath out of my nose." 
 just 
And we are thinking, no, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe, just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no. 
 just 
And so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis, and he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down." 
 just 
He says, "Well, do you two exercise?" 
well
And he says, "What were you doing just before you came here?" 
 just 
But okay, what was Donald doing just before? 
 just 
And he looks at us and says, "Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the emergency room and says he can't breath, you assume he's having a heart attack and you ask questions later." 
well
By taking ownership of your data just like we've done, just by taking this daily measurements about yourself, you become the expert on your body. 
 just 
And so when two of you come together, when two experts come together, the two of you are able to make a better decision than just your doctor alone. 
 just 
Now this was the early '80s, and prisons weren't quite what you see on TV or in the movies. 
you see
And just in case you wondered, they shared one toilet in those small confines. 
 just 
One day, one of them commented to me and said, "You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires. 
you know
We changed the skill set, reducing violence, not just responding to it. 
 just 
Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson, they assigned me to headquarters next, and that's where I ran straight up against system change. 
 just 
The project just made my job more interesting and exciting. 
 just 
Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control, but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face with other inmates and staff, and because control was no longer an issue, everybody could focus on other things, like learning. Behavior changed. 
okay
Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates, and when our prisons are safe, we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling. 
 just 
To be honest with you, preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions. 
to be honest
If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime, I'm afraid we'll never get there. 
 just 
I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to, told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own, so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything, appeasing ignorance with my silence, unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence. 
 just 
I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau, and just because you watched one episode of "The Wire" doesn't mean you know anything about my kids. 
you know
Now, I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up.  Why is it that the very word "civics" has such a soporific, even a narcoleptic effect on us? 
 just 
Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us, people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online, in any way we can, to make civics sexy again, as sexy as it was during the American Revolution, as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement. 
well
It just is. 
 just 
I mean, think about it: How does a friendship become a subsidy? 
i mean
Insidiously, just the way that stop-and-frisk, for instance, became over time a bureaucratic numbers game. 
 just 
They'd rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism. 
 just 
There are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen, the fortunate and unfortunate alike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation, of power. 
 just 
Well, this problem, this challenge, is a thing that we must now confront, and I believe that when you have this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance, it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago, this profound civic inequality. 
well
I'll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines. 
 just 
Well, Xcel fought back, and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this municipalization. 
well
Well now, recently, the Machine has started to get involved in actual city politics, and they've engineered the election of a former Machine member, a young, pro-business recent graduate to the Tuscaloosa city school board. 
well
Now, as I say, these are just two examples drawn almost at random from the headlines. 
 just 
Could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know? 
you know
Civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward, and this great innovation, this great wave of localism that's now arriving, and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives, this isn't some precious parochialism, this isn't some retreat into insularity, no. 
you see
I was I suppose the first user. 
i suppose
Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED, the first question you ask is, what can we do as quickly as possible? 
okay
But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent, because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web-enabled life, you don't remember things anymore, you just look them up, then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back. 
 just 
The healthcare, late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have, when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country. 
 just 
So we cannot assume that part of the web, part of the deal with the web, is when I use the web, it's just a transparent, neutral medium. 
 just 
So in fact, something we realized, we can't just use the web, we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing, is it in fact of a quality that we need? 
 just 
So this is just some of the things that I want, from a big list, obviously it's longer. 
 just 
Fight for it for me. Okay? Thanks. 
okay
Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination, and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series, a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes, a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes, and the end of every book, they get the bad guy with their hairnet, and they proclaim, "Justice is served!" 
well
And I partnered with the School Nutrition Association, and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day. 
you know
And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray. 
well
Another woman said to me, "You know, what I got out of this is that what I do is important." 
you know
Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI. 
you see
In 2008, I was working for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda, and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister. 
 just 
You see that around March 6, the clouds move in and then disappear, and then around the March 11, the clouds really move in. 
you see
This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as 1984, and that's important, because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years, you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future, and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought. 
you know
Now many of you know microcredit, the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Grameen Bank. 
you know
They were all providing loans to farmers, and often, just before they'd finalize the loan, the farmer would say, "But what if it doesn't rain? 
 just 
For the next three weeks, there wasn't a single drop of rain, and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died. 
well
But you know, he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture, so we had to zoom out a lot. 
you know
He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder and that's really just the tip of the iceberg. 
 just 
I have a Ph.D. in history of science and had you asked me 10 years ago if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally, had emotions, I would have said yes, but I'm not sure that I would have told you that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder, a Prozac prescription and a therapist. 
 just 
But then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can, and actually trying to help my own dog overcome his panic and his anxiety, it just changed my life. 
 just 
Many of us think that we can't know what another animal is thinking, and that is true, but any of you in relationships — at least this is my case — just because you ask someone that you're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn't mean that they can tell you. 
 just 
Before the early 20th century, physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation. 
 just 
Mood disorders, too, may actually just be the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal, and obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed. 
 just 
This is just one search I did for "OCD dog" but I encourage all of you to look at "OCD cat." 
 just 
You will be shocked by what you see. 
you see
I'm going to show you just a couple examples. 
 just 
He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen. 
 just 
And if you just sort of happened upon this scene, you might think that Ting Ting is just playing with a stick, but Ting Ting does this all day, and if you pay close attention and if I showed you guys the full half-hour of this clip, you'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order, and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time. 
 just 
But it's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in. 
 just 
Lots of creatures — this horse is just one example — develop self-destructive behaviors. 
 just 
So two dogs, raised in the same household, exposed to the very same things, one may develop, say, a debilitating fear of motorcycles, or a phobia of the beep of the microwave, and another one is going to be just fine. 
 just 
So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently: Is this just an instance of humans driving other animals crazy? 
 just 
Or, is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse? 
 just 
And I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it." 
well
But they worried, because he was social, that he was lonely, and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey, because they thought with just one arm, he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play. 
 just 
 So one thing that I would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered to make some assumptions about the creatures that you know well. 
well
So then the choice becomes, how do you anthropomorphize well? 
well
Anthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other animals' minds and experiences, and there's actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well, and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry. 
well
These drugs were tested in non-human animals first, and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects. 
 just 
Today, however, we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects, but they're giving them these drugs as patients, both in ethical and much less ethical ways. 
 just 
And it's now not just the nuclear threat; in our interconnected world, network breakdowns can cascade globally; air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days; and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light. We fret too much about minor hazards — improbable air crashes, carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, and so forth — but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. 
 just 
But if an event is potentially devastating, it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely, just as we take out fire insurance on our house. 
 just 
Within a few decades, to misuse rapidly advancing biotech, just as they misuse cybertech today. 
 just 
Freeman Dyson, in a TED Talk, foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. 
 just 
Well, this may be on the science fiction fringe, but were even part of his scenario to come about, our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed. 
well
Well, can we guard against such risks by regulation? 
well
Well luckily, reassurance could be offered. 
well
And by the way, our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question, and it's this: Consider two scenarios. 
by the way
It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters. 
 just 
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue as an observer, as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief, and as an activist, I looked at it as a defender of rights, but as a citizen journalist, I suddenly felt very vulnerable. 
you see
I mean, here she was, a young woman who was using a channel to talk about her experience just as I was, and yet I felt unsettled. 
 just 
You see, no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act. 
you see
So after a lot of thought, I recorded a video blog in response, and I told Michaela, well, there are different sides to India, and I also tried to explain that things would be okay and I expressed my regret for what she had faced. 
well
We don't realize that when we are standing up, we are not just standing up as individuals, we are standing up for our communities, our friends, our peers. 
 just 
Don't get me wrong, the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real, but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media blindly. 
 just 
As I end this talk, I just want to say that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets, but let us speak up. 
 just 
But as we enter this era of big data, what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different, capable of changing the questions we want to ask, and this difference is not about how much data we collect, it's whether those data open new windows into our universe, whether they change the way we view the sky. 
 just 
Why time? Well, time is about origins, and it's about evolution. 
well
This is the view of the night sky that you would see, and it's a beautiful view, with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon. 
 just 
In fact, if we could go back to our tranquil skies above Chile, and we allow time to move forward to see how the sky might change over the next year, the pulsations that you see are supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star exploding, brightening and then fading from view, each one of these supernovae five billion times the brightness of our sun, so we can see them to great distances 
you see
This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun, and it's these changes and the motion and it's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe, to predict its future and to explain its past. 
you see
The Hubble Space Telescope: for the last 25 years it's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe, but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image of the sky, it would take 13 million individual images, about 120 years to do this just once. 
 just 
Well, how do you capture an image at this scale? 
well
Well, you build the largest digital camera in history, using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the High Street, but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across, about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, where one image is three billion pixels. 
well
So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution, just a single LSST image, it would take about 1,500 high-definition TV screens. 
 just 
Now, thousands of discoveries will come from this project, but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access In the last five years, NASA has discovered over 1,000 planetary systems around nearby stars, but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system, and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough 
 just 
Well, if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen, these are the asteroids that are moving fastest, because they're closest to us, closest to Earth. 
well
These are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals, but they're also the asteroids that may one day impact the Earth, like happened 60 million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs, or just at the beginning of the last century, when an asteroid wiped out almost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest, or even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia, 
 just 
So studying the forensics of our solar system doesn't just tell us about the past, it can also predict the future, including our future. 
 just 
Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide, we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system, to asteroids beyond the orbits of Neptune and Mars, to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun. 
 just 
Now, distance and changes in our universe — distance equates to time, as well as changes on the sky. 
well
And the observations were simple: just 24 galaxies and a hand-drawn picture. 
 just 
But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy, the faster it was receding, was enough to give rise to modern cosmology. 
 just 
A second revolution happened 70 years later, when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn't just expanding, it was accelerating, a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets, the faster it moves away. 
 just 
And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae, because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy. 
 just 
So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint, meaning slightly further away, requiring that a universe must not just be expanding, but this expansion must be accelerating, revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy, a component that drives this expansion and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget of our universe today. 
 just 
Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist? 
well
Or, they look at large scales and change how gravity and general relativity work, or they say our universe is just one of many, part of this mysterious multiverse, but all of these ideas, all of these theories, amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy, but all of them consistent with our 42 points. 
 just 
Well, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice, and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair. 
well
One roll of the dice would tell you very little, but the more times you rolled them, the more data you collected, the more confident you would become, not just whether they're loaded or fair, but by how much, and in what way. 
 just 
It took three years to find just 42 supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky. 
 just 
She says that everything you see she owes to spaghetti. 
you see
By the way, the Dalai Lama is someone who has aged beautifully, but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate? 
by the way
You know, for a vain female like myself, it's very hard to age in this culture. 
you know
She says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw — well, she says it in another way — and she has tried them all. 
well
Moderator: I was just wondering if you have anything more to share. 
 just 
Awesome or just merely good that we decided to visit your restaurant again?" 
 just 
The other day, one of my coworkers asked me if I could save that file as a PDF, and I said, "Well, of course," and he said, "Awesome." 
well
 Um, no, it is not, and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.  So in other words, if you have everything, you value nothing. 
 um
Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone. 
 just 
Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829, and earlier today, when you whipped out your smartphone and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich, and you know who you are —  — wasn't that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with iodized silver? 
you know
I mean, come on. Is photography awesome? 
i mean
It's just like that. 
 just 
But it's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower, although that would be awesome. 
 just 
Why is there — Okay. Okay.  This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn. 
okay
I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question? 
i mean
No Einsteins? Okay. 
okay
And by the way, this is what most Americans today believe. 
by the way
Okay? Now that's the equation. 
okay
By the way, even if we have this equation, God + nothing = the world, there's already a problem: Why does God exist? 
by the way
 And so one theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself. 
 just 
Now, if you're a Buddhist, you might want to stop right there, because essentially what you've got is nothing = the world, and by symmetry of identity, that means the world = nothing. Okay? 
okay
And to a Buddhist, the world is just a whole lot of nothing. 
 just 
It's just a big cosmic vacuity. 
 just 
If we let our desires melt away, we'll see the world for what it truly is, a vacuity, nothingness, and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana just enough life to enjoy being dead.  So that's the Buddhist thinking. 
 just 
Well, how about science? 
well
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists, more recently Alex Vilenkin, and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine, Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called "A Universe from Nothing," and Lawrence thinks that he's given — he's a militant atheist, by the way, so he's gotten God out of the picture. 
by the way
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario. 
okay
He said, this model is just equations. 
 just 
So this is a problem, believe it or not, that reflective physicists really think a lot about, and at this point they tend to go metaphysical, say, well, maybe the set of laws that describes our universe, it's just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality, but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality, and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist, they're all out there. 
well
There's also just the crummy, generic realities that aren't special in any way, that are sort of random. 
 just 
But if it's just one of these random, generic realities, there's no further explanation for it. 
 just 
Well —  — the question, "Why does the world exist?" 
well
you know, our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable, because there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans, if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth, and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you there are about 10 to the 10,000th possible humans, genetically. 
you know
We're here. Okay. 
okay
Well then our existence would be guaranteed, because every possible thing exists in that reality, but our choices would be meaningless. 
well
  So anyway, you may say, this puzzle, the mystery of existence, it's just silly mystery-mongering. 
 just 
Bertrand Russell said, "I should say the universe is just there, and that's all." 
 just 
So —  — okay. 
okay
I mean changing the way you click, because clicking is a public act. 
i mean
It's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers. 
 just 
I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up, I put on a lot of makeup, I go on television, I talk about the news. 
okay
I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. 
i mean
There's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on, and that in turn shapes our whole culture. 
you see
First, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. 
you see
I mean, really, same example: if you don't like politicians calling each other names, stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party. 
i mean
Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it. 
 just 
He teetered permanently on the verge of rage, rather like me, as you see. 
you see
We were to be below the radar, so there was no communication, really, between Bageye and us and us and Bageye, and the sound that we most looked forward to, you know when you're a child and you want your father to come home and it's all going to be happy and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening. 
you know
Well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing, which meant he'd gone and would not come back. 
well
You did not just represent yourself. 
 just 
But in conjuring his life, it was okay and very straightforward to portray a Caribbean life in England in the 1970s with bowls of plastic fruit, polystyrene ceiling tiles, settees permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in. 
okay
But in order to fund my education, he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff, so my father would fund my education by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car, and that was made even more tricky because my father, that's not his car by the way. 
by the way
But it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police, and we were stopped a lot by the police, and I was impressed by the way that my father dealt with the police. 
by the way
The Caribbean people came to this country with a five-year plan: they would work, some money, and then go back, but the five years became 10, the 10 became 15, and before you know it, you're changing the wallpaper, and at that point, you know you're here to stay. 
you know
Now, when you go back home, if you see a barren piece of land, do remember that it can be a potential forest. 
you see
We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms that bring people into clinics, but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins. 
 just 
She went back not just once, but twice more. 
 just 
She went back and forth, in and out of hospitals and clinics, just like she had done in years past, trying to seek relief but still coming up short. 
 just 
We're going to order some medications for your symptoms, but I also want to refer you to a specialist, if that's okay." 
okay
And I said, "Veronica, actually, the specialist I'm talking about is someone I call a community health worker, someone who, if it's okay with you, can come to your home and try to understand what's going on with those water leaks and that mold, trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms, and if required, that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer, 
okay
Well, quite simply, it started with that question: "Veronica, where do you live?" 
well
Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?" 
 just 
Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare, usually says, well, let's look at your genes, let's look at how you're behaving. 
well
It turns out, it doesn't really work when we just limit ourselves that worldview. 
 just 
The problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there. 
 just 
But we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now, by all accounts, and that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I said, you know what, we need to train and make more upstreamists. 
you know
What is most compelling is that every day, every week, I hear stories just like Veronica's. 
 just 
Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of, and more importantly, if there are barriers that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you and I'm saying I think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or I don't have access to transportation, or there's a park that's way too far, so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice to go and jog, if those problems exist, 
 just 
Health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon. 
 just 
No, you seem to be thinking clearly, and your vision is perfectly sharp. 
you see
The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired; everything else is just fine. 
 just 
Okay, let's try another one, starting from the bottom and going through the top. 
okay
Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course. 
okay
The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity, that is, where neurons are firing. 
 just 
When they get active, they need increased blood flow to supply that activity, and lucky for us, blood flow control to the brain is local, so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there get active and start firing, then blood flow increases just right there. 
 just 
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards, but at the time I thought it was beautiful. 
 just 
Well, the easiest way is to just do the experiment again. 
well
Is it really specialized just for face recognition? 
 just 
Well, maybe not, right? 
well
But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures. 
 just 
Patient: Okay. 
okay
Patient: Nothing. Neurologist: Nothing? Okay. 
okay
Patient: You just turned into somebody else. 
 just 
Okay, now as you can see, the surface of the brain is all folded up. 
okay
There's another one out on the outside surface again where there's a couple more face regions as well. 
well
Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit, here's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago, when you hear sounds with pitch, like these. 
 just 
   Okay. Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech. 
okay
Okay, now let's look at these same regions. 
okay
Well, I'm wondering about that too, and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions. 
well
So it wasn't a food area, it was just a region that liked colors and shapes. 
 just 
Well, I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I've been describing, we also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along. 
well
In fact, we've shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all — well, of the seven that we've tested. 
well
What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions, but the simple fact that we have selective, specific components of mind and brain in the first place. I mean, it could have been otherwise. 
i mean
This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States, just about a century ago. 
 just 
But she would often just shrug it off, tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta, and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about. 
 just 
I just didn't really know how. 
 just 
This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan, and it was open between 1908 and 1948, just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area. 
 just 
So in the course of just a few weeks, tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit, and since that time, we've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world. 
 just 
Here's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line's site, and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next 10 years. 
 just 
So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city, and invite people into this warm underground space. 
you see
What you see there is the years passing in seconds. 
you see
Rains all over the world. What do you see? 
you see
What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon. 
you see
Do you know how much that is? 
you know
We, scientists -- You see that I'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other. 
you see
There are other factors as well. 
well
You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on Earth, here in the Amazon, because the plants take care of this characteristic as well. 
well
I heard that, and my eyes welled up and I went, "Oh, my! 
well
Some months later, I met him at another event and said, "Davi, how did you know that if the forest was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?" 
you know
This is a need the previous speaker pointed out: We need to see things -- I mean, we, Western society, which is becoming global, civilized -- we need to see. 
i mean
Each color you see is a tree species. 
you see
What you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world. 
you see
There are TED Talks about it. I won't talk much longer, but each person in this room, including myself, has 100 trillion of these micromachines in their body, so that we can enjoy well-being. 
well
That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask, in the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden. 
you see
You see, deaths from natural disasters in the world, you can see it from this graph here, from 1900 to 2000. 
you see
The world has been much, much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this, you know. 
you know
Well, we asked the Swedes like this, and that gives you a hint, doesn't it? 
well
Well, congratulations, you're twice as good as the Swedes, but you don't need me — So how come? I think it's like this, that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties. 
well
Well, it's very clear that poverty here was almost halved, and in U.S., when we asked the public, only five percent got it right. 
well
  That little, just a few of you! 
 just 
There must be preconceived ideas, you know. 
you know
Look at the Swedish result: you know what the right answer is. 
you know
Well, it's me. It's me. 
well
 You see, the problem is not that people don't read and listen to the media. 
you see
Actually, it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well. 
well
Well, I like schools, but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews, because they learned something when they went to school, and now they describe this world to the students and those books, of course, that are printed are outdated in a world that changes. 
well
What happens next is news, okay? 
okay
Okay, this was good evolutionarily, but now when it comes to the worldview, it is the exact reason why it's upside down. 
okay
Okay, I gather those facts. 
okay
Okay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it? 
okay
Okay? Don't go for the worse. 
okay
Okay? If you feel unsure, go for "the most people are in the middle." 
okay
No — well, yes, but they are not so important in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying. 
well
And hopefully we can turn your world around and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay? 
okay
But this has changed, okay? 
okay
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved? 
you see
I used those five years for the next 20 years with the same speed, just as an experiment what might actually happen. 
 just 
These are just projections of GDP per capita into the future. 
 just 
 So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here to talk to you today about, though, truth and lies, fiction and reality. 
you know
 I play sports at a four-year-old level, so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones, and then got hot, and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting —  — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life. 
 just 
In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women, but, you know, four-year-olds — you take what you can get in Berkeley, California. 
you know
She would just take her fruit, her mom packed her a melon every day, and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks and pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley, you can't do that, you have to eat the fruit." 
 just 
And I was like, "Well, when you throw the fruit in the ivy, pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons," which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children. 
well
And —  — she went trudging through the ivy, and then her eyes just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head, and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her, and one of the kids was like, "Hey, why is there a sticker on this?" 
 just 
And Riley knew she didn't grow a melon in seven days, but she also knew that she did, and it's a weird place, but it's not just a place that kids can get to. 
 just 
It's not just kids who can get there. 
 just 
Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment, even though 221B is just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address. 
 just 
I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world, which is — I would always just open people's closet doors.  I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet, and there was not a secret magical land there. 
 just 
You see, this place was zoned retail, and in San Francisco, they were not going to give us a variance, and so the writer who founded it, a writer named Dave Eggers, to come into compliance with code, he said, "Fine, I'm just going to build a pirate supply store." 
you see
Or eyes, also in lots of colors, just glass eyes, depending on how you want to deal with that situation. 
 just 
They're from all eras, including just the 1980s, that guy on the end, he's from the very recent past. 
 just 
It looked like he had just murdered somebody, which it was not out of the question for this particular architect, and we didn't know what to do. 
 just 
So we just put that sign on it that said, "Out of order. Come back yesterday."  And that ended up being a better joke than slushies, so we just left it there forever. 
 just 
There's a quarterly that's published with just writing that's done by the kids who come every day after school, and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses. 
 just 
There's a term called metafiction, and that's just stories about stories, and meta's having a moment now. 
 just 
It's when an actor will turn to the audience and say, "I am an actor, these are just rafters." 
 just 
And here's just one example. 
 just 
And you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll send you a whale. 
 just 
  So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm —  — that says that due to a change in customs laws, their whale has been held up in Sognefjord, which is a very lovely fjord, and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord and Norwegian food for a little while. It digresses. 
 just 
And when you call and leave him a message, you just, on the outgoing message, it's just whale sounds and then a beep, which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound. 
 just 
It's just that I've been so busy because school started, as you might not know, probably, since you're a whale, you don't know, and I'm calling you to just say, to wish you a merry Christmas. 
 just 
MB: I actually got Nico, I hadn't heard from in 18 months, and he just left a message two days ago. 
 just 
His voice is completely different, but he put his babysitter on the phone, and she was very nice to Randolph as well. 
well
If you're wealthy, you live there, if you're poor, you live there, but high density it is, and it's not just Asia. 
 just 
Now, the growth of China is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, Just 25 years ago, the developing countries, the poorer countries of the world, were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people, they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. 
 just 
And we couldn't just turn it off. 
 just 
We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, the economic, or structural, transformation. 
well
The cities that already are there, well established, we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities, and make it easier, encourage more people, to live closer to the center. 
well
I remember the smogs well. 
well
Not just California — the incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of 400 million people who don't have electricity in India. 
 just 
Do the first one well, the structural, the second one on the climate becomes much easier. 
well
And it's not just stopping deforestation. 
 just 
We do understand how to manage those well. 
well
We can have better growth, better climate, a better world. We can make, by managing those two transformations well, the next 100 years the best of centuries. 
well
Okay, think about it. 
okay
Now, the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more, more of the same thing we were looking at. 
 just 
Well, to answer that question, let's think about what information looked like, physically looked like in the past. 
well
If we wanted to know in the 1500s where Martin Luther was, we would have to follow him at all times, maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell, and record it, but now think about what it looks like today. 
well
The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel, tries to stream off, but the car recognizes that a non-approved driver is behind the wheel, and maybe the engine just stops, unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say, "Hey, I have authorization to drive." Great. 
 just 
Well, think about it. 
well
Now, there are dark sides to big data as well. 
well
And that person's job, as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person, is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. 
well
We are just at the outset of the big data era, and honestly, we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. 
 just 
It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency. 
 just 
I was afraid if I told them the truth, that they would die in terror, in fear, just grasping for those last moments of life. 
 just 
But along the way, I've learned that it's not just the technical side, but there's also this thing called the culture of crap. 
 just 
 If, well, I guess you know what I mean. 
well
And this is not just a piece of trivia, but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem. 
 just 
So you ask yourself, how can we solve this and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets for these two and a half billion? 
 just 
And the answer is, it's just not possible. 
 just 
In some of these areas, there's not enough water, there's no energy, it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems, and if you don't build it right, you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river, just like what's happening in many cities in the developing world. 
 just 
We start with a human interface, and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored, transported, treated and reused — and not just disposal but reuse. 
 just 
Well, I'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure. 
well
They're recruited from the poorest, most broken places on our planet by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need, that they will practice where most doctors don't, in places not only poor but oftentimes dangerous, carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets, their home ground. 
 just 
Hundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response, but when they got there, they found a bigger disaster: whole communities with no healthcare, doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff, and just too many babies dying before their first birthday. 
 just 
Even so, in Cuba, the music, the food, the smells, just about everything was different, so faculty became family, ELAM home. 
 just 
First, they just don't have enough doctors, and where they do, their distribution is skewed against the poor, because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources. 
 just 
In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector, where most poor people are treated, not enough political will, not enough resources, not enough anything — just too many patients with no care. 
 just 
She is well trained, can be counted on, and shares the face and culture of her patients, and she deserves our support surely, because whether by subway, mule, or canoe, she is teaching us to walk the walk. 
well
Here's what I mean by that. 
i mean
They said, "We look for employees who are great with our customers, who empower their teams, who negotiate effectively, who are able to manage conflict well, and are overall great communicators." 
well
So I asked, "Well, what about people who understand your business, where it's going, and their role in taking it there? 
well
Well, there are primarily three reasons in the career success advice given to women? 
well
Well, there are primarily two ways. 
well
Well, this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience. 
well
Well, for women, the answer is obvious: we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we're people who understand our businesses, where they're headed, and our role in taking it there. 
well
And executives know this very well, and yet only 37 percent, according to a recent Conference Board report, believe that they have that strategic alignment in place. 
well
And if you think about what I've just shared, that you have situations where at least 50 percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business, where it's headed, and their role in taking it there, it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low, which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this. 
 just 
Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. 
well
Well, I was surprised. I did not know this. 
well
 Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it? 
well
 Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it? 
well
And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older, 11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that. 
 just 
It has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill, the race between education and technology, globalization, probably more unequal access to skills in the U.S., where you have very good, very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good, so very unequal access to skills, and also an unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the United States, which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education. 
 just 
So let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part. 
 just 
Then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the 20th century, and in the recent decade, you can see that the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe, and this is the first fact I just talked about. 
 just 
Okay, so that's fact number one, and that's very important for what follows. 
okay
If people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons, you know, to be able to consume when they are old, then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality. 
you know
So there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data. 
 just 
So this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths, assuming zero tax, and you can just reinvest one fifth. 
 just 
And in a way, this was the very foundation of society, because r bigger than g was what allowed holders of wealth and assets to live off their capital income and to do something else in life than just to care about their own survival. 
 just 
You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan, you had five percent growth rate largely due to reconstruction, and also due to very large demographic growth, the Baby Boom Cohort effect. 
you know
Well, we are very far from this, and from now, what's going on in the real estate sector, the energy sector, is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share. 
well
Just when you feel some people get too wealthy, you just expropriate them. 
 just 
Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions, because it's impressive how you're in command of your data, of course, but basically what you suggest is growing wealth concentration is kind of a natural tendency of capitalism, and if we leave it to its own devices, it may threaten the system itself, so you're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that redistribute wealth, including the ones we just saw: 
 just 
Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think if you look back through time, the history of income, wealth and taxation is full of surprise. 
well
TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy that this book is stimulating debate. 
well
Now, just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it, every cell also produces waste as a byproduct, and the clearance of that waste that each organ has to solve. 
 just 
I mean, the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared. 
i mean
Well, that seemingly mundane question is where our group first jumped into this story, and what we found as we dove down into the brain, down among the neurons and the blood vessels, was that the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance, it was really unexpected. 
well
But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain, they don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF. 
 just 
But our most surprising finding was that all of this, everything I just told you about, with all this fluid rushing through the brain, it's only happening in the sleeping brain. 
 just 
Yet in the same animal, if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep, what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain, and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep, the brain cells themselves seem to shrink, opening up spaces in between them, allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out. 
 just 
Now, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance, but I haven't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy. 
 just 
But our democracy is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years. 
 just 
But we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information, but from doing something with it. 
 just 
Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences, one on top of each other, but that our healthy and robust public debate So DemocracyOS is about persuading and being persuaded. 
 just 
They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they'll be willing to listen as well. 
well
Now, there's all kinds of things to say about that mentality, the first of which is that the people who say that, who say that privacy isn't really important, they don't actually believe it, and the way you know that they don't actually believe it is that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter, with their actions, they take all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy. 
you know
There's a reason why we seek that out, and our reason is that all of us — not just terrorists and criminals, all of us — have things to hide. 
 just 
It isn't just a reflexive movement like breathing air or drinking water. 
 just 
This is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline. 
 just 
The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault realized that that model could be used not just for prisons but for every institution that seeks to control human behavior: schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces. 
 just 
The most iconic work of literature about surveillance and privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984," which we all learn in school, and therefore it's almost become a cliche. 
well
In fact, whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance, people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable, and what they say is, "Oh, well in '1984,' there were monitors in people's homes, they were being watched at every given moment, and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face." 
well
That is an actual fundamental misapprehension of the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984." 
well
Here is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith, described the surveillance system that they faced: "There was, of course, no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment." 
well
There are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well. 
well
Glenn Greenwald: You know, I think one of the things that happens is that people's courage in this regard gets contagious, and so although I and the other journalists with whom I was working were certainly aware of the risk — the United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn't appreciate it when you disclose thousands of their secrets on the Internet at will — 
you know
seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked, knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life or that his life would unravel, inspired me and inspired other journalists and inspired, I think, people around the world, including future whistleblowers, to realize that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well. 
well
GG: You know, I'm sure that's something for a team of psychologists to examine.  I don't really know. The reason I think that, one of the important objectives that he actually had, one of his, I think, most important tactics, was that he knew that one of the ways to distract attention from the substance of the revelations would be to try and personalize the focus on him, and for that reason, he stayed out of the media. 
you know
At what point will you think, well, actually, we've succeeded in moving the dial? 
well
GG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist is very simple, which is to make sure that every single document that's newsworthy and that ought to be disclosed and that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place end up uncovered. 
well
 If you wanted to, and I know you're just playing devil's advocate, but if you wanted to sell secrets to another country, which he could have done and become extremely rich doing so, the last thing you would do is take those secrets and give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them, because it makes those secrets worthless. 
 just 
Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '80s, and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before, and if those numbers are bad at the national level, at the level of our cities, they are just dismal. 
 just 
The city of L.A., a city of four million people, elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes. 
 just 
Well, I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like, then we really have to change the decision-making processes that have given us the results that we have right now. 
well
They have also, to a lesser extent, invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them, just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice: I had to be in bed by 8 p.m., but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. 
 just 
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl, Bia, to your right, and Bia was just 11 years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. 
 just 
These stories make me happy, but not just because they have happy endings. 
 just 
Most of these deaths are preventable, and that doesn't just make me sad, it makes me angry, and it makes me determined. 
 just 
So now just take a minute. 
 just 
Why don't you just shake their hands. 
 just 
So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet?  They don't look so pretty anymore, right? 
 just 
Well, statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet, And the same way, we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets, running water, and soap available, it's the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high. 
well
Well, in Mayank's family, soap is used for bathing, soap is used for laundry, soap is used for washing dishes. 
well
Just as personal computers or the Internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship, politics or education, recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well, and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches. 
well
And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer, because as you know, cancer is a disease of altered gene expression. 
you know
And also, all microRNAs are very similar to each other, with just tiny differences. 
 just 
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test, a lab technician extracts a total RNA, which is quite simple today, and puts it in a standard 96-well plate like this one. 
well
Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign, that is looking for a specific microRNA, acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample, and when it does, it will shine with green color. 
well
This entire process lasts around 60 minutes, but when the process is over, wells that shine are matched with the specific microRNAs and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine. 
well
This inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. 
 just 
It would be as if the entire population of Germany, 80 million people, would flee to the United States in just three years. 
 just 
Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries, and only a small proportion, as you see, have moved on to Europe. 
well
It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan. 
 just 
You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state. 
 just 
Well far from it. 
well
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats, risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe. 
 just 
This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized — most of the people drowned — and he told us, "Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you, where nobody humiliates you, and where nobody kills you." 
 just 
Well, I think that should be the minimum. 
well
But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive. 
 just 
We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end. 
 just 
It made its way up his neck, cutting off his ability to breathe, and stopped just beneath the eyes. 
 just 
But he told me he felt tingles, sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin. 
 just 
And here's what he said, of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. 
well
He said, Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. 
well
There's also the speed at which it moves, and the many varieties of data types, and here are just a few examples: images, text, video, audio. 
 just 
 So then you have to think about, well, how do people talk about electronic cigarettes? 
well
And what I admire and appreciate about this project, aside from the fact, including the fact that it's based on real human need, is that it's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance. And so it's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation, because let's face it, of taking any amount of data, no matter how small, and screwing it up. 
 just 
And at this point, you might be thinking, "Okay, Susan, we get it, you can take data, you can make it mean anything." 
okay
So if we are to unlock the power of data, we don't have to go blindly into Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future, or Huxley's vision of a trivial one, or some horrible cocktail of both. 
well
And I remember feeling how just one good leader could make such a big difference in Africa. 
 just 
You see, all these countries I lived in, the coups d'état and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia and in Zimbabwe, contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen in Botswana and in South Africa of good leadership. 
you see
But if there's one thing you take away from my talk today, it is this: In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world, the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere else, and here's why. 
 just 
So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in: When societies have strong institutions, the difference that one good leader can make is limited, but when you have weak institutions, then just one good leader can make or break that country. 
 just 
I think I'd like to stay in it forever."  Well, you just can. 
well
He'll say, "Okay, yes, sir, is there anything else I can do for you?" 
okay
One billion people will need jobs in Africa, so if we don't grow our economies fast enough, we're sitting on a ticking time bomb, not just for Africa but for the entire world. 
 just 
And she's just turned 18. 
 just 
 And who would have thought that you would have been able to build a multimillion-dollar business employing so many people just from bat poo? 
 just 
Do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance, or that God gives them to us? 
 just 
But they won't just learn academics. 
 just 
But what we're doing is just one group of institutions. 
 just 
I had that moment right about the 10-year mark, and luckily, that's also when I learned that this idea actually exists, and it might be just what the aid system needs. 
 just 
Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor? 
well
Today, the logic behind aid is too often, well, we do at least some good. 
well
I believe most aid is better than just throwing money out of a plane. 
 just 
If you look at their patent carefully, especially if you have any engineering background or talent, you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is not perfectly adequate.  Doctor Ivan Schwab in California is one of the people, one of the main people, who helped answer the question, "Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?" 
you see
Now, I hope you will agree with me that these things I've just described to you, each of them, deserves some kind of prize.  And that's what they got, each of them got an Ig Nobel prize. 
 just 
The prizes are based on just one criteria. It's very simple. 
 just 
Well, you get several things. 
well
They ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars. The man responsible, who runs the national bank there, by the way, won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics. The other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony, which happens at Harvard University. 
by the way
I am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medical-related prizes we've given. 
 just 
They, in these papers, explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies, how to minimize the chance that when you perform a colonoscopy, your patient will explode.  Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan one of the authors, flew in from Paris to the ceremony, where he explained the history of this, that in the 1950s, when colonoscopies were becoming a common technique for the first time, people were figuring out how to do it well. 
well
And I look at this, and I go, well, there are tools to go deeper, longer and further: submarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving. 
well
It's like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together. 
well
Of course, just like any neighbor, after a while, if they get tired, the goliath grouper barks at us, and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second. 
 just 
For us, it's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone. 
 just 
Now, this wasn't just about adventure. 
 just 
In this particular case, we were using a PAM, or, let me just see if I can get this straight, a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer. 
 just 
The Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer, or PAM, gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change-related issues. 
well
Well, within that 31 days, we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers on each one of these topics. 
well
But what this gives us is the foresight to look at and analyze in scientific and engineering terms some of the most amazing behavior that the human eye just can't pick up, such as this manta shrimp trying to catch its prey, within about .3 seconds. 
 just 
But now we can see things such as these Christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can't capture, or in this case, a fish throwing up grains of sand. 
 just 
And I dream of the day that we have underwater cities, and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries of adventure and knowledge, and we share that knowledge with others out there, we can solve all sorts of problems. 
 just 
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise. 
 just 
Throughout this time, I also studied many laws, I talked to many people, I read up on many cases, and I found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in Afghanistan, but it's a global problem. 
 just 
And it's not just that simple; you can't just throw money at this problem and think that it's going to disappear. 
 just 
So in a single image, you can really see the scale of this event — just the number of people, the colors, the banners. 
 just 
You just can't consider this insignificant. 
 just 
For many good reasons, it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras. 
 just 
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash. 
well
You just turn it on and you point in the direction that you want to fly. 
 just 
So I just shifted its position. 
 just 
 So my question now to you is, well, it's a nice solution, it's very accessible, it's safe. 
well
I just met you on a bus, and we would really like to get to know each other, but I've got to get off at the next stop, so you're going to tell me three things about yourself that just define you as a person, three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are, three things that just get to your very essence. 
 just 
And in fact, I thought, well, if you have to have cancer, it's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it. 
well
Like, maybe I should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket, because I'm on the force. 
 just 
So I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked, which was amazingly convenient, and I had chemotherapy and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in, and so before I say another word, let me just say right now, this is the fake one.  I have found that I need to get that out of the way, because I'll see somebody go "Oh, I know it's this one." 
 just 
So now you know. 
you know
So the other thing I learned was that I don't have to take on "cancer survivor" as my identity, but, boy, are there powerful forces pushing me to do just that. 
 just 
So at dinner that night, our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head, and say, "You know, Deb, now you're really going to learn what's important. 
you know
 And then after my treatment, it just felt like everyone was telling me what my experience was going to mean. 
 just 
It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God, this is just taking over my life. 
 oh 
Many years ago, I had a patient, just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff, and so it was something of a shock to us to realize that he had no friends. 
 just 
One of the other things that I loved seeing patients a year, or even several years after their treatment, because it was just really cool to see how they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them. 
 just 
So I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was NED: No Evidence of Disease. 
 just 
Many, many years before, I had been fired from a job that I loved, and I would not stop talking about my innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt, until finally, just like this woman, people were walking away from me, until I finally realized I wasn't just processing my feelings, I was feeding them. 
 just 
What if there were no survivors, meaning, what if people decided to just claim their trauma as an experience instead of taking it on as an identity? 
 just 
I just want you all to know that I am really glad that we are on this bus together, and this is my stop. 
 just 
So this is Anna Hazare, and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting-edge digital activist in the world today. 
well
So the first thing he did is he said to people, "Okay, why don't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption?" 
okay
Okay, that's pretty respectable. 
okay
People leave missed calls all the time: If you're running late for a meeting and you just want to let them know that you're on the way, you leave them a missed call. 
 just 
If you're dating someone and you just want to say "I miss you" you leave them a missed call. 
 just 
Well, the reason of course is that associated with making calls and sending texts. 
well
I hope you see the resemblance. 
you see
Well, unsurprisingly, that campaign was wholly unsuccessful. 
well
Is the moral of this story, you know what, the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone? 
you know
Well, I would argue that there's actually more to it than that. 
well
I'd argue that in the last 20 years, something more fundamental has changed than just new tech. 
 just 
This is Airbnb, which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate. 
 just 
And you see a whole set of characteristics that you can trace, whether it's in media or politics or education. 
you see
I assure you that having a social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio. 
 just 
These were just like someone's garage idea a few years ago, and now they're disrupting entire industries. 
 just 
Well, if you're there thinking, in old power, this won't happen to us. 
well
Then just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclopædia Britannica. 
 just 
Is new power kind of just riding the wave to glory? 
 just 
So the big question about the future of new power, in my view, is: Will that old power just emerge? 
 just 
So will new power elites just become old power and squeeze? 
 just 
Finally, think about new power being more than just an entity that scales things that make us have slightly better consumer experiences. 
 just 
We have major structural problems in the world today from the kinds of mass participation and peer coordination that these new power players know so well how to generate. 
well
And not just that. There's James. He's an architect and he's a professor, and he loves place-making, and place-making is when you have those mini-plazas and those urban walkways and where they're dotted with art, where people draw and come up and talk sometimes. 
 just 
But here's the icing on the cake: It's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that's probably your greatest, as an institution or an individual. 
 just 
And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs. 
 just 
In just a few years, we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun, but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons. 
 just 
But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements, I just want to share with you four key insights. 
 just 
This is something that veteran politicians understand, but that civil society groups generally do not do very well. 
well
In a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York, we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market are criminal gangs and cartels. 
 just 
They inundated our campaign with their propaganda, that as you know, links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy. 
you know
Here is what I mean: We could prove that in just one year, we saved more than 5,000 lives. 
 just 
And the reason, I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia, but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil. 
 just 
Well, we got 331, which is okay, but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them, but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them, and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas. 
well
This person you see here is Giovanni Andres. 
you see
She was very familiar with the territory, so one night, when she was on guard, she just left, and she went to the army, she demobilized, and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to, and we were really touched by this story, so we made a radio spot, and it turns out, by chance, that far away, many, many kilometers north, he heard her on the radio, 
 just 
So we thought, well, we'll use the same strategy. 
well
And somebody, some brilliant person in our team, came back and said, "You know what I noticed? 
you know
This picture that I have here, you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees, and that man you see there with the three stars, he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez. 
you see
What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the Christmas tree operation and all of that said, "That's really good, Christmas trees are really cool, but you know what? We really don't walk anymore. 
you know
And it changed because it makes you think, "Well, if there's a peace process, this is probably going to be over. 
well
And you may be aware of this or not, but there was a World Cup this year, and Colombia played really well, and it was a unifying moment for Colombia. 
well
What do I mean by heterophylly? 
i mean
Well, first of all, they feed us and they also give us the oxygen we breathe, but plants are also the source of important, biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully, because human societies over the millennia, they have developed important knowledge, cultural traditions, and important plant-based medicinal resources. 
well
You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally. 
you know
Now, these four examples are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem, and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity. 
 just 
Let me finish with just one last example. 
 just 
You know why? Because the environment plays in modifying the composition of that plant. 
you know
But you know, there is no such thing as a weed. 
you know
It's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have, but we have to ensure that it has the right to live. 
well
So what to do? Well, an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves. 
well
And by the way, they said, the cost of the land, because it's in the center of the city, is three times more than what social housing can normally afford. 
by the way
Well, a middle-class family lives reasonably well in around 80 square meters, but when there's no money, what the market does is to reduce the size of the house to 40 square meters. 
well
As a building, it could pay for expensive, well-located land, and as a house, it could expand. 
well
Well, how does that building look, typically? 
well
So we thought, well, maybe we have to turn this scheme inside out. 
well
Done well, of course. 
well
There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question. 
well
So it was pretty obvious after this process that, well, we chicken out here and go away because it's too tense, or we go even further in asking, what else is bothering you? 
well
Design's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life. 
 just 
He said, "You know, everybody here would pretty much love to have their houses plastered and painted. 
you know
So we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy, and then we thought we were finished, we were really happy, but still, it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us, and they said, "You know, there's a boy flying the kite, but where is his kite?" 
you know
You know, you have to imagine the kite."  And they said, "No, no, no, we want to see the kite." 
you know
We started looking for funding, but instead, we just ran into questions, like, how many houses are you going to paint? 
 just 
DU: So what we did is we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea, which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art. 
 just 
Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico, Central America, so many other parts of the planet, the global black market estimated at 300 billion dollars a year, prisons packed in the United States and elsewhere, police and military drawn into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights, and ordinary citizens just hope they don't get caught in the crossfire, and meanwhile, more people using more drugs than ever. 
 just 
It's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U.S. 
 just 
I mean, don't forget, we're the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol. 
i mean
Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me, "You can't really cut off the supply. 
well
So then I go back home and I talk to people involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say, "You know, Ethan, you can't really cut off the demand. 
you know
But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese started showing up in my country, working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe, that's when you saw the first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada, driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves. 
 just 
And what was true in my country, is true in so many others as well, with both the origins of these laws and their implementation. 
well
But since today is Tuesday, let me just say that legally regulating and taxing most of the drugs that are now criminalized would radically reduce the crime, violence, corruption and black markets, and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs, and improve public safety, and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes. 
 just 
It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a long-term marriage.  And that just might be a net public health benefit. 
 just 
Look at Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, England, where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical heroin and helping services in medical clinics, and the results are in: Illegal drug abuse and disease and overdoses and crime and arrests all go down, health and well-being improve, taxpayers benefit, and many drug users even put their addictions behind them. 
well
I mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900, and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca-Cola is today. 
i mean
But just imagine the drug war nightmare So the challenges we face today are twofold. 
 just 
So this is what I've dedicated my life to, to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights, where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well, where people who love our drugs, people who hate drugs, 
well
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films 10 years ago, first with a friend, Christophe Abric. 
well
At the time, 10 years ago actually, there was no such project on the Internet, and I guess that's why the project we were making, the Take Away Shows, got quite successful, reaching millions of viewers. 
i guess
Alone, actually, but just with local people, meeting my team, which was absolutely not professional people, on the spot there, going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek. 
 just 
Well, or other drinks, depending on where you are. 
well
Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually, I had no idea about what I would do there. 
well
And I just had one phone number, actually, of one person. 
 just 
Well, I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually — incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya, which is absolutely unknown outside of the region. 
well
I just want to represent them in a beautiful light. 
 just 
I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather, and they're going to be like, "Whoa, my grandfather is as cool as Beyoncé."  It's a really important thing. 
 just 
From jathilan, a popular trance ritual on the island of Java, to Umbanda in the north of Brazil. 
 um
Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance, and I have a question for you, and the question is this: You show up in places like the ones you just have shown us, and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. 
 just 
I mean, you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length, etc. 
i mean
Otherwise, you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning, and so is that the case? 
 just 
I really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer, to not cut all the time from one place to another, to just let the time go. 
 just 
VM: I guess four years ago, four years in my first travel. 
i guess
but Florey and his team figured if they had to use it, they might as well use it on someone who was going to die anyway. 
well
Day four, well on the way to recovery. 
well
So that story didn't end that well, but fortunately for millions of other people, like this child who was treated again in the early 1940s, who was again dying of a sepsis, and within just six days, you can see, recovered thanks to this wonder drug, penicillin. 
well
Now, antibiotics have been used for patients like this, but they've also been used rather frivolously in some instances, for treating someone with just a cold or the flu, which they might not have responded to an antibiotic, and they've also been used in large quantities sub-therapeutically, which means in small concentrations, to make chicken and hogs grow faster. 
 just 
Basically, the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem, because we've now selected for just the resistant bacteria. 
 just 
It's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries, and at the heart of it, you might say, well, isn't this really just a medical issue? 
well
Now, it turns out that there's something fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs, which is that if I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics, not only am I affected but others are affected as well, in the same way as if I choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere, that the costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere, 
well
This is what economists might call a problem of the commons, and the problem of the commons is exactly what we face in the case of antibiotics as well: that we don't consider — and we, including individuals, patients, hospitals, entire health systems — do not consider the costs that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used. 
well
Now, that's a problem that's similar to another area that we all know about, which is of fuel use and energy, and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to local pollution and climate change. 
well
They're related, because if we invest heavily in new oil wells, we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that's going to happen for antibiotics. 
well
Now, this is the game we're playing against the bacteria, except we're not the cheetahs, we're the gazelles, and the bacteria would, just in the course of this little talk, would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant just by selection and trial and error, trying it over and over again. 
 just 
We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down, and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well. 
well
We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well, and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately. 
well
Well, turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work, so that could include improving hospital infection control or vaccinating people, particularly against the seasonal influenza. 
well
And the seasonal flu is probably the biggest driver of antibiotic use, both in this country as well as in many other countries, and that could really help. 
well
Now, there's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well. 
well
We don't want to just throw money at a problem. 
 just 
Well, we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like, right? 
well
Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam. 
well
Well, eventually I learned enough English, and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. 
well
My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well, she had a cough that wouldn't go away, she was short of breath and tired. 
well
Well, I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. 
well
I mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right? 
i mean
But it's not just patients who are scared; doctors are scared too. 
 just 
We don't just have a fear of sickness, we have a sickness of fear. 
 just 
I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital, but everyday people. 
 just 
Well, when we asked people, "What do you want to know about your healthcare?" 
well
Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in, but also our conflicts of interest. 
 just 
Well, times may be hard for everyone, but try telling your patient making 35,000 dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. 
well
Well, how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health, but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end-of-life decisions just might. 
well
Well, two pieces of good news. 
well
Well, she was my doctor, but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street. 
well
Just one generation ago, this was the norm in the U.S. as well. 
well
You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys, that he quit smoking a few years ago, that he says he's a regular churchgoer, but you see him twice a year: once at Easter and once when his mother-in-law comes to town. 
you see
I knew my mother so well. 
well
I understood what her directives meant so well, but I was a physician. 
well
Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy, but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices, to address issues like smoking cessation, blood-pressure management and diabetes control, well, that requires us to establish trust. 
well
It's not a measure of our well-being. 
well
It's a measure of the well-being of society, completely separate from GDP. 
well
Okay, I'm going to show you. 
okay
And then, just for comparison, just for fun, on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita. 
 just 
 Well done! Never been; must go. 
well
So what's going on? Well, look. 
well
And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress and see that it's not just growth alone, it's growth with social progress. 
 just 
And that's what the Social Progress Index does: It reframes the debate about development, not just about GDP alone, but inclusive, sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people's lives. 
 just 
And it's not just about countries. 
 just 
And this is just the beginning, You can create a Social Progress Index for any state, region, city or municipality. 
 just 
Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution, but on their contribution to social progress. 
 just 
Doesn't say a word — just rolls away with it. 
 just 
Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office, and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar. 
okay
 The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar. 
 just 
And a well-run meeting can yield really positive, actionable results. 
well
As a group, we need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi, who just joined? 
 just 
I was just saying, we have a lot of people on the call we'd like to get through, so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in. 
 just 
As a group, we need to decide if — bloop bloop —  Hi, who just joined? 
 just 
A couple of weeks after I put that online, 500,000 people in dozens of countries, I mean dozens of countries, watched this video. 
i mean
It's okay, you're allowed, that's why it's there. 
okay
Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with. 
 just 
People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours. 
 just 
And they just might bring your chair back, too.  No MAS! 
 just 
But that's not just with autistic people, either. 
 just 
When something very exciting happens in my inner world, I've just got to run. 
 just 
They're just the best, and I love them so much and I care about them more than anything else. 
 just 
Well, good afternoon. 
well
Well, I have to tell you, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you so very, very much. 
well
Do you know to date the ALS Association has raised 125 million dollars? 
you know
And one night, I found myself having a beer with Pete, and Pete was looking at me and he just said, "You know, Mom, I don't know, selling group insurance is just not my passion." 
you know
And he said, "You know, oh by the way, Mom, I have to leave early from vacation because my inter-city league team that I play for made the playoffs, and I have to get back to Boston because I can't let my team down. 
 oh 
I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball." 
 just 
And he says, "Well, Pete, we've been looking at all the tests, and I have to tell you, it's not a sprained wrist, it's not a broken wrist, it's not nerve damage in the wrist, it's not an infection, it's not Lyme disease." 
well
Okay, what treatment? Let's go. 
okay
But then our leader, Pete, set the vision, and talked to us just like we were his new team. 
 just 
It just doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of collaboration going on here. 
 just 
And then I turned around and there was about 200 pairs of eyes just staring at me. 
 just 
So for the next two years, we just watched my son be taken away from me, little by little every day. 
 just 
So we knew awareness would lead to funding, we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days. 
 just 
And the ALS patients, you know what their favorite ones are, and their families'? 
you know
Because this misunderstood and underfunded "rare" disease, they just sat and watched people saying it over and over: "ALS, ALS." 
 just 
And those naysayers, let's just talk a couple of stats, shall we? 
 just 
Well, guess what? 
well
 So okay, after all of this ice, we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of ice water over your head, and I really would like to leave you with a couple of things that I'd like you to remember. 
 just 
Would any of you blame me if I just was in the fetal position and pulled the covers over my head every day? 
 just 
"Pete, is that okay?" "Yup." 
okay
And the third thing I want to leave you with: If you ever come across a situation that you see as so unacceptable, I want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it. 
you see
So just like that, the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions. 
 just 
So as you see, your cells sit in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue, the extracellular matrix changes. 
you see
So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue. 
 just 
So that means if you put it onto liver, it turns into something that looks like liver, and if you put it onto skin, it turns into something that looks just like skin. 
 just 
Well, the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can, and so do I, but only if we focus on our cities, especially the most fragile ones. 
well
You see, I've been thinking about this a lot. 
you see
Now, I hope that mayors do one day rule the world, but, you know, the fact is, we don't hear any conversation, really, about what is happening in the South. 
you know
And by South, I mean Latin America, Africa, Asia, where violence in some cases is accelerating, where infrastructure is overstretched, and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality. 
i mean
Most Northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago. 
 just 
Well, yeah, we should. 
well
There's just one problem: These two scourges are still with us. 
 just 
You see, 525,000 people -- men, women, boys and girls -- die violently every single year. 
you see
Well, for one thing, they're young. 
well
Now, it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence. 
 just 
Okay, so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities. 
okay
And those young people I just mentioned, they're more digitally savvy and tech-aware than ever before. 
 just 
But it's not just the cops who are innovating. 
 just 
So this is just a partial sketch of a fast-moving and dynamic and complex situation. 
 just 
I mean, there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time, not least income inequality, poverty, climate change, impunity. 
i mean
Did you know that between one and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to 99 percent of violent crime? 
you know
It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest, and it did this by doubling down on information collection, hot spot mapping, and police reform, and in the process, it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years. 
 just 
When I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s, Medellín was the murder capital of the world, but it changed course, and it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle-class ones through a network of cable cars, of public transport, and first-class infrastructure, and in the process, it dropped homicide by 79 percent in just under two decades. 
 just 
So I have just one question: What are we waiting for? 
 just 
Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis, a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts 12 million people around the world. 
you see
You see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures. 
you see
He said, "Well, then what can you know about healing?" 
well
The shaman looked at him and he said, "You know what? If you have an infection, go to a doctor. 
you know
The top half of the picture, you see where the Indians live. 
you see
Top half wonder drugs, bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows. 
 just 
It's found in the Amazon as well. 
well
Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay. 
you see
These cultures that once danced, made love, sang to the gods, worshipped the forest, all that's left is an imprint in stone, as you see here. 
you see
His people, his company, and other companies like them killed, massacred, tortured, butchered Indians like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide. 
you see
And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain just to the east of the picture. 
 just 
Her brother was murdered by the state-sponsored militia, and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party. 
 just 
Mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped to document human rights violations using cameras. 
 just 
I joined the Israeli army just after the first intifada, the first Palestinian uprising, and I served in one of the hard-minded, toughest, aggressive infantry units, and I got the biggest gun in my platoon. 
 just 
Here you see him blindfolded and handcuffed. 
you see
He is okay. 
okay
Where I used to work before, in the West Bank, one can take a camera out, most likely not going to get shot, but in places we wanted to work, just try to pull a phone out, and you're dead — literally dead. 
 just 
["Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted"] Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently about fear and about the odds of success, and indeed the odds of survival. 
 just 
Unlike Scott's expedition, there were just two of us, and we set off from the coast of Antarctica in October last year, dragging everything ourselves, a process Scott called "man-hauling." 
 just 
I remember just wanting to lie down and quit. 
 just 
We fell through more times than I can remember, usually just putting a ski or a boot through the snow. 
 just 
But I'm also standing here saying, you know what, that cliche about the journey being more important than the destination? 
you know
Right now, I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets. 
 just 
Last year, we just hit over 600,000, so half of my number. 
 just 
By the way, I don't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area. 
by the way
Now, to close the gap, Germany has to significantly increase migration, get many more women in the workforce, increase retirement age — by the way, we just lowered it this year — and all these measures at once. 
 just 
China, with its former one-child policy, will be hit, as well as Brazil and Russia. 
well
Right now, we are just at the turning point. 
 just 
I mean, look, every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans. 
i mean
You know, we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant. 
you know
Well, today's human hospitals, increasingly, are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology. 
well
Well, I'm trying these days. 
well
Well, despite all of this promise, unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large. 
well
Wow. Brilliant idea, except this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day. 
 just 
Thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this.  This was also a huge success in terms of social media. 
 just 
So just a week after the Bergen Railway, we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show. 
 just 
They're just tools used in a different context. 
 just 
He's doing fine. Everything went well. 
well
If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June 2011, they will look like this, and as a TV producer, it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it. 
you see
We have made 12 hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal, and we have made another train ride with the northern railway, and because this we couldn't do live, we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way. 
 just 
You have to just take your cameras with you. 
 just 
So this is actually the whole running order for Hurtigruten, 134 hours, just written on one page. 
 just 
But more than that, increasingly, local police departments are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing, but of every plate that passes them by, resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where Americans have gone. 
 just 
Did you know this was happening? 
you know
Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information? 
okay
The reason it's happening is because, as the cost of storing this data has plummeted, the police departments simply hang on to it, just in case it could be useful someday. 
 just 
The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police departments are doing it. 
 just 
Now, I'm here on the green side, down on the far right where the geeks are, and TEDx also is down on the far right.  Now, on the other side of the network, you tend to have primarily African-American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are, but just to give some sense, the green part of the network we call Smalltimore, for those of us that inhabit it, 
 just 
But in the middle, you see that there's something that connects the two communities together, and that's sports. 
you see
You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco. 
you see
You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community. 
well
Well, I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct. 
well
Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit. 
well
And just like that, another of their decisions was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots. 
 just 
It became enormous in just a few months. 
 just 
And while I thought everything was perfect, my team -- which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time -- thought everything was going so well, we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us. 
well
I truly believe, to create women leaders, there's only one thing you have to do: Just let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader. 
 just 
These women you see here, they have strong skills and potential to be leaders. 
you see
But then while we were thinking everything was going well, once again everything was fantastic, we found our next setback: A lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife. 
well
She's speaking more, she's making decisions -- oh my gosh, she's handling everything in the house. 
 oh 
They stopped them from coming to the centers, and this time, we were like, okay, time for strategy two. 
okay
It is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan to replicate the idea and to find even more innovative ways to unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan. 
 just 
I mean, this story, in many ways, just seems beyond belief. 
 just 
So I guess one question: This is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women -- how much of the current success depends on you, the force of this magnetic personality? 
i guess
I would just give the inspiration and that's my job. 
 just 
CA: I love that when you talked about your team in the talk, I mean, you were all 18 at the time. 
i mean
KB: This question has come to me a lot of times before, and I feel like the word "fear" just comes to me and then drops, but there is one fear that I have that is different from that. 
 just 
I mean, I am not a fashion person, believe me. 
i mean
CA: Well, it's been incredible to have you here. 
well
But it's not just because of our dashing personalities, superior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases. 
 just 
Of all of the available women in the U.K., all Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him, somebody in the right age range, somebody with a university degree, somebody he's likely to get on well with, somebody who's likely to be attractive, somebody who's likely to find him attractive. 
well
Now, just to put that into perspective, that's about 400 times fewer than the best estimates of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are. 
 just 
Because I know, just as well as all of you do, that love doesn't really work like that. 
well
Okay, so Top Tip #1: How to win at online dating. 
okay
And the reason why is that it's not just straightforward looks that are important. 
 just 
That's much better than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. 
 just 
Well, why would you bother humiliating yourself, let's be honest? 
well
Okay, Top Tip #2: How to pick the perfect partner. 
okay
Now generally, it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all. 
 just 
 Thanks a lot, Jane. What do you know about love? 
you know
So the question is then, how do you know when is the right time to settle down given all the people that you can date in your lifetime? 
you know
In my experience at least, I find that typically people don't much like being recalled years after being passed up for somebody else, or that's just me. 
 just 
So the math says then that what you should do in the first 37 percent of your dating window, you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential. 
 just 
Okay, another risk is, let's imagine, instead, that the first people that you dated in your first 37 percent are just incredibly dull, boring, terrible people. 
 just 
Now, that's okay, because you're in your rejection phase, so thats fine, you can reject them. 
okay
But then imagine, the next person to come along is just marginally less boring, dull and terrible than everybody that you've seen before. 
 just 
Okay, so this method doesn't give you a 100 percent success rate, but there's no other possible strategy that can do any better. 
okay
I think this is conclusive proof, if ever it were needed, that everybody's brains are prewired to be just a little bit mathematical. 
 just 
Okay, so that was Top Tip #2. 
okay
Okay, so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them. 
okay
Gottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation and recorded, well, everything you can think of. 
well
Whereas bad relationships, by which I mean, probably going to get divorced, they found themselves getting into a spiral of negativity. 
i mean
Now just by using these very simple ideas, Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couple was going to get divorced with a 90 percent accuracy. 
 just 
And the results that they found I think are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting. 
 just 
Now of course, it takes bit more than just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship. 
 just 
Because for me, equations and symbols aren't just a thing. 
 just 
So I hope that perhaps, for just a couple of you, a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have a little bit more love for mathematics. 
 just 
Tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that I want to share with you this afternoon: that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game-changer in journalism, in activism, and as I see it, in the political discourse as well. 
well
But to make a long story short, I had entered that protest as the editor-in-chief of a well-established printed magazine where I'd worked for 11 years, and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas, I left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways of sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there, actually. 
well
And I realized that we had a frontier here, a very important one, that it was just a matter of changing the perspective, and the web could be actually used, already used, as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical TV channel, TV network, and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment, even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue, so if it happens, bear with me please, 
 just 
They were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city. 
 just 
So the police violence against them started to grow as well. 
well
out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone, and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non-mediated power of exchanging experiences and dialogue, empowers them to question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see. 
 just 
They said things like, "I love a challenge," or, "You know, I was hoping this would be informative." 
you know
On the left, you see the fixed mindset students. 
you see
And here are just a few examples. 
 just 
Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare, like physicians, dentists, podiatrists, hair stylists, massage therapists and much more. 
well
So next time you see one, recognize them as a vital part of our society. 
you see
Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other. 
 just 
Erin McKean: Exactly! You know how to make the plural of wug. 
you know
You never had to be taught this rule, you just understand it. 
 just 
Once you know how hats work, nobody has to tell you, "Don't wear hats on your feet." 
you know
And I think that is, well, stupid. 
well
["Go rob other people"]  Linguists call this borrowing, but we never give the words back , so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing. 
 just 
So go ahead and make words like "duckface," just don't make duckface. 
 just 
So what do I mean by color changes? 
i mean
What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin, magnified 100 times so that they become visible. 
you see
And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse, but also to actually recover our heart rates, and measure our heart rates. 
 just 
We can do it essentially with other videos as well. 
well
So I just took a short clip from "Batman Begins" here just to show Christian Bale's pulse. 
 just 
 And you know, presumably he's wearing makeup, the lighting here is kind of challenging, but still, just from the video, we're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well. 
well
But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color, but also tiny motions, and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras will change not only if the color of the object changes, but also if the object moves. 
 just 
And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it. 
 just 
And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs, and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany, and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth You can also do some art with it. 
you know
We just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world, and then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it. 
 just 
There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it, but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that video. 
 just 
And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here, a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer. 
 just 
That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras. 
 just 
 And we can recover speech as well. 
well
Michael Rubinstein: And here's that speech again recovered just from this video of that same bag of chips. 
 just 
MR: And now, 137 years later, we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras, and we can even do that when the camera is 15 feet away from the object, behind soundproof glass. 
 just 
We've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology. 
 just 
Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here, and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website, try it out yourself, and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions. 
you see
So, let's save the whales again, but this time, let's not just do it for their sake. 
 just 
In 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours, a social enterprise that aims to connect people, with two Jewish friends, by the way, and what we'll do, the model we did, for example, in Jerusalem, we would have two tour guides, one Israeli and one Palestinian, guiding the trips together, telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives. 
by the way
By the way, this is my mother. She's cool. 
by the way
You know, I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K. 
you know
going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family, and having their first Friday night dinners, that Sabbath dinner, and eating together hamin, which is a Jewish food, a stew, just having the connection of realizing, after a while, that a hundred years ago, their families came out of the same place in Northern Africa. 
 just 
I just remember a feeling of surprise; surprise at finding a street with no cars, as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars; surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees. 
 just 
You take your phone out and you know immediately where to go. 
you know
In tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one, and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. 
 just 
Well, if you think that adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly. 
well
Then it was as if I stepped back and thought that I could have very well been one of them. 
well
They also suggested to me that the workshop should be not just for the inmates taking university classes, but for all the inmates. 
 just 
The only thing I want to leave you with is the moment in which those men, some of them just huge when standing next to me, or the young boys - so young, but with an enormous pride, held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated, and read their poems with their voices completely broken. 
 just 
The heart cracks under sad gazes, rides on storms that spread fire, lifts chests lowered by shame, knows that it's not just reading and going on, it also wishes to see the infinite blue. 
 just 
It was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state. 
 just 
I went back to Guatemala, to look for the bodies, to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well. 
well
So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound, for example. 
you see
And what you see there is the state following individuals, people that, like you, wanted to change their country, and they jotted everything down. 
you see
Inside that yellow rectangle, you see a code, it's a secret code: 300. 
you see
And then you see a date. 
you see
That's right, six as well. 
well
Well, we have testimony that said that within this military base, there were bodies, there were graves. 
well
Well, guess what? 
well
Okay? No more missing. 
okay
I'm actually just a survivor, and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous. 
 just 
I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties when I was at university. 
well
Let's just say it's a bit chilly.  And after 70 desperate days, we arrive at the South Pole. 
 just 
Three quarters of that is in the temperate zone, and just one quarter is in the tropics, but this one quarter, one billion hectares, holds most of the biodiversity, and very importantly, 50 percent of the living biomass, the carbon. 
 just 
We have the second largest forest in the world, just after Russia. 
 just 
But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years. 
 just 
Now I will go through all of them one by one -- no, just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years. 
 just 
Maybe this is completely disconnected, as we just learned by having deforestation come down. 
 just 
In fact, if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013, that was over half a million hectares, which means that every minute, an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the Amazon last year, just last year. 
 just 
So to finalize, I think the future is not like a fate that you have to just go as business as usual goes. 
 just 
Today, you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just 35 dollars, and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro-payment of 45 cents using your mobile phone. 
 just 
Do you know that today, there are over 70 million Americans today who are underbanked, because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs. 
you know
that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability, they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well. 
well
Now, when you see this example, you might be thinking, "Well, frugal innovation is low tech." 
well
It allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products: an international bank account number and an international debit card. 
 just 
They charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just 20 Euros. 
 just 
Literally, because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi. 
well
Well, I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that I want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization to do more with less. 
well
So in 1900, as you can see, we were well within the limits of safety. 
well
Well, however complex politically, economically, scientifically the question of the environment is, it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness. 
well
So if you don't care for future generations, just go for it. 
 just 
If you have more consideration for others, you will make sure that you remedy inequality, that you bring some kind of well-being within society, in education, at the workplace. 
well
So the question is, okay, altruism is the answer, it's not just a novel ideal, but can it be a real, pragmatic solution? 
 just 
But are we really all just like rascals? 
 just 
If you see someone deeply wounded, great suffering, you might just help out of empathic distress -- you can't stand it, so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person. 
you see
That is not altruistic. You just feel good." 
 just 
They say, well, but when you interviewed him, he said, "I had no choice. I had to jump, of course." 
well
Well of course, this guy's not going to think for half an hour, "Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?" 
well
Just to give you an idea: this is the meditator at rest on the left, meditator in compassion meditation, you see all the activity, and then the control group at rest, nothing happened, in meditation, nothing happened. 
you see
You would say, "Oh, they're just preschoolers." 
 just 
Some people say, "Well, your stuff works in practice, but does it work in theory?" 
well
Well, first of all, how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale? 
well
Well, first we need to figure out how to make them move when they're so small. 
well
Insects move around amazingly well. 
well
This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab "graduate student with tweezers."  So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps. 
well
So this is Aaron, the graduate student in question, with the tweezers, and what you see is this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high. 
you see
And it survives, bounces on the table, it's incredibly robust, and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny. 
well
Everything is onboard, and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it. 
 just 
Or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood. 
 just 
Or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do, and they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds, effectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites So I think I've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots. 
well
Every time I would think about coming out in the past, I would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana, uniquely Morgana, but not "my lesbian friend Morgana," or "my gay coworker Morgana." 
 just 
And while I was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves, I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions. 
 just 
What I once thought was simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine. 
 just 
On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33 in a balmy winter afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil, a typical South American winter afternoon, this kid, this young man that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal, Juliano Pinto, 29 years old, accomplished a magnificent deed. 
you see
Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the 2014 Brazilian World Soccer Cup here just by thinking. 
 just 
When John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface, meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices, no matter how far they are from their own bodies, just by imagining what they want to do, our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help, of the psychiatry variety. 
 just 
And a brain-machine interface is not rocket science, it's just brain research. 
 just 
So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago, where a monkey, without moving its body, learned to control the movements of an avatar arm, a virtual arm that doesn't exist. 
 just 
And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking, because he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic, quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback. 
 just 
Well, we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed, well, let's have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup be given by a Brazilian paraplegic using a brain-controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball. 
well
They looked at us, thought that we were completely nuts, and said, "Okay, let's try." 
okay
And he just got it right, and now he starts walking. 
 just 
And more than that --  -- more than just walking, he is feeling the ground, and if the speed of the exo goes up, he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos, the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident. 
 just 
So he walks, and at the end of the walk -- I am running out of time already -- he says, "You know, guys, I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married, because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself. 
you know
What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd, and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation. 
 just 
This is the latest: We just published this a year ago, the first brain-to-brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental SMS, a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo, to the second animal, and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message, 
 just 
But what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward. 
you see
Well, we took this to a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net, basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before, and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains, synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move. 
well
We're just scientists. 
 just 
But one thing I know: One day, in a few decades, when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking, or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see, or somebody speaks because of a brain-to-brain bypass, some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick. 
 just 
So if I'm understanding correctly, one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse. 
 just 
And I forgot to mention, because of time, that just three weeks ago, a European group just demonstrated the first man-to-man brain-to-brain connection. 
 just 
And he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending Moderator: Wow. Okay, that's where we are going. 
okay
Human waste, in its rawest form, finds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water, irrigation water, whatever water you see. 
you see
Well in India, we have a theory, which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter, that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions. 
well
But we discovered that if you plant banana trees, papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits, they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas, papayas. 
well
Well, it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband that I have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about. 
well
Well, my answer to this question revolves around two central observations. 
well
Well, the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive. 
well
So what I mean is that Western and African diplomats, United Nations peacekeepers, donors, the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict, they all share a specific way of seeing the world. 
i mean
And I was one of these people, and I shared this culture, so I know all too well how powerful it is. 
well
So to wrap up, the story I just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are, how peace is made, and what interventions should accomplish. 
 just 
It was everywhere in the park -- well, along with a lot of tear gas. 
well
They just took out their phones and looked for actual news. 
 just 
But think of the moments I just mentioned. 
 just 
And this raises a question: As digital technology makes things easier for movements, why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well? 
well
Because, you see, the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting, tedious logistical tasks did not just take care of those tasks, they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together, create consensus and innovate, and maybe even more crucially, keep going together through differences. 
you see
So when you see this March on Washington in 1963, when you look at that picture, where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous "I have a dream" speech, 1963, you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech, you also see the painstaking, long-term work that can put on that march. 
you see
And if you're in power, you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march, not just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously. 
 just 
In contrast, when you look at Occupy's global marches that were organized in two weeks, you see a lot of discontent, but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term. 
you see
Well, he told me. 
well
Well, he said, his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one, and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes, in their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies, and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes. 
well
And like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology. 
 just 
It's also not true, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed, that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties. 
well
No, they come to these protests, just like before, with their friends, existing networks, and sometimes they do make new friends for life. 
 just 
In Turkey, 140Journos are holding hack-a-thons so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism. 
well
These are all great, and we need more, but the answer won't just be better online decision-making, because to update democracy, we are going to need to innovate at every level, from the organizational to the political to the social. 
 just 
The reason that Lofa County is so important is because about five months ago, when the epidemic was just starting to escalate, Lofa County was right at the center, the epicenter of this epidemic. 
 just 
And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you. 
 just 
He heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that Ebola did to people, but what it did to families and what it did to communities. 
 just 
Well, for that, we have to go back 12 months, to the start of this epidemic. 
well
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center, as many of you know, in the area. 
you know
The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is by then, this virus, well known now as Ebola, had spread too far. 
well
Not only did this virus continue in the places where they'd already become infected, but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here, something we'd never seen before on such a scale, an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries but also spreading further and deeper into these countries. 
you see
And they started to ask, how well do we really know this virus? 
well
The reality is we don't know Ebola extremely well. 
well
And then for those who do die, we have to ensure there is a safe, but at the same time dignified, burial process, so that there is no spread at that time as well. 
well
That was the big question that we were facing just two or three months ago. 
 just 
These countries took those strategies I just showed you; the community engagement, the case finding, contact tracing, etc., and they turned them on their head. 
 just 
And we saw the U.N. agencies, the World Food Program, build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about. 
 just 
What we saw was what you see now in this graph, when we took stock on December 1. 
you see
But there are similar stories from the other countries as well. 
well
Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa. 
 just 
How much do you know about what makes you tick, and how good are you at predicting other people's behavior or even your own? 
you know
And how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong? 
you know
And women share the same distribution as well, but actually there's quite a big difference. 
well
Not many people. Okay. 
okay
Okay. What if you think they're fighting? 
okay
Okay, so if you think they're saying hello or high-fiving, then that means you're a friendly person. 
okay
This isn't really a voting one, so on three everyone shout out what you see. 
you see
Well, you should see some kind of two-legged animal here, and then the mirror image of them there. 
well
So if you didn't do that well on this, maybe you are not a very visual type of person. 
well
Okay, so if you said A, then this means that you are a visual learner and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style. 
okay
And if you think about it for just a second, it's just obvious that this has to be true. 
 just 
Could you learn to drive a car, for example, just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience? 
 just 
Well, when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment, what we can do is do a twin study. 
well
So identical twins share 100 percent of their environment and 100 percent of their genes, whereas non-identical twins share 100 percent of their environment, but just like any brother and sister, share only 50 percent of their genes. 
 just 
But again, this is a myth because nearly everything that you do involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together, even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation. 
 just 
That said, it is of course true that most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could. 
well
The myth here is that sportsmen go through hot-hand streaks, Americans call them, or purple patches, we sometimes say in England, where they just can't miss, like this guy here. 
 just 
If you toss a coin, a streak of heads or tails is going to come out somewhere in the randomness, and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none, we look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them and say, "Yeah he's really on form today," whereas actually you would get the same pattern if you were just getting hits and misses at random. 
 just 
The story goes that participants were prepared to give what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant when they got a question wrong, just because someone in a white coat told them to. 
 just 
Okay, so I've been talking for about 12 minutes now, and you've probably been sitting there listening to me, analyzing my speech patterns and body language and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying, whether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying, but if so you've probably completely failed, because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns, 
okay
Speaking of which, it's about time I killed this talk, but before I do, I just want to give you in 30 seconds the overarching myth of psychology. 
 just 
So the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories, all of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer. 
 just 
And it's only by doing so that we can hope to discover which of these theories are well supported, and which, like all the ones I've told you about today, are myths. 
well
And then there are some that are, well, not so good. 
well
Do you see it? What's common about these? 
you see
Well, with cards, most people tend to draw clear, more detailed, and more logical nodes. 
well
Well, here's what happens. 
well
Oh, and by the way, if they do it in complete silence, they do it much better and much more quickly. 
by the way
What's really important to know is that it's the conversations that are the important aspects, not just the models themselves. 
 just 
I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books, but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it, and wonder what was happening, wonder why, and think about the material of the book. 
 just 
I'm just carving around whatever I find interesting. 
 just 
So everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before I began. 
you see
I'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials, weights, in order to hold things in place before I varnish so that I can push the form before I begin, so that something like this can become a piece like this, which is just made from a single dictionary. 
 just 
And with the material itself, I'm using sandpaper and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape, but the material itself suggests a landscape as well. 
well
I think that the book will evolve, and just like people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials, but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job. 
 just 
Now, this is a really important discovery, I think, not just because it tells us something cool about nature, but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs. 
 just 
As the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year 2050, caring for them, as well as the rest of the aging population, will become an overwhelming societal challenge. 
well
I became really concerned about my aunt's well-being as well as my grandfather's safety. 
well
In just two days she was connected to a respirator and on the third day she died. 
 just 
After discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis, I remember my chief resident said to me, "Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face. 
okay
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
The unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical. 
you see
This is not just a theory. 
 just 
Okay, but who's right then? 
okay
Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay, 76.34 percent of you asked the question, 23.41 percent didn't say anything, and the 0.8 percent -- I'm not sure what those guys are doing. 
okay
Well, to my dear 76.31 percent -- it's true that math doesn't need to serve a purpose, it's true that it's a beautiful structure, a logical one, probably one of the greatest collective efforts ever achieved in human history. 
well
 Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems. 
well
In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons, just like bees do. 
 just 
And the world, as you know, split into Pappists and anti-Pappists, until 1700 years later when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right -- the best shape to use was the hexagon. 
you know
The world, as you know, then split into Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists  until a hundred or so years later, someone found a better structure. 
you know
Well, until someone better comes along, right? 
well
Well, nothing. 
well
"Oh, you're feeling depressed? Just shake it off; it's all in your head." 
 just 
Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg." 
 just 
 It was the saddest and longest night of his life as well. 
well
Now I tried to explain what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up the phone and call me?" 
 just 
Loneliness won't just make you miserable, it will kill you. 
 just 
Failure does that as well. 
well
One little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back and looked at the box, with her lower lip trembling. 
 just 
Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time. 
well
You see, that's why so many people function below their actual potential. 
you see
Here's what the friend said: "Well, what do you expect? 
well
It's when your boss yells at you, or your professor makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. 
 just 
You see, my twin brother was diagnosed with stage III non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
you see
A hundred years ago, people began practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. 
 just 
I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing emotional hygiene. 
 just 
I can, because that's the world I want to live in, and that's the world my brother wants to live in as well. 
well
And if you just become informed and change a few simple habits, well, that's the world we can all live in. 
well
 Naughty Umm El-Saad. 
 um
Of course, that's not why Umm El-Saad joined the program. 
 um
Despite her poverty and her community's mindset, which belittles women's education, Umm El-Saad, along with her Egyptian classmates, was eager to learn how to read and write. 
 um
And it's really helpful, and it works really well, so that's really the important part of what we're doing. 
well
We just work together, and even, for example, when architects visit what we're doing, sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan. 
 just 
This was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland, which was using caravans as modules to build a starship. 
 just 
Now, when we're thinking about starships, we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge. 
 just 
I was just coming down to make my selection." 
 just 
She said, "You know what? I'm really sorry, but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them." 
you know
But you know the problem: We can't make people rent to folks that they don't want to rent to. 
you know
And then I asked him, "Can I just leave the trailer here, and that would take care of all my problems, I wouldn't have to find another trailer park?" 
 just 
And that was strange to me because there were several other slots that were open, but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else. 
 just 
He said, "I just can't rent to you." 
 just 
I mean, a really small trailer park. 
i mean
That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand-new automobile. 
 just 
When I walked inside, the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks, some other people were coming in behind me. 
 just 
She said, "You know, I'm really sorry, I just rented the last one. 
you know
So I just got the hint and I left, and went outside to the parking lot. 
 just 
And we did drive down the road, but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot, guess what happened? 
 just 
So we're just trying to get him to stay in school. 
 just 
Because you never know, just because you're funny at home, does not make you a comedian, right? 
 just 
For some reason, at that moment it just all hit me. 
 just 
He said, "I'm just so confused. 
 just 
We do everything we do, but it seems that driving while black, walking while black, talking while black, it's just dangerous. 
 just 
But instead, to elevate your level of societal knowledge, your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together, all of us come together, to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity, any kind of insanity that makes it okay to kill unarmed people, regardless of their ethnicity, regardless of their race, regardless of their diversity makeup. 
okay
We need to have black and white and Asian and Hispanic just to step forward and say, "We are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore." 
 just 
So you go and look at data like this, and instead of just counting the number of cabs, we can start to ask different questions. 
 just 
And I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers, these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take. 
 just 
 So I said to myself, I guess there's no rush hour in New York City. 
i guess
There's just a rush day. 
 just 
This data wasn't just available, it turns out. 
 just 
But there's a story behind this data as well. 
well
This data didn't just appear. 
 just 
So what happened is, the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. 
 just 
And the fact that the data's here, the fact that we have access to it -- Every accident, by the way, is a row in this table. 
by the way
And not just our crime data, our own city budget. 
 just 
And it's not just us that can't analyze it -- our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in PDF. 
 just 
And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well. 
well
Well, it's kind of a little weird, but I looked at the level of fecal coliform, which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways. 
well
What you see is inland waterways. 
you see
If you were to go to the open data portal, you'd see just a snippet of it, a year or a few months. 
 just 
This is where 1,100 data sets that don't suffer from the things I just told you live, and that number is growing, and that's great. 
 just 
This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City, but not just any fire hydrants. 
 just 
Number one, just don't park on the Upper East Side. 
 just 
And it wasn't just me who found a parking ticket. 
 just 
Let's just start normalizing our addresses. 
 just 
And by the way, who are we empowering with this? 
by the way
Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong. 
 just 
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week released something called citygram.nyc that allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints around your own home, or around your office. 
 just 
And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. 
 just 
You know the story, right? 
you know
You know, the story may seem real, but I bet it's incomplete. 
you know
But whenever you go inside, there are other ways you have to pick as well. 
well
Even if I did little, sales would be okay. 
okay
But okay is never okay. 
okay
"Oh, I created this great product, but the market is so bad, the sales didn't go well." 
well
And one last tip, and this one is really important as well: Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. 
well
Two seconds later, one looks at the other and says, "Okay, let's go down." 
okay
Although they very carefully preserved the stomach, the lungs, the liver, and so forth, they just mushed up the brain, drained it out through the nose, and threw it away, which makes sense, really, because what does a brain do for us anyway? 
 just 
And imagine if, through new scientific advances, we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves. 
 just 
Well, it turns out that we do have something just like that: our gut, or rather, its microbes. 
well
But it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important. 
 just 
We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out.  So microbes are performing a huge range of functions. 
 just 
Well, it wouldn't look exactly like this, but it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity. 
well
Different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another With microbiology, it's kind of the same, although I've got to be honest with you: All the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope. 
to be honest
And we've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another. 
 just 
So if I look at just one person's microbes in the mouth and in the gut, it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous. 
 just 
Well, in part it's because although there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut, they really outnumber us. 
well
Well, it depends on what you think of as our bodies. 
well
Well, each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells, but we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells. 
well
Now, you might think, well, we're human because of our DNA, but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes, depending on what you count exactly, but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes. 
well
Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids, you probably have some dark suspicions about that, all of which are true, by the way. 
well
So just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share, we can also match you up to your dog. 
 just 
With a sample size of just one child, no matter how much we love her, you don't really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average, but at two years old, she hasn't had an ear infection yet, so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one. 
 just 
So I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens. 
 just 
What you can see, and remember each step in this is just one week, what you can see is that week to week, the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child, the differences week to week are much greater than the differences between individual healthy adults in the Human Microbiome Project cohort, which are those brown dots down at the bottom. 
 just 
I'll just rewind that for you. 
 just 
And what we can see is that just over these few weeks, we have a much more radical change, a setback of many months of normal development, followed by a relatively rapid recovery, and by the time he reaches day 838, which is the end of this video, you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community, despite that antibiotic intervention. 
 just 
So does what we do early on, where the microbiome is changing so rapidly, actually matter, or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea, where the ripples will just be lost? 
 just 
Well, fascinatingly, it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life, they're more likely to become obese later on than if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later, and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we're only beginning to understand. 
well
So I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions, and they've also now, just over the past few years, been connected to a whole range of different diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, colon cancer, and even obesity. 
 just 
Well, one thing we can do is we can raise some mice without any microbes of their own in a germ-free bubble. 
well
So in a project funded by the Gates Foundation, what we're looking at is children in Malawi who have kwashiorkor, a profound form of malnutrition, and mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them lose 30 percent of their body mass in just three weeks, but we can restore their health by using the same peanut butter-based supplement that is used for the children in the clinic, and the mice that receive the community 
 just 
Well, it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health, but they can actually cure disease. 
well
 So we're just at the beginning of this discovery. 
 just 
We're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity, and perhaps even autism and depression. 
 just 
What we need to do, though, is we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS, where we don't just know where we are currently but also where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there, and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it.  Thank you. 
 just 
So, I just encourage you, as you are all thinking about the next big thing, as entrepreneurs, as CEOs, as engineers, as makers, that you think about the unintended consequences because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone. 
 just 
They had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging, and one day, we went walking, again as tourists, out into the forest, and within five minutes' walk, we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down, five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters from the ranger station. 
 just 
It struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time, just a few hundred meters away from a ranger station in a sanctuary, that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up. 
 just 
Well, we had people. 
well
We had this group there that was dedicated, three full-time guards, that was dedicated to go and stop it, but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest. 
 just 
It might just be the cheapest, fastest way to fight climate change. 
 just 
We have to put them in this box that you see here, and we do have to power them. 
you see
Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with, because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy, any sort of solar power under a tree canopy, was an as-yet-unsolved problem, and that's this unique solar panel design that you see here, which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process. 
you see
Well, to test it, we took it back to Indonesia, not the same place, but another place, to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging. 
well
Actually, we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down. 
 just 
It just came from using what's already there, and I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones, that there's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts. 
 just 
Now, many of us probably think, well, one email, there's nothing in there, right? 
well
Well, if we really think about it, we see that the business model of the Internet today really isn't compatible with privacy. 
well
Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web, and you see that advertising plays a huge role. 
you see
At that time, we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research at the world's largest particle collider, which collides protons, by the way. 
by the way
Well, it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server. 
well
Once his account is created, he just clicks "compose," and now he can write his email like he does today. 
 just 
So he fills in his information, and then after that, all he has to do is click "send," and just like that, without understanding cryptography, and without doing anything different from how he writes email today, Bob has just sent an encrypted message. 
 just 
What we have here is really just the first step, but it shows that with improving technology, privacy doesn't have to be difficult, it doesn't have to be disruptive. 
 just 
Now, I know a question on everybody's minds is, okay, protecting privacy, this is a great goal, without the tons of money that advertisements give you? 
okay
So this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal. 
 just 
Right now, we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail, and these people come from everywhere, and this really shows that privacy is not just an American or a European issue, it's a global issue that impacts all of us. 
 just 
Well, first of all, we need to support a different business model for the Internet, one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth. 
well
But even more importantly, we have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default. 
 just 
We have done the first step with ProtonMail, but this is really just the first step in a very, very long journey. 
 just 
This really matters, because ultimately, privacy depends on each and every one of us, and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros. 
 just 
Well, the truth is, why is the majority of everything bad? 
well
By the way you reacted, I can see your lack of interest. 
by the way
 But that's okay, I understand why. 
okay
Audience member 2: No, I just felt your energy. 
 just 
HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence! 
you see
And just like that, very clearly, I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it, we're going to actually have a camera man onstage. 
 just 
And just like that. 
 just 
All the cards in order, just for you. 
 just 
They're just normal people. 
 just 
So I just gave him a look in his eyes and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning, and he said to me, "Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble, because you're looking like you want to fight." 
 just 
I just punched him right in his face, and we began fighting right then and there. 
 just 
However, institutions need to give these correctional officers proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population, and they also need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with the mental health population as well. 
well
I just came out of the weight shack from working out, and I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky. 
 just 
He said, "You look up and you tell me what you see." 
you see
"Clouds."  He said, "All right. What else do you see?" 
you see
"I don't know. You know? 
you know
 Ridiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing. 
okay
Even if you know what your aim is, think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed. 
you know
You just have to choose words at random. 
 just 
This method is, of course, not just for toys. 
 just 
Takes just under a minute to work out that it’s because of the way that he slept. 
 just 
He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her, And it was different this time. I mean, this girl was wicked, So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits. 
i mean
She loved talking to someone just as quirky, She agreed to this unofficial first date. 
 just 
Because that wasn't real love, that love was just a sample, When it came to real love, they were a prime example. 
 just 
I hear you cry. Well I ... 
well
I’d probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people with a proper pop-up purple people paperclip, but I’d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives, a cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped. 
 just 
That’s 7892 days straight of someone checking I’m okay, and that’s amazing. 
okay
You see, people have potential to be powerful. 
you see
 Thank you very much. I've just got time for one more. 
 just 
There’d been times when he’d tried to hide his brightness, You see, every star hits periods of hardship, It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness. 
you see
But that’s when Little Miss Sunshine came along Singing her favorite song about how we’re made to be strong, And you don’t have to be wrong to belong, Just be true to who you are, because we are all stars at heart. 
 just 
Keep your hands up, if you know who this is. 
you know
Even with all those arrows, he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative, interrelated and, frankly, messy their process was. 
 just 
As many of you know, they're the result, usually, of trial and error. 
you know
When you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria -- aid worker abducted, hostage executed -- but who were they? 
you see
My brain went on automatic, rewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind. 
 just 
I was no more than just a commodity. 
 just 
I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper, just two metal buckets open, one for water, for one waste. 
 just 
Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk? 
 just 
One part of your brain wants you to resist, to shout, to cry, and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up and just go through it. 
 just 
I was no longer just a commodity. 
 just 
He probably meant well. 
well
Well, explaining why we do this is not that easy, even to our closest relatives. 
well
When you have a tsunami, an earthquake or a typhoon, you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world, searching for survivors for weeks. 
you see
In that war, that nobody seriously wanted to stop, and we have many of these today, bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity, it was making a real difference for the people. 
 just 
Well, if you are met this way, if you sign up for this sort of job, your life is going to be full of joy and sadness, because there are a lot of people we cannot help, a lot of people we cannot protect, a lot of people we did not save. 
well
Do you know that since the millennium, the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled? 
you know
You know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs. 
you know
It's just a really great building. 
 just 
It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air, and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings, so they just feel more comfortable to be in. 
 just 
This is one of our exhibits, which is an interactive map of London that shows just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death and dying, and as you wave your hand across the map, the name of that piece of real estate, the building or cemetery, is revealed. 
 just 
Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well. 
well
The pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges, and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food. 
 just 
We need more than just microcredit. 
 just 
We need more than just give 200 dollars. 
 just 
Well, I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true. 
well
Over 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS, and here are just a few of those. 
 just 
Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you, but others said minor symptoms were just as important. 
 just 
Well, using this criteria and looking at most recent studies, we see that on average, three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD. 
well
Well, certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive from books, TV, movies, the Internet, that everyone gets PMS go a long way in convincing them it must be true. 
well
Let me tell you what I mean by "erroneously." 
i mean
Well, PMS has become a permission slip to be angry, complain, be irritated, without losing the title of good woman. 
well
When people respond to a woman's anger with the thought, "Oh, it's just that time of the month," her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited. 
 just 
Well, I can tell you that treating PMS has become a profitable, thriving industry. 
well
Well, that doesn't make sense. 
well
Now, what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology, that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that's out there. 
 just 
Instead, our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world. 
 just 
It's called the umwelt, which is the German word for the surrounding world. 
 um
Now, presumably, every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there, because why would you ever stop to imagine that there's something beyond what we can sense. 
 um
 So because we're humans, we've never experienced that world of smell, so we don't miss it, because we are firmly settled into our umwelt. 
 um
So as a neuroscientist, I'm interested in the way that technology might expand our umwelt, and how that's going to change the experience of being human. 
 um
But the fact is that it works; the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine. 
 just 
Well, here's the big secret: Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this. 
well
Whatever information comes in, it just figures out what to do with it. 
 just 
It's essentially a general purpose computing device, and it just takes in everything and figures out what it's going to do with it, and that, I think, frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels. 
 just 
Okay. So what this means is this: The lesson that surfaces is that there's nothing really special or fundamental about the biology that we come to the table with. 
okay
It's just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution. 
 just 
And that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels, and the brain just figures out what to do with it. 
 just 
So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera, you're feeling that in your back, and amazingly, blind people got pretty good just by feeling it in the small of their back. 
 just 
It sounds like a cacophony, but after several weeks, blind people start getting pretty good at understanding what's in front of them just based on what they're hearing. 
 just 
It just figures out what to do with them. 
 just 
So as I'm speaking, my sound is getting captured by the tablet, and then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors, just like the motors in your cell phone. 
 just 
Now, this is not just conceptual: this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth, and I'm wearing the vest right now. 
 just 
So, we've been testing this with deaf people now, and it turns out that after just a little bit of time, people can start feeling, they can start understanding the language of the vest. 
 just 
He was born profoundly deaf, which means that there's a part of his umwelt that's unavailable to him. 
 um
How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense, to expand the human umvelt? 
 um
And what we're seeing is, can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have, after several weeks, a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet. 
 um
So we'll report on that later to see how well this goes. 
well
We're also expanding the umvelt of pilots. 
 um
And that's just the beginning. 
 just 
DE: Well, that's right, I wouldn't have to write to NIH anymore. 
well
CA: Well look, just to be skeptical for a minute, I mean, this is amazing, but isn't most of the evidence so far that sensory substitution works, not necessarily that sensory addition works? 
well
I mean, isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue because the visual cortex is still there, ready to process, and that that is needed as part of it? 
i mean
It just runs certain kinds of computations on things. 
 just 
DE: I mean, I think there's a lot of applications here. 
i mean
So this is a way of just feeling the state of something, just like the way you know the state of your body as you're standing around. 
you know
You see this object here. 
you see
And very often, as you know, new ideas are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities, and that's our story. 
you know
Okay, just like the movies. 
 just 
One, it has a reservoir that holds the puddle, just like the T-1000. 
 just 
Think about if you need a stent in an emergency situation, instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes, having a stent that's designed for you, for your own anatomy with your own tributaries, printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after 18 months: really-game changing. 
 just 
You know, the world is really good at nano-fabrication. 
you know
And subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can't do that very well. 
well
They can't etch wafers that well. 
well
That meant that in 1998, the oldest among the group were only 14, and the youngest, just four. 
 just 
You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was? 
you know
Remember, just a few years earlier, news was consumed from just three places: reading a newspaper or magazine, listening to the radio, or watching television. 
 just 
I mean, who can remember what they said a year ago? 
i mean
This was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998, and by this, I mean the stealing of people's private words, actions, conversations or photos, and then making them public -- public without consent, public without context, and public without compassion. 
i mean
My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family, and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand, and then eventually I realized she was reliving 1998, reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night, reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open, and reliving a time when both of my parents feared 
 just 
And you know what shocked me, although it shouldn't have, was other research last year that determined humiliation than either happiness or even anger. 
you know
Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone. 
 just 
It's also not just about saving myself. 
 just 
 Girl: Okay, that's a cat sitting in a bed. 
okay
Cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two-dimensional array of numbers known as pixels, but these are just lifeless numbers. 
 just 
So ultimately, we want to teach the machines to see just like we do: naming objects, identifying people, inferring 3D geometry of things, understanding relations, emotions, actions and intentions. 
 just 
Once, I even joked to my graduate students that I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet. 
 just 
We applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images across hundreds of American cities, and we have learned something really interesting: first, it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes. 
well
But surprisingly, car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities, or voting patterns by zip codes. 
well
So far, we have just taught the computer to see objects. 
 just 
Now, the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans. 
well
FFL: But there's so much more to this picture than just a person and a cake. 
 just 
Robots, not just humans, will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded. 
 just 
So he reasoned, like a budding American pragmatist, "Well, God wouldn't want me to starve, would he?" 
well
His mother told him, regretfully, as a boy that she'd been just 50 dollars short of aborting him. 
 just 
You see, late in 2009, eight years after that shooting, Raisuddin had gone on his own journey, a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
you see
A newly minted American citizen, he had come to believe that Stroman was the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away. 
 just 
This immigrant begging America to be as merciful to a native son In the mini-mart, all those years earlier, not just two men, but two Americas collided. 
 just 
If you live near a Whole Foods, if no one in your family serves in the military, if you're paid by the year, not the hour, if most people you know finished college, if no one you know uses meth, if you married once and remain married, if you're not one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record -- if any or all of these things describe you, then accept the possibility that actually, 
you know
And by elevating the material and my dad's skill, could we start to think about tar just like clay, in a new way, shaping it differently, helping us to imagine what was possible? 
 just 
After clay, I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials, and my studio grew a lot because I thought, well, it's not really about the material, it's about our capacity to shape things. 
well
I became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that were happening just outside my studio. 
 just 
There is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood, and while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career, there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio. 
 just 
We made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening on my block. 
 just 
I was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could with whatever and whoever would join me. 
 just 
Black Cinema House, which was made from just a small piece of clay, had to grow into a much larger piece of clay, which is now my studio. 
 just 
And so we just started imagining, what else could happen in this building? 
 just 
But as a result of that, I'm finding that there's not just room for my own artistic practice, there's room for a lot of other artistic practices. 
 just 
So people started asking us, "Well, Theaster, how are you going to go to scale?" 
well
 June Cohen: Thank you. So I think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end: How can they do this in their own city? 
 just 
Theaster Gates: One of the things I've found that's really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project, like an old house, but what's the relationship between an old house, a local school, a small bodega, and is there some kind of synergy between those things? 
 just 
Because I think it's not just a cultural space or housing; there has to be the recreation of an economic core. 
 just 
And how can you make sure that the projects you're creating are actually for the disadvantaged and not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd that might move in to take advantage of them. 
 just 
But are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or a mission-based development that starts to protect some of the space that happens, because when you have 7,500 empty lots in a city, you want something to happen there, but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece, but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece, and I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated, 
 just 
I was scared, but I knew very well that that particular day, I had to make a decision. 
well
The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans. 
 just 
Do you know why you were born? 
you know
I just want to ask you a couple quick questions. 
 just 
Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person's life, and in yours. 
 just 
I want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth. 
 just 
JL: Well, I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous or constrict you or anything. 
well
SL: I remember when you were a baby, you had really bad colic, so you would just cry and cry. 
 just 
SL: Well, I can understand why you think that people like Amy more, and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome, but being friendly comes easily to Amy, whereas I think for you it's more difficult, but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much. 
well
JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos? SL: Yeah -- JL: Like I have better quality friends but less quantity?  SL: I wouldn't judge the quality, but I think -- JL: I mean, first it was like, Amy loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia, she loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia. 
i mean
I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight. 
 just 
 You know, a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories, and it's not because they're sad. 
you know
So many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness, courage, decency and dignity, and when you hear that kind of story, it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground. 
 just 
 Danny Perasa: You see, the thing of it is, I always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you. 
you see
DP: Well, the only thing that could possibly be wrong is I couldn't find a silly pen. 
well
This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after Oshea was freed. 
 just 
Oshea Israel: Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation. 
 just 
We're not going to cut you off, and that's something I've always wanted you to just know, that you're loved. 
 just 
AM: You know, I live this every day now. 
you know
I mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe, but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day. 
i mean
They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another, and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth. 
 just 
 Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist, and became a well-known gay activist. 
well
And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infinitely. 
 just 
Well, it turns out, I'm all of these. 
well
And then, I just got on with it. 
 just 
And I've just started a three-year think tank for autism. 
 just 
So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. 
well
Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. 
 just 
Those are flashes of sound that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me, just like a bat's sonar, and return to me with patterns, with pieces of information, much as light does for you. 
 just 
Whoosh. Okay. 
okay
 This will take a while.   Okay, lots of hands in the air. 
okay
Okay, anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own.  So we all face challenges, and we all face the dark unknown, which is endemic to most challenges, which is what most of us fear, okay? 
okay
So if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment, okay? 
 just 
Okay, nothing very interesting. 
okay
Okay, now keep your eyes closed because, did you hear the difference? 
okay
Okay. Now, let's be sure. 
okay
For your challenge, you tell me, just say "now" when you hear the panel start to move. 
 just 
Okay? We'll relax into this. 
okay
All right. So just a few centimeters, you would notice the difference. 
 just 
DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view, so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me. 
well
CA: Well, Daniel, you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way. 
well
And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all. 
well
There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood. 
 just 
And that was just luck. 
 just 
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. 
well
NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained? 
well
The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well. 
well
These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. 
 just 
The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe. 
well
Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries, it affects all of us in ways, perhaps, we've never thought of: the air we breathe, the water we drink, the fish we eat, the quality of our oceans, the languages we speak in the future, the jobs we have, the political systems we choose, 
 just 
You see that bloke? He's French. 
you see
Because China is today not just woken up, China has stood up and China is on the march, and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the 21st century? 
 just 
And with a mega-change comes also a mega-challenge, and the mega-challenge is this: Can these two great countries, China and the United States -- China, the Middle Kingdom, and the United States, Měiguó -- which in Chinese, by the way, means "the beautiful country." 
by the way
Well, there are two reasons for that. 
well
1971, I had just turned 14 years of age, and she handed me this headline. 
 just 
But in that little story, there's a wisdom, which is, as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of 5,000 years of continuing history, there's always something new to learn. 
you know
His name is Sun Tzu. He wrote "The Art of War," and if you see his statement underneath, it's along these lines: "Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected." 
you see
The economic historians tell us that in fact, the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in 1914, just before that happened, World War I, a sobering reflection from history. 
 just 
And beyond all that, the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant. 
 just 
So apart from all of that, it's just fine and dandy, the U.S.-China relationship. 
 just 
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
And then I remember this family saying to me, "You know, we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing, drove our way through redneck country. 
you know
I think you know what I'm talking about. 
you know
The white folks, our Aboriginal brothers and sisters, and we haven't solved all these problems together, but let me tell you, there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head, we'd gone also to the heart. 
 just 
Sometimes, folks, we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land. 
 just 
Because if we do that, we might just change the way that we think about each other. 
 just 
Kevin Rudd: Well, what we Australians do best is organize the drinks, so you get them together in one room, and we suggest this and suggest that, then we go and get the drinks. 
well
And you see this teenager running down a street, and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours. 
you see
But then I started thinking, okay, well that's a part of you, but how do I put all of you inside of the frame? 
well
And a frame is just a window. 
 just 
I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema -- they're these windows into these other worlds. 
i mean
And I thought, well, great. I got you in a frame. 
well
You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions. 
you see
We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. 
 just 
Well, if we did the same thing, you tasted the same beer, now in the blind taste, things would look slightly different. 
well
Okay, here's what lots of Americans tell us. 
okay
If you remember John Rawls, he had this notion of what's a just society. 
 just 
He said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it, you would be willing to enter it in a random place. 
 just 
Now, we can ask these questions, by the way, not just about wealth. 
 just 
We can ask it about other things as well. 
well
What is reality? And you could say, well, it's not that bad, right? 
well
Wealth is not just about wealth. 
 just 
You see, the Rawls definition, the Rawls way of looking at the world, the blind tasting approach, takes our selfish motivation out of the picture. 
you see
In parallel, a small mission to a comet, what you see here, Giotto, was launched, and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft. 
you see
Normally, you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are. 
you know
They're just like you and me. 
 just 
Here you see in white the trajectory, and the way this works. 
you see
You see that from the circle where we started, the white line, actually you get more and more and more elliptical, and then finally we approached the comet in May 2014, and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers. 
you see
This is the moon rising over Earth, and this is what we now call a selfie, which at that time, by the way, that word didn't exist.  It's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera. 
by the way
That's one of the cameras on the lander, and it just looks under the solar arrays, and you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance. 
you see
We had to do eight maneuvers, and you see here, some of them were really big. 
you see
What you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet, and the sun shines from above. 
you see
There is a long-term variation, which in itself is not surprising, but you see the sharp peaks. 
you see
Here, you see the same image twice. 
you see
On the left-hand side, you see in the middle a pit. 
you see
You see it on the right-hand side. 
you see
You see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta. 
you see
On the top right, you see an image taken at 60 meters by the lander, 60 meters above the surface of the comet. 
you see
Here, you see the whole sequence again, but from a different perspective, and you see three blown-ups from the bottom-left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet. 
you see
 During the first bounce, in the magnetometers, you see here the data from them, from the three axes, x, y and z. 
you see
Halfway through, you see a red line. 
you see
It was like a scene from doomsday, or maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies that shows that everything is breaking apart and the world is just ending. 
 just 
If you are a parent, you know that kids love to keep making circles. 
you know
And if the roof is too high, you see only the ceiling. 
you see
You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water to your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. 
you see
But here, just they leave and come back. 
 just 
You know that children sleep better in noise. 
you know
And you know, our kind grew up in the jungle with noise. 
you know
And you know, you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar. 
you know
And you know, these days we are trying to make everything under control. 
you know
You know, it's completely open. 
you know
They talk to each other around the well. 
well
He's okay. His skull is quite strong. 
okay
The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know. 
you know
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes, just to remind them. 
 just 
I went to another leader and his wife told me, "Okay, you go, he will definitely join." 
okay
And you know, outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of. 
you know
So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world, a more just and equitable world? 
 just 
And unfortunately, I'm sad to report that right now we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous, certainly of my career, and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well. 
well
We don't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income or their credit score, but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses, and you know what? 
you know
The more you go up that, the worse the problems are, and those metrics include life expectancy, teenage pregnancy, literacy, social mobility, just to name a few. 
 just 
Now, those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder, well, where does the United States rank? 
well
And let me just say, this profits mania that we're on is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. 
 just 
But the point is, this mania is so deeply entrenched that well-intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it. 
well
And oh, by the way, we've since quadrupled that, but --  -- Please. 
by the way
But we can do it by driving more just behavior. 
 just 
About a year ago, some friends of mine and I started a not-for-profit called Just Capital. 
 just 
Its mission is very simple: to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior. 
 just 
Now, right now, there's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow, and that's where Just Capital comes in, because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of 20,000 Americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior. 
 just 
At Just Capital, we don't know, and it's not for us to decide. 
 just 
We're calling it the Just Index, and remember, we're an independent not-for-profit with no bias, and we will be giving the American public a voice. 
 just 
I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else. 
 just 
Well, you know, sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages. 
well
In fact, the planets and moons you see here could host life -- all of them -- and we know that, and it's a strong possibility. 
you see
And you know, it's getting worse, because we won't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet, and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone. 
you know
So is everything lost? Well, maybe not. 
well
Well clearly at the beginning of the solar system, Mars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets, and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place. 
well
At the time when life appeared on the Earth, Mars did have an ocean, it had volcanoes, it had lakes, and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here. 
you see
We just need a time machine. 
 just 
Well, actually, it is. 
well
And now, what you see here, we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes, but in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed. 
you see
The Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that -- volcanoes everywhere, evaporating lakes everywhere, minerals, hot springs, and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes? 
you see
Everything you see in this picture is a living organism. 
you see
The red color you see here is not due to minerals. 
you see
SPF 30 is not going to do anything to you over there, and the water is so transparent in those lakes that the algae has nowhere to hide, really, and so they are developing their own sunscreen, and this is the red color you see. 
you see
And those microbes, the rocks you see in that slide here, well, they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the U.V. 
well
But in the end, it might be just us, it might be us and Mars, or it can be many trees of life in the solar system. 
 just 
Well, organic material is going to tell you about environment, about complexity and about diversity. 
well
Hi. I'm going to talk to you today about laughter, and I just want to start by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter. 
 just 
I just cared about the laughter, and actually, as a neuroscientist, I've come to care about it again. 
 just 
What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing, and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be, and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound. 
 just 
There's a point in there where I'm just, like, you've got to get some air in there, mate, because he just sounds like he's breathing out. 
 just 
So you use the intercostal muscles, the muscles between your ribs, to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage, and if I was to put a strap around the outside of your chest called a breath belt, and just look at that movement, you see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement, so that's breathing. 
you see
So what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this. 
you see
Now, both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy, and that enemy is laughter, because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly, and you get this very marked sort of zig-zagging, and that's just squeezing the air out of you. 
 just 
You're just squeezing air out, and each of those contractions -- Ha! -- gives you a sound. 
 just 
It's been well-described and well-observed in primates, but you also see it in rats, and wherever you find it -- humans, primates, rats -- you find it associated with things like tickling. 
well
You can catch laughter from somebody else, and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them. 
you know
Interestingly, you see something quite similar with chimpanzees. 
you see
We just played people real and posed laughs. 
 just 
What you see in the regions in blue, which lies in auditory cortex, are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs, and what seems to be the case, when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily, you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context. 
you see
In contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way, what you see are these regions in pink, which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing, thinking about what somebody else is thinking. 
you see
So this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society, and here we just asked people two questions. 
 just 
What you see is there is a rapid onset. 
you see
Now, either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older, or it may mean that as you understand laughter better, and you are getting better at doing that, you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh. 
 just 
And what you see is immediately -- just run that one through your head briefly, you and your partner -- you can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts. 
you see
We're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other, we're making ourselves feel better together. 
 just 
  These events are always difficult, I had a relative who was being a bit difficult, my mum was not in a good place, and I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started telling this story about something that happened in a 1970s sitcom, and I just thought at the time, I don't know why I'm doing this, and what I realized I was doing was I was coming up with something from somewhere 
 just 
We're going to be okay. 
okay
Everything you see here is a galaxy, comprised of billions of stars each. 
you see
So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes. 
 just 
We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. 
 just 
Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth. 
well
I think the Sahara's still full of treasures, and when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews, and he said, "Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner -- and the world is still full of corners." 
 just 
To be honest, by personality, I'm just not much of a crier. 
 just 
It turns out that tears just aren't much help when you're trying to investigate a genocide. 
 just 
But I just wish that I, and the rest of the world, had been moved earlier. 
 just 
And not just to tears, but to actually stop the genocide. 
 just 
She sat down with me for hours, just ushered me in to the world of poverty. 
 just 
She described what it was like when the coals on the cooking fire finally just went completely cold. 
 just 
She had to watch her youngest son, Peter, suffer from malnutrition, as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness. 
 just 
If you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day, it turns out that virtually the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school, are still stuck there, 35 years later. 
 just 
Well, let's think about Venus for a moment. 
well
Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor and "cause trouble" is what happened the day after Venus' husband died, when Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house, stole all their land, and robbed their market stall. 
 just 
You see, Venus was thrown into destitution by violence. 
you see
Days before we met her, while she was walking home from church with her family, in broad daylight, men from her community just snatched her off the street, and violently raped her. 
 just 
See, Griselda had every opportunity to go to school, it just wasn't safe for her to get there. 
 just 
Because in the lives of the poor, it just descends like a plague and it destroys everything. 
 just 
So for me, as a lawyer, of course, my first reaction was to think, well, of course we've got to change all the laws. 
well
Functioning law enforcement for us is just a total assumption. 
 just 
So we take this just completely for granted. 
 just 
This was her worst nightmare, because this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault just two weeks before. 
 just 
Or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything? 
you know
Woman: Um, yeah, so ... 
 um
Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do is give you some advice, and call the sheriff's office tomorrow. 
well
You know, the sheriff's office doesn't work up there. 
you know
And so the epidemic of everyday violence, it just rages on. 
 just 
Because the data just doesn't lie. 
 just 
A fresh water organization tells a heart-wrenching story of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water, and then celebrates the solution of a new well that drastically shortens their walk. 
well
And yet, for some reason, this is okay for poor people. 
okay
I was at the World Economic Forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world and I was just asking them, "How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence?" 
 just 
Recently, the Gates Foundation funded a project in the second largest city of the Philippines, where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically, that in just four short years, they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence against poor kids by 79 percent. 
 just 
You know, from the hindsight of history, what's always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion. 
you know
Because I think history convenes a tribunal of our grandchildren and they just ask us, "Grandma, Grandpa, where were you? 
 just 
And Grandpa, where were you when they were beating our African-American neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote?" 
 just 
GH: Well, one of the glorious things that's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious. 
well
But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise. 
 just 
There's a political will struggle that's going to take place as well, but those are winnable fights, because we've done some examples around the world at International Justice Mission that are very encouraging. 
well
CA: So just tell us in one country, how much it costs to make a material difference to police, for example -- I know that's only one piece of it. 
 just 
I think of how hard it must have been, how profoundly unfair it must have felt for them to feel like they had to strip away parts of my childhood just so that I could come home at night. 
 just 
We had teachers who taught us how to raise our hands in class, and not just to signal surrender, and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we aren't worthy of this world. 
 just 
But I like to say, okay, let's look at the modern human condition. 
okay
We defined human-level here as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well as an adult human, so real human-level, not just within some limited domain. 
well
But I think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence, the true picture is actually probably more like this: AI starts out at this point here, at zero intelligence, and then, after many, many years of really hard work, maybe eventually we get to mouse-level artificial intelligence, something that can navigate cluttered environments as well as a mouse can. 
well
This could become practically relevant, not just as a metaphor for greed, but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it misconceived or poorly specified goals. 
 just 
Now you might say, if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people's faces, we'd just shut it off. 
 just 
The initial conditions for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation. 
 just 
The values that the A.I. has need to match ours, not just in the familiar context, like where we can easily check how the A.I. behaves, but also in all novel contexts that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future. 
 just 
Now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the architecture where it will be implemented. 
you know
But the more of the control problem that we solve in advance, the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well. 
well
This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if things turn out okay, that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right. 
well
And so in order to be able to access the brain, you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools. 
 just 
When I was a graduate student, my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself, decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone that you know, an amateur or a high school student, could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience. 
you know
And so we did just that. 
 just 
GG: I need you to stick out your arm for science, roll up your sleeve a bit, So what I'm going to do, I'm putting electrodes on your arm, and you're probably wondering, I just said I'm going to record from your brain, what am I doing with your arm? 
 just 
Let's take a look at it as well. 
well
I want you to move your arm as well. 
well
So I just need to hook you up. 
 just 
Okay, so Sam, I want you to squeeze your hand again. 
okay
So now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the -- It's going to feel a little bit weird at first, this is going to feel like a --  You know, when you lose your free will, and someone else becomes your agent, it does feel a bit strange. 
you know
GG: Okay, do it again? MG: A little bit. 
okay
All right, so right now, your brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm, so go ahead and just do it one more time. 
 just 
And so, just relax your hand. 
 just 
Now, the diagram that you see here, I know it looks like some kind of sports play, but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. 
you see
The growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. 
you see
And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale, but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast, in larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other, and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. 
well
The problem's actually a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending poor kids to prison, we're saddling poor kids with court fees, with probation and parole restrictions, with low-level warrants, we're asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest, and we're asking them to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color, not for the purposes of promoting public safety, but to make arrest counts, to line city coffers. 
 just 
Not just in the streets, but in their homes, at school and at work. 
 just 
He had just turned 18. 
 just 
Okay, you might say. 
okay
Okay, you might say. 
okay
is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on. 
 just 
It's 23 feet long and just six feet across at its widest point. 
 just 
 TMM: Just sprained my ankle. 
 just 
Ooh ooh ooh, ah ah ah ah ah. 
 ah 
Ah ah, ah ah ah. 
 ah 
 Dannielle Hadley: Life in Pennsylvania means just that: life without the possibility of parole. 
 just 
Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right, so instead, we made this giant woven pod. 
 just 
 So there are lots of things that we're still working on, but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right. 
well
It lives off of rainwater, spring water, sunlight, and of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world, we use just seven of them. 
 just 
He's the one who got me building with bamboo, and he is standing in a clump of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago. 
 just 
That shoot, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week, so we're talking about sustainable timber in three years. 
 just 
Because it's hollow, it's lightweight, light enough to be lifted by just a few men, or, apparently, one woman. 
 just 
And when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago, I just thought, this makes perfect sense. 
 just 
Nine of them are at Green Village -- you've just seen inside some of these homes -- and we fill them with bespoke furniture, we surround them with veggie gardens, we would love to invite you all to come visit someday. 
 just 
And while you're there, you can also see Green School -- we keep building classrooms there each year -- as well as an updated fairy mushroom house. 
well
But until recently, it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects, and so, just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone. 
 just 
The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here. 
well
And bamboo model-making, it's an art, as well as some hardcore engineering. 
well
Well, its hinges battle with gravity, and gravity will always win in the end, so why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced? 
well
How do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you've just built? 
 just 
Instead of seeing the broken things, you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better. 
you see
And few things give me greater joy than a well-designed flag. 
well
There's just something about them that works on our emotions. 
 just 
I put this picture online, and sure enough, within the first few minutes, someone left a comment that said, "You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass."  Which -- see, people are passionate about flags, you know? 
you know
RM: Well, I didn't know that. That's Ted Kaye, by the way. 
well
WM: Today, just for example, I went to get a haircut, and when I sat down in the barber's chair, there was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in, and then in the mirror there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me. 
 just 
RM: And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag. 
 just 
RM: Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008, I researched its flag, because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there. 
okay
 TK: Well, let me start from the top. 
well
RM: Okay, here we go. Okay. 
okay
Design-wise, it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time, which if you were trying for that, you wouldn't be able to do it, and it just looks bad at a distance, but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column. 
 just 
RM: I think it's okay. But --  -- here come the big no-nos of flag design. 
okay
A lot of people tend to think that good design is just a matter of taste, and quite honestly, sometimes it is, actually, but sometimes it isn't, all right? 
 just 
And like I said before, most country flags are okay. 
okay
We just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags, or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them. 
 just 
You know, yeah.  But instead, the flag of Amsterdam looks like this. 
you know
Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing "Amsterdam" below it, they just take the key elements of the escutcheon, the shield, and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world. 
 just 
  And because it's so badass, those flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam, just like Chicago, they're used. 
 just 
 I mean, it's distinctive, I'll give them that. 
i mean
SK: So that's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous, that there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag. 
 just 
RM: They couldn't agree to change that thing!  That's discouraging enough to make you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together. 
 just 
If you see your city flag and like it, fly it, even if it violates a design rule or two. 
you see
But if you don't see your city flag, maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does, and it just sucks, and I dare you to join the effort to try to change that. 
 just 
As we move more and more into cities, the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place, but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself, especially today, as the populace is becoming more design-aware. 
 just 
A well-designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems: its public transit, its parks, its signage. 
well
When they are done well, they are remixable, adaptable, and they are powerful. 
well
And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy. 
 just 
That thing has a trademark symbol on it, people.  That hurts me just to look at. 
 just 
In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court held that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person, and in 2012, just recently, there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and the crown, in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed. 
 just 
Well now James' godparents swung into action. 
well
Well, Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat, because if James Somerset was a legal thing, he was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus, only if he could be a legal person. 
well
We decided upon chimpanzees, not just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors, but because they, Jane and others, have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades. 
 just 
I wouldn't blame you, because every time I look at this Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit. 
 just 
I was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway, just inside the Arctic Circle, and the water was hovering right at freezing. 
 just 
  Man: I mean, I know we were hoping for good waves, but I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen. 
i mean
I don't even know if it's a real job title, to be honest. 
to be honest
I mean, to me, this was it. Life could not get any better. 
i mean
But there was just this one problem. 
 just 
You see, the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations, the less gratifying it seemed to be. 
you see
So in my search to break up this monotony, I realized something: There's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm, and it's really just that thin band around the equator. 
 just 
They created this barrier between us and the surf, and we had to weave through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup. 
 just 
And one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there: hours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to. 
 just 
And once we got there, the vehicles were just as creative: snowmobiles, six-wheel Soviet troop carriers, and a couple of super-sketchy helicopter flights. 
 just 
 Helicopters really scare me, by the way. 
by the way
We were in this tiny, remote fjord, just inside the Arctic Circle. 
 just 
So I just did whatever I could. I shook it off, whatever. 
 just 
Anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit, and that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography, it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines. 
 just 
It's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits and even the struggle that it took just to get there, but most of all, what I see is just joy. 
 just 
Every book, every newspaper article, every song, every TV program -- there is just one subject. 
 just 
It took me a while to understand the different types of lies; they lie to shield their system from the world, or they were taught lies, and were just regurgitating them. 
 just 
Although those were just homework, and would never reach their intended recipients, my students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them. 
 just 
She went each week to physical therapy, but just like me, she barely followed the home treatment, and it took her over five months to feel better. 
 just 
I control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion, just like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off. 
 just 
I have just shown you three different games for kids, adults and seniors. 
 just 
Cosmin Milhau: So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo, but you just need a computer and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars. 
 just 
Chris Anderson: So I guess what we're going to do is we're going to talk about your life, and using some pictures that you shared with me. 
i guess
Okay, now who is this? 
okay
CA: Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine. 
okay
I saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles, and we later began living together, but the moment I saw her, I saw just an aura of energy around her. 
 just 
of the oceans of the sky, and as I developed different types of satellite communication systems, the main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites, the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas could be smaller and smaller, and after going through direct television broadcasting, I had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite, the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish, 
 just 
MR: It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children, and I discussed with each of them that I felt my soul was always female, and as a woman, but I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it, so I always kept it bottled up and just showed my male side. 
 just 
That's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts, and people could choose whatever gender they want if they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female the way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white. 
 just 
CA:  Okay, now, this is your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis. 
okay
And I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened. 
i guess
MR: Well, we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could. 
well
However, there is a medicine that was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company that could halt the progression of the disease, but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome. 
well
MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren't going to out-license the drug to a satellite communications expert, they weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all, and they thought I didn't have the expertise, finally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me and develop enough credibility. 
well
I wore down their resistance, and they had no hope this drug would even work, by the way, and they tried to tell me, "You're just wasting your time. 
 just 
MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up -- after I wrote the check for 25,000, and I said, "Okay, where's the medicine for Jenesis?" 
 oh 
This is just something we tried in rats." 
 just 
And how much have you paid Glaxo, by the way, after that 25,000? 
by the way
MR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them 10 percent of 1.5 billion, 150 million dollars, last year 100 million dollars. 
well
It's the best return on investment they ever received.  CA: And the best news of all, I guess, is this. 
i guess
You see me, Bina and Jenesis there. 
you see
The most amazing thing about Jenesis is that while she could do anything with her life, and believe me, if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you've got a fatal disease, I would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again. 
 just 
The only cure for pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of, is a lung transplant, but sadly, there are only enough available lungs for 2,000 people in the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant, whereas nearly a half million people a year die of end-stage lung failure. 
 just 
MR: So I conceptualize the possibility that just like we keep cars and planes and buildings going forever with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts, why can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs to keep people living indefinitely, and especially people with lung disease. 
 just 
CA: But it's not just bodies that -- though that is amazing. 
 just 
 It's not just long-lasting bodies that are of interest to you now. 
 just 
MR: Well, Chris, what we're working on is creating a situation where people can create a mind file, and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms, personality, recollection, feelings, beliefs, attitudes and values, everything that we've poured today into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook, and all of this information stored there will be able, in the next couple decades, once software is able to recapitulate consciousness, be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file. 
well
CA: Now you're not just messing around with this. 
 just 
You're serious. I mean, who is this? 
i mean
MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody. 
 just 
You know, it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you. 
you know
CA: So the thing is, Martine, that in any normal conversation, this would sound stark-staring mad, but in the context of your life, what you've done, some of the things we've heard this week, the constructed realities that our minds give, I mean, you wouldn't bet against it. 
i mean
MR: Well, I think it's really nothing coming from me. 
well
Bina, could we invite you to the stage? I just have to ask you one question. 
 just 
I mean, look, when you got married, if someone had told you that, in a few years time, the man you were marrying would become a woman, and a few years after that, you would become a robot --  -- how has this gone? How has it been? 
i mean
Bina Rothblatt: It's been really an exciting journey, and I would have never thought that at the time, but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things, and before you knew it, we just keep going up and up and we're still not stopping, so it's great. 
 just 
CA: Martine told me something really beautiful, just actually on Skype before this, which was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years as a mind file, but not if it wasn't with you. 
 just 
We're cryonicists as well, and we want to wake up together. 
well
CA: So just so as you know, from my point of view, this isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard, it's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard. 
you know
It's just a delight to have you both here at TED. 
 just 
Behind me you see an amazing view, a picture that was taken from the International Space Station, and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored. 
you see
And after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that. 
 just 
So with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24. 
well
Roswell's a great place to launch balloons, but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute, especially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started. 
well
And then here you see the suit going on. 
you see
This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon, and I was about 4,000 feet from release. 
 just 
And there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second, because that's really important. 
 just 
I thought I was the only one happy, but it turns out mission control was really happy as well. 
well
So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you. 
 just 
And before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning, or you can release this drogue late, in which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour, and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful. 
you know
And she looks at me and she goes, "Dad, after what you just did, how can you call anything impossible?" 
 just 
And I laughed, and I said, "OK, it's not impossible, it's just very, very hard." 
 just 
And then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn, it may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard, it's just that I don't know how to do it." 
 just 
You know, this question has been around for thousands of years, since at least the time of the Greek philosophers. 
you know
But I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting to finding out the answer to this question. 
 just 
Knowing that small planets are very common, you can just do the math. 
 just 
And there are just so many stars and so many planets out there, that surely, there must be life somewhere out there. 
 just 
Well, the biologists get furious with me for saying that, because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet. 
well
Well, if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside and zoom in to where our sun is, we see a real map of the stars. 
well
This is really just the tip of the iceberg. 
 just 
And you'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun. 
well
And by the way, most of these exoplanets, we don't know too much about. 
by the way
This planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star, so that the temperature may be just right for life. 
 just 
Here, the artist's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like. 
 just 
But actually, we just work on our computers like everyone else, and we get our data by email or downloading from a database. 
 just 
That's because Kepler-186f orbits a red star, and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there, if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis, it has different pigments and looks red. 
 just 
So out of all these planets out there, and the variety is just simply astonishing, we mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets, we call them. 
 just 
Not too big, not too small, not too hot, not too cold -- but just right for life. 
 just 
Well, science fiction got some things wrong. 
well
Well, we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres, although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that. 
well
And I'll just never forget when I started working on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago, how many people told me, "This will never happen. 
 just 
Well, you know, our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to 20 percent by volume. 
well
 Well, I had my own crazy theory. 
well
Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me." 
well
They also exist for other reasons, but just life even produces ozone. 
 just 
And so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out on which types of exoplanets, which gases could be attributed to life. 
 just 
And so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won't know if they're being produced by intelligent aliens or by trees, or a swamp, or even just by simple, single-celled microbial life. 
 just 
So working on the models and thinking about biochemistry, it's all well and good. 
well
And actually, I just finished leading a two-year project in this very special phase of a concept we call the starshade. 
 just 
Just so you believe it's not just in movie format, here's a real photograph of a second-generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab. 
 just 
And in this case, I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space. 
 just 
Well, in the best case, we will find an image of another exo-Earth. 
well
And that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics. 
 just 
SS: Well, the thing is that as scientists, we're supposed to be skeptical, because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not. 
well
I would have said just to be a good pastor, to be able to be with people through all the passages of life, to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks, and in the African-American tradition, to be able to represent the community that I serve. 
 just 
You'd hear it almost every night, when you were cooking dinner, telling your child a bedtime story, or just watching TV. 
 just 
But the violence just careened out of control, and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed: somebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store, or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus, or kids who were playing in the park, oblivious to the violence on the other side of the park, but it coming and visiting them. 
 just 
I mean, isn't this a law enforcement issue? 
i mean
As soon as the question, "Why me?" came, the answer came just as quickly: Why me? Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it. 
 just 
I mean, isn't that how movements start anyway? 
i mean
But it starts with just a few, or maybe just one. 
 just 
I mean, we weren't drug dealers. 
i mean
  All right, come on, you're cutting into my time now, okay?  But it was amazing. 
okay
And they were all too happy to do that, and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about, very different than what you see on the 11 o'clock news, very different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media. 
you see
Most of the young people who were out there on the streets are just trying to make it on the streets. 
 just 
And as a result of that, we said to them, "How do you see this church, how do you see this institution helping this situation?" 
you see
It can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out in the community. 
 just 
 Let me just set something out from the outset: Unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination. 
 just 
Well, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently, but there was the perception that they did. 
well
Now hands up -- and it's okay -- but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy? 
okay
There's evidence that that unconscious bias exists, but we all just have to acknowledge that it's there so that we can look at solutions. 
 just 
The unconscious bias is there, but we just have to look at how we can move past it. 
 just 
And, you know, it's interesting, there's some research that talks about why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox. 
you know
So you guys think you've got a good read on me, you kinda think you know what's up. 
you know
Well, I'm glad you can. 
well
Well, fortunately, we've identified that there's a problem. 
well
If you enroll in private high school tutoring, go to your local state school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center. 
 just 
These include the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, as well as failed attacks, such as the time when a man named Faisal Shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square. 
well
It's really just theater, a national security theater, with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac unwitting actors in a carefully choreographed production brought to you by the FBI. 
 just 
So my story in The Intercept, which was just published today, tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting and goes into much greater detail. 
 just 
TA: Well so far, we only know what's come out in the court file, but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same. 
well
There's babies and there's grandparents, I'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set, and it's going, going, and I've got one sheet of film left, and I think, I'm okay, I'm in control, I'm in control. 
okay
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up, and the light's just about to go, and I want it to be golden, I want it to be beautiful. 
 just 
It took me a week, it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today, and I'll tell you why.  It's very, very, very simple -- I spent a week going around the village, and I went to every single one: "Hello, can you meet at the tree? 
you see
I mean, I have teenage kids. I should know. 
i mean
It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand. 
 just 
It wasn't about just saying, "I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer." 
 just 
So in the end, a week later, and I was absolutely exhausted, I mean on my knees going, "Please get back up in that tree. 
i mean
But anyway, the effort that goes into that picture and the story that I've just related to you, as you can imagine, there are hundreds of other bizarre, eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world. 
 just 
And this was about four years ago, and I set off on a journey, to be honest, a very indulgent journey. 
to be honest
I really didn't have the answers, and I could sort of understand, okay, they're beautiful, that was my intention, but the questions that I was being fired at, I could not answer them. 
okay
I thought, lessons, okay, well, what did I learn? Good question. 
well
 And I thought, three lessons, well, I'm going to think about it. 
well
And I thought long and hard about it, and I thought, well, the only thing I can communicate is very, very basic. 
well
So I kept running and I kept running, and I sort of got somewhere and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought, well, where do I belong? Where do I fit? 
well
And images like this, I mean, this is what it's all about for me. 
i mean
And you know why they're proud? You know why they look like this, and why I broke my back literally to photograph them and present them to you? 
you know
You'll be okay. We'll find them." So off we went on this journey. 
okay
You have to wait until you see how we interact with one another." 
you see
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, you've given each other compliments. 
okay
So I wanted this debate. It was very, very, very emotional, and one night we were sitting around the campfire, and I have to be honest, I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink, and I was sort of sitting under the stars going, "This is great, you've seen my pictures, we love each other."  And I'm a little bit slow, and I looked around me, and I said, 
to be honest
You know, this big protective fence around the village, and they sort of looked at me and go, "Yeah, chief die." 
you know
And I thought, okay, chief dying, right, you know, look up at the stars again, look at the campfire. 
you know
Well, there's an image I'd like to show you, quite a special image, and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose. 
well
I don't ultimately have the answers, as I've just shared with you, but you must do. There must be something there. 
 just 
You have to stand tall, breathe in through your nose, and I'm going to photograph you. Okay? 
okay
I need to do a panoramic shot, so it's going to take a minute, so you have to concentrate, okay? 
okay
I'm going to give you just two examples today. 
 just 
Well, babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time. 
well
I'm going to show you two movies, one from each of two conditions of an experiment, and because you're going to see just two movies, you're going to see just two babies, and any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways. 
 just 
In each movie, you're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do, and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are. 
 just 
So maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well. 
well
 Hyowon Gweon: See this?  Did you see that?  Cool. 
you see
  LS: So you just saw two 15-month-old babies based only on the probability of the sample they observed. 
 just 
And this leads to a fun prediction: Suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box. 
 just 
You [probably won't] pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box, but you could randomly sample just one blue ball. 
 just 
So even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking, and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw, we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more, and that's exactly what we found. 
 just 
LS: Okay, Laura, but of course, babies love their mommies. 
okay
I've just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points, because the really critical point is that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species-specific cultural learning that we do. 
 just 
Children learn about new tools from just a few examples. 
 just 
They learn new causal relationships from just a few examples. 
 just 
I want to close with just two points. 
 just 
It's a story about minds and not brains, and in particular, it's a story about the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform, which involve rich, structured knowledge and the ability to learn from small amounts of data, the evidence of just a few examples. 
 just 
If we invest in these most powerful learners and their development, in babies and children and mothers and fathers and caregivers and teachers the ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms of technology, engineering and design, we will not just be dreaming of a better future, we will be planning for one. 
 just 
I mean, who would design an experiment like that?  I've seen that a couple of times, and I still don't honestly believe that that can truly be happening, but other people have done similar experiments; it checks out. 
i mean
LS: You know, they look really impressive in our experiments, but think about what they look like in real life, right? 
you know
Eighteen months later, it's talking to you, and babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks, they're things like "all gone," which refer to disappearance, or "uh-oh," which refer to unintentional actions. 
 just 
There are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day You know about objects and their properties. 
you know
You know them when they're occluded. You know them in the dark. 
you know
You can navigate space. You know about numbers. 
you know
You know causal relationships. You know about moral reasoning. 
you know
I mean, you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology as a matter of practice, but it's not just a difference in quantity, it's a difference in kind. 
 just 
I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage, but he once said, "Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face."  And I think that's so true about business as well. 
well
And funding, I think as well, if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction, especially in today's age, it's very, very easy to get intense funding. 
well
Well, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought, "No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger." 
well
And to be really, really honest about it, not be in denial about any results that you see, because if you have something you love, you want to push it forward, but you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing. 
you see
It's a cramped, tiny space and it's just three feet away from the train tracks. 
 just 
Well that's great, we can get in and out of the store quickly. 
well
When we get home and we're hungry and we see this ripe, juicy piece of fruit on the counter, we just want to pick it up and eat it. 
 just 
Then rolling up that sticker -- you know what I mean. 
you know
You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit. 
 just 
You just wanted to dive in. 
 just 
By the 10th time, you started to become less upset and you just started peeling the label off. 
 just 
And if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems, well, then that's really bad. 
well
He tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower. 
 just 
He just wanted a comfortable shower. 
 just 
But designers, innovators and entrepreneurs, it's our job to not just notice those things, but to go one step further and try to fix them. 
 just 
Now probably, most of those passengers just thought, "It's a fact of life, he's got to open the window to clean it. 
 just 
That's just how it is." 
 just 
I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge before use. 
 just 
Well, Steve noticed that and he said, "We're not going to let that happen to our product." 
well
Well, first off, we could make a higher quality product, be easy to test, and make sure it was great for the customer. 
well
So that customer, with all that exhilaration, could just start using the product. 
 just 
But back then, we noticed that detail and we fixed it, and now everyone else does that as well. 
well
Well, it's seeing the invisible problem, not just the obvious problem, that's important, not just for product design, but for everything we do. 
well
You see, there are invisible problems all around us, ones we can solve. 
you see
You see, when you're tackling a problem, sometimes, there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem. 
you see
Instead of just turning up and down, you now had to program it. 
 just 
Well, people couldn't predict the future. 
well
They just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season, year to year. 
 just 
But still, years later, people were not saving any energy because they just couldn't predict the future. 
 just 
And you know what? 
you know
We went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right. 
 just 
With that custom little screw, there was just one screw in the box, that was easy to mount and put on the wall. 
 just 
He looked at me, puzzled, and said, "Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail?"  I was like, "That's a pretty good question." 
 just 
We say, "Son, that's just the way the world works." 
 just 
And if we do, maybe, just maybe, we can get rid of these dumb little stickers. 
 just 
And she said, "I don't think that's actually the case; because if it were, we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this." 
 just 
I remember the thick, straight hair, and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up; her soft, southern Thai accent; the way I would cling to her, even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat. 
 just 
I became so hysterical over her treatment, that eventually, she was just beaten behind closed doors. 
 just 
As an adult, I learned later that she had been just 19 when she was brought over from Thailand to the States to care for me, on a tourist visa. 
 just 
That story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation, though. 
 just 
Let me show you what I mean. 
i mean
Human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that, and in places you would never even imagine. 
 just 
And don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you?" 
you know
We often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization. 
well
These survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet, other workers, and for the possibility of a just world for all of us. 
 just 
Figuring out how to build a more just world is our work to do, and our story to tell. 
 just 
The students were just scared: scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen; scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food. 
 just 
"Why can't we just do what we want to do?" 
 just 
And as we lead, we must never forget that every single one of our students is just a child, often scared by what the world tells them they should be, and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be, we should always provide them with hope, our undivided attention, unwavering belief in their potential, consistent expectations, and we must tell them often, if nobody told them they loved them today, 
 just 
It's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel," which I did on Broadway, and this one, I -- thank you -- I've excerpted it just for you, so here we go. 
 just 
So class, hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- z Very good, the cellular phone announcement. 
 just 
And --  -- and along the gender continuum, I will be living into males as well. 
well
I know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention, but since we are trying to experience what our forebears did, right, let's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading, okay? 
 just 
Right. Please toggle them off. Okay? 
okay
All right. I understand. If you're unwilling to -- All right, well, we can discuss that after class. 
well
Okay. After class. Okay? After class. 
okay
Let's just get started, okay. 
 just 
Okay honey, now, I'm ready when you are. 
okay
Yes, oh the cold is for the machines, the new technology. Okay. 
 oh 
Right, right, so people will be able to feel my experience and my memory? Okay. 
okay
I just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing. 
 just 
Okay. 
okay
No, well, I guess when I was a girl, we didn't really have a name for that either. 
well
We would have said dirty magazines, I suppose, or dirty movies. 
i suppose
Well, it's not like what you have with the Internet. 
well
No, well, I don't mind sharing. 
well
Well, as you get older, you know, at one point I thought my husband might be helped by using some of the pills men can take, but he wasn't interested in those, so I thought, what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet? 
well
Well, at the time, neither of us were very good on the computer, so usually, if we needed help with the Internet, we would just call our children or our grandchildren, but obviously, in this case, that wasn't an option, so I thought, I'll have a look myself, just to see. 
well
You search for certain key words and you look -- Oh wow is right, young man. 
 oh 
Well, first of all, I was just trying to find, you know, couples, normal couples making love, but this, so many people together at one time. 
well
There was lots of making of something, but they took the love part right out of it, you know, the fun. 
you know
It was all very extreme, you know? 
you know
So anyway, needless to say, that was $19.95 I'll never get back again, but it only showed up on the credit card as "entertainment services," so my husband was never the wiser, and after all of that, well, you could say it turned out he didn't need the extra inspiration after all. 
well
 Yeah, I just want to, like, get a recording of, like, you guys recording me, like a meta recording, or whatever. 
 just 
It's just like this whole experience is just, like, really amazing, and I'd like to capture that for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr. 
 just 
It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" --  -- and it's in Beekman Hall, and, what else, like, non-Jell-O shots are also available for vegans, and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we should also focus on your questions also. 
okay
 Yes, well, of course, like, I consider myself to be, like, obviously, like, a feminist. 
well
Well, like, I guess I would ask, like, what do you think sex-negative is?  Yeah, because, like, the terms that we use are, like, so important, because, like, we call it sex work because it helps people understand that, like, it's work, and, like, you know, just like there are, like, healthcare providers and, like, insurance providers, like, we think of these workers as, like, sex care providers. 
well
Yeah, I was telling you, you know, I think I have in all my time I have had at least one client with that name, so this won't be the first time I had BERT all over me. 
you know
But you see the sign? You get it? P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us. 
you see
I was a nanny; I was a home care attendant for all these different old people, and then I said, child, if I have to touch another white man's backside, I might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this, you understand? 
well
Pshh, you know how hard it is being a domestic worker? 
you know
Well, you have to have a sense of humor about it, that's what I think. 
well
I mean, there's a lot of things about this job that I hate, but the money is not one of them, and I will tell you, as long as this is the best possibility for me to make real money, I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin' if that's what they want to call me. 
i mean
They don't know what I do, but you know what? 
you know
Right.  Thanks, that's lovely, and just the cup of tea, love, and just a splash of the whiskey. 
 just 
It's perfect, that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect. 
 just 
Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy. 
well
Well no, that older fella, he would still come to find me in the convent. 
well
Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in love with another fella much older than me, and I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink, I married the bastard. 
well
Well, he didn't drink, but he did have just the wee heroin problem, didn't he, and -- That's right, and before I knew it, he was the one who turned me on to the prostitution, my own husband. 
well
Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman, I can tell you that. 
well
Well, for your record, my opinion of the legalization, I'd say I'm against it. 
well
You know, living like that, you're just lost, and, you know, I'm 63 years old. 
you know
You know, I never was a wife or a nun, or a prostitute even, really, not really. 
you know
They just told me, and if you legalize it, then you're really telling these girls, "Go on and get lost for a living," and a lot of them, they'll do as they're told. 
 just 
Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point. 
okay
Valerie, right? Okay, very good. 
okay
And so we'll just very briefly, class -- we don't have a lot of time -- we'll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this stage. 
 just 
Dude, can you, all right, can you just keep it down? 
 just 
No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober, so I just want to be helpful. 
 just 
 No, but I mean, like, just because I'm in a strip club parking lot doesn't mean that I'm, like, a sexist or whatever. 
 just 
All right, okay, so Anderson, so, like, first of all, stripping, but then, like, all the other things you're talking about, prostitution and all that stuff, that's, like, not the same thing at all. 
okay
You know? Like, you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever, but it's like, if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer and she's 18, like, that's her right. 
you know
Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying, but I just feel like people, they just want to make it seem like all dudes are just, like, predators, that we would just automatically go to a prostitute, or whatever. 
 just 
Even, like, when I pledged, you know, like when I rushed my fraternity. 
you know
We're just normal people, but, like, there's this myth that you must be that guy who is kind of an asshole, and like, all bros before hos or whatever. 
 just 
It's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first. 
 just 
I mean, like, if you go watch "Hangover 2," and you think that's an instruction manual for your life, like, I don't know what to tell you. 
i mean
You know? You don't watch "Bourne Identity" and go drive your car over a gondola in Venice.  Well, yeah, okay, like, if you're a little kid or whatever, of course it's different, but -- Yeah, all right, I remember one thing like that. 
well
No, I don't think I said anything, I just finished playing and went home. 
 just 
All right class, so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue.  The next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned motivational speaker, life coach and therapist, but if you want to know more about him, you'll have to come to the entire play. 
 just 
I was a computer scientist in Egypt, and I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University. 
 just 
What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly, just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would? 
 just 
It does recognize subtle smiles as well. 
well
This is just a slimmed-down demo. 
 just 
So valence is how positive or negative an experience is, and engagement is how expressive she is as well. 
well
But perhaps what surprised us the most about this data is that we happen to be expressive all the time, even when we are sitting in front of our devices alone, and it's not just when we're watching cat videos on Facebook. 
 just 
In education, imagine if your learning apps sense that you're confused and slow down, or that you're bored, so it's sped up, just like a great teacher would in a classroom. 
 just 
What if, when I was in Cambridge, I had access to my real-time emotion stream, and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way, just like I would've if we were all in the same room together? 
 just 
I think five years down the line, all our devices are going to have an emotion chip, and we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device and our device would say, "Hmm, you didn't like that, did you?" 
 just 
It had nothing to do with hating my body, I just love it enough to let it go, I treat it like a house, and when your house is falling apart, you do not evacuate, you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides, you make it pretty enough to invite guests over, you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on. 
 just 
Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins, to misspell their names on gravestones. 
you see
Maybe I am finally fixed, maybe I just don't care, maybe God finally listened to my prayers. 
 just 
 I mean, the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing. 
i mean
She was a devout conservative Catholic, a believer in traditional family values, stereotypical roles of men and women, and I was, well, me. 
well
She could have called her my friend, or my "friend," or my "special friend" --  -- or even worse, just not asked at all. 
 just 
People often say to me, "Well, Ash, I don't care. 
well
You don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff, you learn it from the grit. 
 just 
And what if duality is just the first step? 
 just 
What can you do to hold just a few more? 
 just 
 And her humanity, her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately, then I give her a: "It's okay, it happens. But thanks." 
okay
Did you see the look on her face? This was the greatest day of her life!" 
you see
He was interested in productivity -- I think it's something that concerns all of us -- but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs. 
 just 
Chickens live in groups, so first of all, he selected just an average flock, and he let it alone for six generations. 
 just 
Well, the first group, the average group, was doing just fine. 
well
Well, all but three were dead. 
well
And the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment: aggression, dysfunction and waste. 
 just 
Well, that's the question a team at MIT took to research. 
well
Well, it means that what happens between people really counts, because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other, ideas can flow and grow. 
well
Helpfulness means I don't have to know everything, I just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help. 
 just 
Now that sounds so obvious, and we think it'll just happen normally, but it doesn't. 
 just 
So I started to wonder, well, if we start working this way, does that mean no more stars? 
well
And when I reflected on my own career, and the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with, I realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be superchickens. 
 just 
Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up, causing crippling, chronic pain. 
well
The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York. 
 just 
You know, on that particular day, a voice rang out over the circus P.A. system. 
you know
Pain just kept accumulating in his life. 
 just 
But the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job -- he was jittery, and in applying the ether, irritated Emma's throat. 
 just 
Healing others became more than just his job, it was his own most effective form of relief. 
 just 
It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient, a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms. 
 just 
So Lane, an Iraq War veteran -- you see her here on my left -- decided she was going to go on Amazon and order a pair of Spanx to her base, so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night. 
you see
They would swap jokes, they would talk about what was working, what wasn't, what they had learned to do well, what they needed to do better. 
well
Women live in the and every single day, and these women brought that to this mission as well. 
well
But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of 2011, he told his fellow Ranger, "We have just witnessed history. 
 just 
These may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen." 
well
And at her funeral, the head of Army Special Operations came, and gave a public testimony not just to the courage of Ashley White, but to all her team of sisters. 
 just 
You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person, that turns out to be 162 lifetimes spent every day, wasted, just getting from A to B. 
 just 
He's an incredibly capable guy, but he just happens to be blind, and that means instead of a 30-minute drive to work in the morning, it's a two-hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride. 
 just 
Now, conventional wisdom would say that we'll just take these driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them, and over time, they'll turn into self-driving cars. 
 just 
Well, I'm here to tell you that's like me saying that if I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll be able to fly. 
well
Well, almost regular -- they were 100 Googlers, but they weren't working on the project. 
well
So by just making the cars incrementally smarter, we're probably not going to see the wins we really need. 
 just 
We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two. 
 just 
And then that all turns into just following a path: turning the steering wheel left or right, pressing the brake or gas. 
 just 
It's really just two numbers at the end of the day. 
 just 
You see pedestrians crossing in front of us, cars crossing in front of us, going every which way, the traffic lights, crosswalks. 
you see
So here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right, but not just construction in isolation, of course. 
 just 
It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well. 
well
And of course, if anyone's breaking the rules, the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it's not just a car, it's actually a police officer. 
 just 
Similarly, the orange box on the side here, it's a school bus, and we have to treat that differently as well. 
well
Now, that's all well and good for things that we've seen, but of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before. 
well
And so just a couple of months ago, our vehicles were driving through Mountain View, and this is what we encountered. 
 just 
Now, we don't have to deal with just ducks. 
 just 
Here, as we make a lane change, the car to our left decides it wants to as well. 
well
And similarly, here, a cyclist blowing through that light as well. 
well
 Now, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there, so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly. 
 just 
Well, it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem, but these are my two boys. 
well
What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point, and then a driver is going to say, "This feels safe," and climb into the back, and something ugly will happen. 
 just 
After three months at sea, age just 24, I finished in second position. 
 just 
This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board. 
well
I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning, speaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists to try to understand just how our global economy works. 
 just 
This is a photo of him, and when you see that photo, you see someone from another era. 
you see
No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age.  But yet, that's me with my great-grandfather, and by the way, they are not his real ears.  We were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories. 
by the way
And I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime, and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil. 
well
And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy. 
 just 
With more people in the world with more stuff, we've effectively seen 100 years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years. 
 just 
We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there, and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010. 
 just 
All of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas, they're real today, and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy. 
 just 
Well, the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world, with leading businesses within the world, with the biggest convening platforms in the world, and with governments. 
well
When he was born, there were only 25 cars in the world; they had only just been invented. 
 just 
Many said it wouldn't catch on, but it did, and just 20 years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands in this room here today. 
 just 
 Well, I have had a great blessing as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe. 
well
A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position, a subservient position to men. 
well
Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much.  So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women. 
 just 
And sometimes, in more extreme cases but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate. 
 just 
In the United States, we take just the opposite position. 
 just 
Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know.  And this is sometimes misinterpreted, but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man. 
you know
So we've made some progress, partially because I was president and so forth --   -- but in the last 15 years, there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years. 
 just 
Well, that's what goes on in our country. 
well
But during that time, there were many white people that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing that exists today, because the average man really doesn't care. 
okay
Well, it's all of us. 
well
And if you don't know them, that's okay. Most casual players probably do. 
okay
So how does this work? Well, it's by example. 
well
Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players, it changes how we look at the game. 
 just 
 Okay, I will! It was four. 
okay
I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. 
well
This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. 
 just 
I was going through a hard time as well. 
well
You know what the women said to me? 
you know
I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. 
well
Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. 
 just 
We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community, but even in other communities. 
 just 
We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women, as we are in this room, we are not just women, we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. 
 just 
And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced? 
you know
The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there, they need to be publicized at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. 
 just 
This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology, which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories, like the ones you see behind me. 
you see
And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia -- arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man -- we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent, just like a network. 
 just 
I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well, in your own corporations, or others. 
well
But humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way, and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure. 
well
The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004. 
you see
And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network into three different years, represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. 
you see
But networks are not just a scientific metaphor. 
 just 
This is just one of many examples, where you can see this influence from science into art. 
 just 
And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful. 
 just 
But networks are also not just a new trend, and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such. 
 just 
And coincidentally or not, I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge -- the brain -- and the largest scale of knowledge -- the universe itself -- to be really quite striking and fascinating. 
 just 
It was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I worked together as bartenders. 
well
I'd graduated from college just a few months earlier and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant. 
 just 
But as much as abortion is hotly debated, it's still rare for us, whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people, to talk with one another about the abortions that we have. 
 just 
This isn't just about abortion. 
 just 
They have a terminal illness, their mother just died, they have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it. 
 just 
I wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you, or that there's a long-lost sisterhood of people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed. 
 just 
There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple. 
 just 
You can ask yourself or someone that you know, "How are you feeling?" 
you know
He told me, "It seems like the United States has run out of jobs, because they're just making some up: cat psychologist, dog whisperer, tornado chaser." 
 just 
But I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion, not just my own, but all of the world's major faiths. 
 just 
You have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want, and you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace. 
you know
When my mom's favorite lamp broke, I had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who, because I had to defend myself, because if you're not, then the finger is pointed at you, and before you know it, you will be grounded. 
you know
I decided to use their defense as my offense, and I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well. 
well
So really, the United Nations just copied us. 
 just 
And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? 
 just 
So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if I could learn from them. 
okay
 Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment. 
 just 
It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie.  And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander. 
 just 
You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. 
 just 
Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us. 
 just 
Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know -- But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time. 
you know
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped. 
 just 
One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system. 
well
Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group, and we've created a society where, for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park. 
 just 
Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. 
 just 
He said, "When you get that feeling, you just go with it." 
 just 
What's more beautiful, I thought to myself, this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades? 
 just 
And I suspect if you had put spiders in there, the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart. 
 just 
Well, why is that? 
well
Some of it, of course, is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them. 
 just 
Which, given this, is probably just as well. 
well
But that's just not the case. 
 just 
 Okay, they would not be able to do that very often. 
okay
In the social insects -- the bees and wasps and ants -- the individuals that you see every day -- the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl, the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower -- all of those are always female. 
you see
The ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees, the drones, that are larger than the workers, although they disapproved of the drones' laziness because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive until the mating flight -- they're the males. They hang around until the mating flight, but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen. 
 just 
Aristotle tried to get involved as well. 
well
And you know, even today, my students, for instance, call every animal they see, including insects, a male. 
you know
Well, what difference does this make? 
well
I think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them. 
 just 
Well, the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them. 
well
And so, we can't just think of them as though they're little people because they don't do things the way that we do. 
 just 
Now, you know, people write fiction and talk about parallel universes. 
you know
And, "Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath." 
 just 
 You know, when we watch courtroom dramas, we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney, but give us the power, and we become like hanging judges. 
you know
And then she got to Heathrow, and she had a little time to spare before her final leg, so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke: [Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!] And she chuckled to herself, pressed send, got on the plane, got no replies, turned off her phone, fell asleep, woke up 11 hours later, turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway, 
 just 
In fact, when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar, she was just crushed, and I asked her to explain the joke, and she said, "Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the Third World. 
 just 
You know, another woman on Twitter that night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis, she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night, "I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist," and she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying, "Well, you're just a privileged bitch, too." 
well
You know, Justine's name was normally Googled 40 times a month. 
you know
[It is kinda wild to see someone self-destruct without them even being aware of it. #hasJustineLandedYet] [Seriously. I just want to go home to go to bed, but everyone at the bar is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet. Can't look away. Can't leave.] [#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night.] [Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival? 
 just 
And do you know what that's the opposite of? 
you know
By the way, it's mandatory reading for everybody, okay? 
okay
JR: It didn't go down that well with some people. 
well
 I mean, you don't want to just concentrate -- because lots of people understood, and were really nice about the book. 
 just 
As soon as I say, "We are the powerful people abusing our power now," I get people saying, "Well you must be a racist too." 
well
And everyone changes as well. 
well
People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease, instead of with the human being. 
well
I talked to it and I said, "Okay, cancer, you're not all there is to me. 
okay
Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well, and this was the most important part of La Cura. 
well
[Society] The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components. 
well
At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. 
 just 
For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. 
 just 
It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe -- actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here -- There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York. 
 just 
Because then, if my fake place shows up on your map, I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me. 
well
Well, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting. 
well
And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. 
 just 
And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't, and then people would threaten me, you know, they'd threaten me with this "going on [my] permanent record," or "You'll never get a good job." 
you know
I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation -- all of these things, by the way, enriched my life on a literally daily basis. 
by the way
It's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking, "I think I'll draw that bit of land," and then wondering, "Maybe there's some more land to draw." 
you know
And I said, "I don't know, like, six hours?" and he said, "Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways, you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart." 
 just 
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets, but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea. 
you know
But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography, instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more. 
you see
So, I had one learning community in high school, then I went to another for college, and then I went to another, when I started working at a magazine called "Booklist," where I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people. 
well
I read books about Stalin, and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims, and I read books about how to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles, and then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners, a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us. 
 just 
I didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet. 
 just 
 Ze isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder, and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. 
 just 
But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s? 
well
First, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field. 
 just 
So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph -- now that is a mustache! 
well
Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France, because, you know, France. 
you know
 And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube. 
 just 
So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum. 
i guess
Or is it that the singular should be changed: one "serie," or "serum," just like the singular of "sheep" should be "shoop." 
 just 
You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement, instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions -- you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus." 
you know
 And I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started. 
 just 
They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, "Well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?" 
well
And Rumsfeld's answer is, "Well, we don't do body counts on other people." 
well
I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. 
 just 
Matt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the "Improvised Empathetic Device" which accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data, it would stab me in the arm. 
 just 
I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better. 
i guess
There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function. 
 just 
Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented. 
 just 
They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented. 
 just 
But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. 
 just 
But then came along these master storytellers -- the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers -- and they tell us a very convincing story: "Look, you see this green piece of paper? 
you see
BG: In the book, if I understand it correctly, you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better, but they will create -- and I quote you -- "... new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did." 
 just 
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now, that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality, we are just kind of at the beginning of the process? 
 just 
Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name; a place with splendid vistas; a place where you can drive just 20 minutes and put your sailboat on the water. 
 just 
He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing. 
 just 
We don't think we're better than you, we just want to be away from you." 
 just 
 And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. 
 just 
 She said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys." 
you know
"You know, squint." 
you know
My family finally rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide. 
well
One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind. 
 just 
I am free from judgment, and so I can do whatever I want, you know? 
you know
I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example. 
i mean
Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe, and we just didn't have enough to eat. 
 just 
You see, in the village, we were all equal. 
you see
In just three days, more than 100,000 men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality. 
 just 
Within a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door, but for the first time, I didn't just sit there. 
 just 
And it's not just Apple. 
 just 
And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are. 
 just 
Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure. 
 just 
But what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well, is that this may even apply to the brain. 
well
We know that as we get older, the blood changes as well, so these hormone-like factors change as we get older. 
well
So, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived, the chronological age. 
you see
And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation, so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. 
well
You can just say, "Well, these factors change with age," but you don't really know if they do something about aging. 
well
It's just harder to detect them, but I'll show you in a minute how we do that. 
 just 
The mice hate this and they try to escape, and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow, where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole. 
you see
It just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day. 
 just 
But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us, and it has just dried out. 
 just 
If we think about the scale of size, start with an everyday object like the tennis ball, and just go down orders of magnitude in size -- from the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme -- you eventually reach the nano-world. 
 just 
You say, "Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics." 
well
Because once you put together trillions of atoms, that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. 
 just 
Well, if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course. 
well
You see, this weirdness is very delicate; and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs. 
you see
Biology itself, if you think of molecular biology, seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry -- chemical reactions. 
well
And these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions, showing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else, and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world, then we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well. 
well
Well, one man begged to differ with this idea. 
well
In fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure, just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero, where quantum effects play a very important role. 
 just 
I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. 
 just 
This isn't speculation, by the way. 
by the way
We're happy -- well, "happy" is not the right word --  we are familiar with this. 
well
Well, it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of, is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons, from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling. 
well
Research carried out by my group -- so as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist, but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well. 
well
It's an object that behaves like a wave, so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other, but can follow multiple pathways at the same time. 
 just 
And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route; it follows multiple pathways at once, to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. 
 just 
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola, but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high. 
well
Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now? 
 just 
It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine. 
well
But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this. 
 just 
And don't just think about the UAVs. 
 just 
I mean, they are sexy -- but remember, 80 percent of the world's population lives by water, and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater -- the parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that. 
i mean
Well, why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very, very important? 
well
But you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small, and that's because robots don't do things that people do. 
you know
And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this. 
 just 
Well, let's think about that. 
well
Well, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks, and worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference. 
well
Going back to the World Trade Center, we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble, because that's what the USAR team said they wanted. 
 just 
And given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions, perhaps -- maybe even hundreds of millions -- of other [planets] that are close enough -- just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting -- to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life. 
 just 
So the GMT, if you can imagine -- if I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have, and I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here the writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin. 
 just 
 You see, every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym, naturally enough, but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation. 
you see
"I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?" 
 just 
 "So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram. 
 just 
The customer, you see, is king. 
you see
And the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation -- by the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect; the site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago, but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade. 
by the way
Jim Simons: Well the NSA -- that's the National Security Agency -- they didn't exactly come calling. 
well
JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes. 
well
JS: Well, how come? 
well
I got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on, and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story, about how we would win in Vietnam. 
well
And I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published, saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor, if anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views. 
well
 JS: I mean, I could explain it to somebody. 
i mean
JS: Well, it did, but I'll say about that work -- it did have something to do with that, but before we get to that -- that work was good mathematics. 
well
JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it -- you know, those squares. 
well
OK, well, two. That's a good number. 
well
JS: Yes. Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants: Pontryagin classes -- actually, there were Chern classes. 
well
The way it's been explained to me, what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns, it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk, So how on earth did you do this, Jim? 
 just 
I started trading and it went very well. 
well
I mean, I think it was pure luck. 
i mean
And I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models -- just the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses]. 
 just 
I look at that, and I say, "That's just a random, up-and-down walk -- maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time." 
 just 
Not necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods. 
you see
Trend-following would have been great in the '60s, and it was sort of OK in the '70s. 
 ok 
CA: You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance, which is building this culture, this group of people, who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money. 
 just 
JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true. 
well
I mean, you looked at everything, right? 
i mean
JS: Well, everything. 
well
CA: But any one anomaly might be just a random thing. 
 just 
So, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies, and see when they align? 
 just 
JS: I think in the last three or four years, hedge funds have not done especially well. 
well
JS: Well, it's not just mathematical. 
well
JS: Well, Marilyn started -- there she is up there, my beautiful wife -- she started the foundation about 20 years ago. 
well
 We started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity. 
 just 
 CA: Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically: Research into origins of life, I guess. 
i guess
JS: Well, I'll save that for a second. 
well
Well, there are two questions: One is, what is the route from geology to biology -- how did we get here? 
well
Well, more than we think. 
well
Molecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide -- things that are the building blocks -- the seeds, if you will -- of life. 
 just 
JS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works. 
well
Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another? 
 just 
When we say of somebody that he's "in it for the money," we are not just being descriptive. 
 just 
Now, I know, I know -- yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation screws people, blah blah -- that's not what I mean. 
i mean
With things, if the technology sucks, it just vanishes, right? 
 just 
And so you people -- pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe -- you people should be asking yourself a question, Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design? 
 just 
Well, we all need a reason to wake up. 
well
For me, it just took 11,000 volts. 
 just 
One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train. 
 just 
It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead. 
 just 
So I guess we're all patients. 
i guess
And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. 
well
Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center. 
well
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. 
well
But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. 
well
It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage. 
well
Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. 
well
Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic. 
well
And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky. 
 just 
In that moment, just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. 
 just 
That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not. 
 ok 
The alternative is just unacceptable. 
 just 
Well, guess what? 
well
Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins -- she's done that. 
 just 
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. 
 just 
As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. 
 just 
Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible. 
well
And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. 
well
Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just getting out of the way, aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end. 
 just 
If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it. 
well
I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety. 
you know
There were just a few thousand terrorists. 
 just 
And you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place. 
well
Well, to a group like you, the trends are apparent. 
well
But it doesn't just affect the security side. 
 just 
Now you might think, well, that's just China. 
well
But it's not just China. 
 just 
It's not just going to give them the ability to bank. 
 just 
You know, when I was watching the video again of the match, you must have felt like the fate of the world's women was on every stroke you took. 
you know
BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs -- he was the former number one player, he wasn't just some hacker, by the way. 
 just 
Title IX had just been passed the year before -- June 23, 1972. 
 just 
And that just kept sticking in my brain. 
 just 
And I thought, "You know what? 
you know
I just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word. 
 just 
That's who I truly am, just fighting for people. 
 just 
It was just ... you have to. 
 just 
And I think if you can see it you can be it, you know? 
you know
Or this poor man who kept his diploma -- he went to University of Michigan, but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever -- just would not mention it. 
 just 
So he made sure they saw he was well-educated. 
well
And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL -- which means American football for all of you out there, it's a big deal, it's very macho -- and he talked about football all the time, because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know. 
you see
It just goes on and on. 
 just 
And we catch ourselves -- I mean, I catch myself to this day. 
i mean
Even being gay I catch myself, you know, like,  a little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut, feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin. 
you know
So, I think you have to ask yourself -- I want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be. 
 just 
PM: And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that, that these examples you just used -- that many of us have the problem of being authentic. 
 just 
But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation, who have benefited from all these equal opportunities -- which may not be equal but exist everywhere -- BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky. 
 just 
Well, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is -- you know, our generation was like, "Oh, we're going to get representation." 
well
So if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented. 
you see
They just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking, and get into the solution. 
 just 
BJK: Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials. 
well
BJK: No, well, if we want to talk -- OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey. 
well
I just heard a story the other night: a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers. 
 just 
She gets a text from one of the workers, like an intern, she's just starting -- she goes, "Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's." 
 just 
She says, "Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished." 
well
PM: Now Billie, that story -- I know, but that's what scares the boomers -- I'm just telling you -- so I think it's good for us to share. 
 just 
 No, it is good for us to share, because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling, so we've got to take it both ways, you know? 
you know
And do you know that every single lawsuit that girls, at least in sports, have gone up against -- whatever institutions -- has won? 
you know
What keeps you sustaining your work, sustaining the fight for equality, extending it, always exploring new areas, trying to find new ways ... z BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one. 
well
I think to listen to these different women, to listen to different people, to listen to President Carter -- 90 years old, by the way, and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never -- I'd have to go, "Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures." 
by the way
For the last 50 years, a lot of smart, well-resourced people -- some of you, no doubt -- have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the United States. 
well
I have worked with and learned from people just like them for more than 20 years. 
 just 
And they're not just focused on money. 
 just 
Marginalized communities are full of smart, talented people, hustling and working and innovating, just like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs. 
 just 
They are full of people doing for themselves and for others, whether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor, or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill, or just watching out for the neighborhood kids from the front stoop. 
 just 
Others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough, and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path, they could make it. 
 just 
I mean, the word gender is about women. 
i mean
It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school, and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day, and we said, you know, there's an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory, but there's no courses yet. 
you know
So the black woman says to the white woman, "When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror, what do you see?" 
you see
And the black woman said, "You see, that's the problem for me. 
you see
 And somebody said, "Well what was that reaction?" 
well
And I said, "Well, when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror, I see a human being. 
well
You know, I'm a middle class white man. I have no race, no class, no gender. 
you know
I mean, if you were to say to my students, "There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States," they'd say, "Well of course you'd say that. 
well
 And that, by the way, is why I think men so often wear ties. 
by the way
Now, when men first hear about gender equality, when they first start thinking about it, they often think, many men think, well, that's right, that's fair, that's just, that's the ethical imperative. 
well
And then it was my turn to speak, and I said, "I have just one question for you guys, and it's about the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Stole My Job.' Actually, it's about one word in the title. 
 just 
And that's not just because they're all in Europe. 
 just 
They expect their partners, their spouses, their wives, to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are. 
 just 
 Well, I decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son. 
well
So I decided I would pose this riddle to them, just to see, to gauge the level of change. 
 just 
Well, 16-year-old boys, they immediately turned to me and said, "It's his mom." Right? 
well
No problem. Just like that. 
 just 
Except for my son, who said, "Well, he could have two dads." 
well
So when men share housework and childcare, their wives are happier and healthier, and men certainly want this as well. 
well
They are less likely to go to the ER but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings. 
 er 
"  Now, I will say, just to remind the men in the audience, these data were collected over a really long period of time, so I don't want listeners to say, "Hmm, OK, I think I'll do the dishes tonight." 
 just 
I recall very much the Climate March last September, and that was a huge momentum, not just in New York, but all around the world. 
 just 
I was marching with some of The Elders family, and I saw a placard a little bit away from me, but we were wedged so closely together -- because after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York -- so I couldn't quite get to that placard, I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it, because it said, "Angry Grannies!" 
 just 
And just as we've been looking back this year -- in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years -- I would like to think that they will look back, that world will look back 35 years from 2050, 35 years to 2015, and that they will say, "Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015? 
 just 
It's all about just building your resume." 
 just 
And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while, and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company. I thought, "This is fantastic. 
 just 
Well, as I'm trying to figure out what two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up, I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said, "Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age." 
well
So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work, and I read books and did case studies, 300 books altogether on purpose and career and all this, totally just self-immersion, really for the selfish reason of -- I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do, what that was for me. 
 just 
And so often their answer would be, "Well, because somebody told me I'm supposed to." 
well
The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem, I thought, what if we could create a community, a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was OK to do things differently, to take the road less traveled, where that was encouraged, and inspire people to change? 
 ok 
But as I've made these discoveries, I noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world-changers have in common, whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just, you know, the person that has the bakery down the street. 
you know
I mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study. 
i mean
Every day, every week, every month of every year I spend some time just reflecting on what went right, what went wrong, and what do I want to repeat, what can I apply more to my life. 
 just 
And even more so than that, as you see people, especially today, who inspire you, who are doing things where you say "Oh God, what Jeff is doing, I want to be like him." 
you see
And he just smiles. 
 just 
You know, before this, a passion could come and hit you in the face, or maybe in your possible line of work, you might throw it away because you don't have a way of identifying it. 
you know
And If you can't make it, just hop on one of the 20 kayaks. 
 just 
He's like, "But really, just have fun with this. Good luck." 
 just 
And I got total popsicle head, if anyone's ever swam in the Bay, and I'm trying to just thaw my face out, and I'm watching people finish. 
 just 
I just had no idea he was going to swim. 
 just 
I mean, where is he going to be in 20 years? 
i mean
You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world, just your own impossibilities, to accomplish those, and it starts with little bitty steps. 
 just 
They just came back from a month in Europe, all of them together. 
 just 
The people change everything, and this is why -- you know, you ask what was going on. 
you know
Well, for four years, I knew nobody in this space, and I didn't even know it existed, that people could do this stuff, that you could have movements like this. 
well
You don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings. 
 just 
I just read in Forbes, the US Government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off. 
 just 
It's just about doing something that matters to you, and makes an impact that only you can make. 
 just 
And as we finish up, I have just one question to ask you guys, and I think it's the only question that matters. 
 just 
Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant. 
 just 
By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live? 
i mean
Well, it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage. 
well
And I fell in love with adventure and discovery, going to explore all these different places that were just minutes from my front doorstep. 
 just 
It's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us. 
 just 
But I don't just see a tree -- I look at this and I see opportunity. 
 just 
This is a bird the size of a tennis ball -- I mean, that's crazy! 
i mean
And this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years and we're just now learning about it. 
 just 
So you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first. 
 just 
How often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable, or consider that the world may not have been made for just us? 
 just 
But the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed, starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north, and then as the rains would fall in the summer, these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography, and get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies, before meting into the cypress slews, 
 just 
Because the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for 7 million Floridians; today it also provides the agricultural fields for the year-round tomatoes and oranges for over 300 million Americans. 
 just 
But in order for you to not just understand how this system works, but to also get personally connected to it, I decided to break the story down into several different narratives. 
 just 
Well, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple snail, about the size of a ping-pong ball, an aquatic gastropod. 
well
So I built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water. 
 just 
 Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!] You can believe how excited I was when that happened. 
 oh 
But what the idea was, is that for someone who's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it, these photos, these new perspectives, will help shed a little new light on just one species that makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important. 
 just 
Because these are a unique species, they're not just apex predators. 
 just 
And now this isn't just affecting them, other animals also depend on this relationship, so they become a keystone species as well. 
well
Well, you wade into a pit of about 120 of them, then you hope that you've made the right decision. 
well
And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century -- shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 -- just as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades. 
 just 
And just as those numbers started reaching their peak, unfortunately, today, the real spoonbill story, the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this. 
 just 
Show the state that protecting wilderness not only makes ecological sense, but economic sense as well. 
well
It's just a different kind of wild. 
 just 
But the Everglades is not just a test. 
 just 
They were uniquely modern, because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch. 
well
And that's just the first few days, and just Britain. 
 just 
A similar poll taken in the United States in November 2014 had watched beheading videos, and a further 23 percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown. 
 just 
He told reporters 18 months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times, and that's just one website. 
 just 
Several still photographs were taken as well, and you can still watch the film online today and look at the photographs. 
well
The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before, but it's not just about the camera. 
 just 
This is a well-recognized phenomenon. 
well
I was working on the cranial collections, and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing, and all the while these vast -- I mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States -- were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality. 
 just 
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. 
well
But you can imagine that I was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials, despite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men --  who happen to have different reproductive systems. 
 just 
"No Signs of Struggle" Growing small requires enormity of will: just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out, watching it stoop; stare at you while you try not to look. 
 just 
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms -- glow bioluminescent, and people as well; we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves. 
well
Place your foot just so, mind how you turn: too swift a swivel can bring you down. 
 just 
The density of black starts to blur umber. 
 um
So I guess I was the lucky one. 
i guess
And do you know that at the time I was completing my education, I didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country. 
you know
And you know, in the refugee camp, when I went day-to-day to do a survey, I found things you never could imagine. 
you know
And you know, as a leader, what do you do? 
you know
You're scared. You know it's dangerous. 
you know
You know your life is on the line. 
you know
And, of course, by that time, you know how I dress -- I dress from head to toe in a black hijab. 
you know
Don't you know that school is banned for girls? 
you know
And you know, I just looked at them, and I said, "What school? Where is the school?" 
you know
And you know, Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book, the woman, they can be a good wife, and they can obey their husband." 
you know
 And I tell you one thing: that's the way you work with those people, and you know --  So by that time, they started speaking Pashto. 
you know
And you know, this time, I offered them tea again, and they took a sip and they left. 
you know
So I just hold myself on the side of the car. 
 just 
You know what they said to me? 
you know
  "And you know, how about us? 
you know
The only thing we can do, what we know, from the time we're born, we just hold the gun and kill. 
 just 
And you know what that means. 
you know
And when, two days later, I went the same route, and do you know, they were not in here, they were a little back further, the same young men, standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car. 
you know
I just want to share this with you. 
 just 
I was aware of everything, just like any normal person. 
 just 
Well, nothing pleasant. 
well
I just never knew when. 
 just 
While those I had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair. 
 just 
Still, things were going well. 
well
Our words, however we communicate them, are just as powerful. 
 just 
As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions, we're making that choice on behalf of others as well. 
well
So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world, and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure, where there are people that are well-insured and so on, then that impact can be disruptive. 
well
But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure, or where people are not well-insured, or they're not having good support networks, then that same climate change impact could be devastating. 
well
And all the way through, during all of these meetings and many others as well, emissions have continued to rise. 
well
Now, let's just pause for a moment and think about this four-degree global average temperature. 
 just 
And the problem with these extremes, and not just the temperature extremes, but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts, is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events. 
 just 
So if we go back, also thinking about four degrees, it's not just the direct impacts, but also some indirect impacts. 
 just 
But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems, on food systems, aviation and also shipping, just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change. 
 just 
And that's important, because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology to sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049, just in the nick of time to sort things out. 
 just 
And that's because with all the will in the world, that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system is just simply not going to happen in time. 
 just 
Another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well-being and equity. 
well
Let me just put that into context. 
 just 
So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011 where we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change, economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations. 
 just 
This is not about just incremental change. 
 just 
Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees. 
 just 
But I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame. 
 just 
And I responded to him, "Well, from my point of view that makes sense. 
well
And much to his surprise, I said, "Well actually, we do." 
well
So Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is, wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better. 
you know
But moreover, if you just block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant. 
 just 
And here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage. 
you see
And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be. 
you see
And now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage. 
you see
So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be. 
you see
And I'm just going to point a few out to you: Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis. 
 just 
Or is it really just about aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain? 
 just 
ST: So for the moment, we can't really say if it's just the running itself, but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production -- or moving the blood flow to the brain, should be beneficial. 
 just 
You know, if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body, every chemical reaction that your body is capable of, most people think that that number is on the order of a million. 
you know
You know, if you think about human physiology as a vast global telephone network with interacting nodes and interacting pieces, then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge, the outer edge, of that network. 
you know
What's nice about this scheme, this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards, is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way. 
well
You know, we don't think of cancer as altering the environment. 
you know
Well, the second perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments. 
well
 And so Dan suggested to me, "You know, maybe it isn't a mechanical problem. 
you know
Number one, there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell -- a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton, bone, cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton, just like there's a stem cell in blood, just like there's a stem cell in the nervous system. 
 just 
The white stuff is bone, and these red columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell -- columns of cartilage, columns of bone coming out of a single cell. 
you see
They live just underneath the surface of the bone, underneath cartilage. 
 just 
You know, in biology, it's location, location, location. 
you know
You know, we know that exercise remodels bone, but come on, none of us is going to exercise. 
you know
You know, in every culture, shamans have been using environments as medicines. 
you know
You know, when an architect builds a model, he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature. 
you know
You know, there's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact on the treatment of illness is because we don't have powerful-enough drugs, and that's partly true. 
you know
But of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being, as it were. 
 just 
Well, in this, there's personalization all the way. 
well
 I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too long There's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead But I was just thinking, merely thinking I've got loads of pictures, I've got the one of you in that dancing dress But man I feel silly in that dim light Just after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights, I am sinking, 
 just 
merely sinking I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe I'm a singer without a song If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger and I ... I was just thinking, merely thinking that this boat is sinking I'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids I'm tired of calling you and missing you and dreaming I slept with you Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you 
 just 
inside this weary head I just want us to love just instead But I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinking I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe and time is running me still If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger I ... I was just thinking I ... I was just thinking that I'm tired of calling you once a week thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you 
 just 
In my lab, we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here. 
you see
And then it can assemble all these features into a map, like you see behind me. 
you see
And in a minute you'll see it enter our lab, which is recognizable by the clutter that you see. 
you see
That joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy, Giuseppe can kill it. 
 just 
 In addition to building these small robots, we also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here. 
you see
And in this next video, just like you see this bird, an eagle, gracefully coordinating its wings, its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water, our robot can go fishing, too. 
you see
So just like these honeybees, we build small robots. 
 just 
It's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors. 
 just 
And they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination that you see in natural swarms, in nature. 
you see
As you well know, one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished. 
well
Well, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community. 
well
So just like personalized medicine, while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually, what we'd like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs -- the inputs in this case being water, fertilizer and pesticide. 
 just 
So if you know this leaf area index, you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant, which again tells you how healthy each plant is. 
you know
And in this particular case, you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops. 
well
This is easily discernible from imagery, not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery. 
 just 
Well, according to the governments of the world, yes we can. 
well
Well, I'm here today because we've run the numbers, and the answer, shockingly, is that maybe we actually can. 
well
But please, I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment. 
 just 
Well, no, we didn't. 
well
Well, a lot of it was because of economic growth. 
well
Well, to answer that question, we need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals and figure out how far we have to travel. 
well
But that ain't easy, because the Global Goals aren't just ambitious, they're also pretty complicated. 
 just 
Now, the Global Goals are certainly ambitious, but they're not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years. 
 just 
So having looked at the numbers, my estimate is that a score of 75 would not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being, it would also count as hitting the Global Goals target. 
well
Well, the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this, because as you might have noticed, there are no economic indicators in there; there's no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model. 
well
Well, the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture, which forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth over the next 15 years, which means that in 2030, if they're right, per capita GDP will be about $23,000. 
well
Well, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers, and they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year, social progress is going to increase from 61 to 62.4. 
well
 Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase. 
 just 
Well, I think there are two things. 
well
And also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits. 
well
We're not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer. 
 just 
Our choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people, then we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect. 
well
Well, let's look at some numbers. 
well
So let's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress -- the Russia, China, Indias -- just up to the average. 
 just 
Well, that takes us to 65. 
well
So let's get a little bit more optimistic and say, what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well-being? 
well
Well then, we get to 67. 
well
What if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica in prioritizing human well-being, using its wealth for the well-being of its citizens? 
well
Well then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals. 
well
Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there, if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy and leaves the rest behind. 
 just 
Michael, just one question: the Millennium Development Goals established 15 years ago, they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries. 
 just 
Michael Green: This is a really important point; it's a big shift in priorities -- it's no longer about poor countries and just poverty. 
 just 
Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory, to animal studies, to then clinical trials on humans, finally to go through a regulatory approval process, to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you? 
you know
Well, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory, they're male cells, and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals, and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men. 
well
But just this past year, the Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only, because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men, causing them to wake up in the morning with more of the active drug in their system. 
 just 
Since that time, an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way. 
 just 
You know, we have this saying in medicine: children are not just little adults. 
you know
Women are not just men with boobs and tubes. 
 just 
And the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack, well, they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men, and so aren't as good at determining that in women. 
well
We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack, but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman, it's actually harmful? 
you know
Because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders. 
 just 
We now know just enough to know that we weren't doing it right. 
 just 
This is not just about improving medical care for women. 
 just 
Now, in fairness, if you've spent any time at all in Washington, DC, you know this is really a radical concept for the government. 
you know
But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes. 
well
Now, if you think that characterization is too strong, just look at some of the government's own documents. 
 just 
This story is not just about prisoners. 
 just 
In some of these cases, they have great representation that I mentioned, but there's just not a public awareness of what's happening. 
 just 
And I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have, that allows these types of things to happen, as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it. 
 just 
And like I said, I've been there myself, as well. 
well
And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people, and the police made this theory as well. 
well
Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France, people would just know. 
 just 
But if you just fled the war in Syria, and your family, if you have any family left, don't necessarily know where you are, and you're staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day. 
 just 
Well, if you disappear one day, nobody will notice. 
well
And to me, and probably a lot of you, a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful, whether that be spending more time with your family and friends, travel to an exotic place, or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers. 
 just 
It means being able to send your children to school, go to university, or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love. 
 just 
And I have no trouble imagining as a second-grade citizen, living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid, racist name like "The Jungle," most of us would be willing to do just about anything. 
 just 
As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was, we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted, just travel wherever you need to go, do whatever you need to do, just get this done. 
 just 
The story, by the way, has been translated and published across several European countries, and certainly will continue to do. 
by the way
The CRISPR technology has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys, other organisms as well. 
well
Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome, and they're otherwise completely normal. 
 just 
And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility, to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough. 
well
It's interesting that as I talk to people, my scientific colleagues as well as others, there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this. 
well
BG: Now, colleagues of yours, like George Church, for example, at Harvard, they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety. 
 just 
JD: Well, I think with any new technology, especially something like this, there are going to be a variety of viewpoints, and I think that's perfectly understandable. 
well
JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory. 
well
And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way, just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology. 
 just 
We're moving from a time of static information, held in books and libraries and bus stops, through a period of digital information, towards a period of fluid information, where your children will expect to be able to access anything, anywhere at any time, from quantum physics to medieval viticulture, from gender theory to tomorrow's weather, just like switching on a lightbulb -- Imagine that. 
 just 
The parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read, as well as family-safe app stores. 
well
I mean, scientifically. 
i mean
These principles should underpin how we design for the future, not just for the Internet. 
 just 
So the boat sped away in anger, and a half an hour later, came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat, just below where she and Bassem were sitting. 
 just 
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned, and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter. 
 just 
A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child -- a little boy, just four years old. 
 just 
When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned, she said to the sobbing child, "She just went away to find you water and food." 
 just 
"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother? 
you know
My sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?" 
you know
And Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too. 
well
She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well, and I believe she will succeed. 
well
Well, that is largely Europe's choice. 
well
When you enter a quartzite cave, you have to completely forget what you know about caves -- classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world. 
you know
BG: I want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show, and it's just representative of the other photos -- Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah? 
 just 
But when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there, and yet they look incredibly well-exposed. 
well
This is big scale. OK --  But there's one weird side effect. 
 ok 
So we launched Crisis Text Line, very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market. 
 just 
We just get facts. 
 just 
As a mom that one just -- The next message comes a month later. 
 just 
"I just got out of the hospital. 
 just 
 How do you know that person's any good? 
you know
You know, sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction -- they're right there in one person's life. 
you know
None of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference. 
well
And just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan. 
 just 
These are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem. 
 just 
One of the policemen says to me, "Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave." 
 just 
So, I've spent time living with families like Ella's because I want to know: what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren't working? 
 just 
Well, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept. 
well
Instead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart, exactly where they are. 
 just 
So many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile. 
well
And so the first person who comes in says, "Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit and I will back out very slowly, and if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor." 
well
And then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says, "Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do." 
well
So, they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers, who said -- well, they weren't going to talk in jargon. 
well
Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards. 
well
But today, she's completed an IT training course, she has her first paid job, her children are back in school, and the neighbors, who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them, are fine. 
 just 
So what do I mean by relationships? 
i mean
And the impact of Beveridge on the way the modern state sees social issues just can't be underestimated. 
 just 
I went shopping, I played bingo, but mainly I was just observing and listening. 
 just 
They've called because their pets are unwell, their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone, or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there. 
well
And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the 1970s, when this kind of scale just wasn't possible, neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide. 
 just 
And, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models, but it looks like, with our first 1,000 members, we outperformed existing services by a factor of three, at a fraction of the cost. 
well
 First, tell me just a detail: the name of the hotel is not a random name. 
 just 
BG: That's just to add the detail to your talk. 
 just 
But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos very recently, you're just back a couple of days ago, in Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months. 
 just 
What did you see there and what did you do there? 
you see
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey, and during our stay, many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies, and after landing, they were left completely on their own. 
well
BG: And allow them to talk as well. 
well
I guess the big question here is, am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation, or am I just documenting their extinction? 
 just 
Well, first, we need data. 
well
Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country, where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats, including once again cattle ranching, large sugarcane and soybean plantations, poaching, roadkill, just to name a few. 
 just 
We really do, and you know what? 
you know
And I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado, so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs. 
 just 
For now, this is just a crazy idea. 
 just 
And you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs but all the other beautiful species, now and in the future. 
you know
There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light. 
 just 
So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. 
well
So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. 
well
Now, as a man of the humanities, albeit a digital humanities man, that just makes my skin curl, even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google. 
 just 
But let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget. 
 just 
But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like, "Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?" 
 just 
So, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard to get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge -- as food for thought. 
 just 
It works really well, as you can see. 
well
It's just her in the picture, not even the President. 
 just 
And he prepared all three steps equally well. 
well
Of course, there are gay people in Asia, just as there are gay people in every part of the world. 
 just 
But is the idea of living an "out" life, in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together" kind of way just a Western idea? 
 just 
They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons why they escaped to the US. 
 just 
LD: There was just one problem. 
 just 
 We didn't even know where to find the Supergays, so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way. 
 just 
I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace. 
 just 
Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello", just so that people could hear my feminine voice. 
 just 
This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am. 
 just 
And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well. 
well
And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live. 
 just 
And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail. 
 just 
Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much --  Now we have sneaker addictions. 
 just 
So I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. 
 just 
And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs. 
 just 
The sneaker market is just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using supply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit. 
 just 
So it's really just supply. 
 just 
That's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers. 
 just 
You know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year? 
you know
What if the way to buy a share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places online and off, including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock? 
 just 
And what if it wasn't just sneakers, but any similar product, like watches and handbags and women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item and any markdown item? 
 just 
Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see where this is going. 
well
Let's start with a question: Does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat? 
 just 
Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us, easy to see, right, what's going on in that fuzzy little head. 
well
Well, it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow, it will develop anxiety. 
well
 Octopuses use tools, as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces. 
well
This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about. 
 just 
If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain, what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain. 
you see
 But, uh oh, there's a dolphin, a bigger brain with more convolutions. 
 uh 
OK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains, but what does that have to say about minds? 
well
We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains, listening to the howls of the same dangers, they became who they are and we became who we are. 
 just 
Not only do elephants know that there are humans, they know that there are different kinds of humans, and that some are OK and some are dangerous. 
 ok 
If you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything, you are conscious, and they are conscious. 
you see
Some people say well, there are certain things that make humans humans, and one of those things is empathy. 
well
If your companions suddenly startle and fly away, it does not work very well for you to say, "Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left." 
well
Then there's something that I call sympathy, a little more removed: "I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away. 
 just 
Now, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species. 
well
That's just predation, and humans are predators. 
 just 
But we don't treat our own kind too well either. 
well
Well, I think that's silly, because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling, because their brains are basically the same as ours. 
well
The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well. 
well
And then, when they wandered just outside the border, two of their adults were killed, including the mother, which we sometimes call the alpha female. 
 just 
This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale. 
 just 
He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions. 
 just 
How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped? 
 just 
These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all. 
 just 
We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel, and, as happens in war, the fighting began to approach outside our windows. 
 just 
Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened." 
 just 
Well, it's an encounter with death. 
well
And they experience horrible anxiety attacks -- panic attacks, not just minor fears. 
 just 
I have seen men cry -- just like children -- from seeing the same image. 
 just 
They say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries. 
you see
After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner -- I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide. 
well
We're just not ready to listen. 
 just 
One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq -- well, not "died," let me re-phrase that -- one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD. 
well
So you see, this relates to everything, not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars -- you can read about it, the evidence is there. 
you see
And the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away." 
well
So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people. 
you see
So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model, just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant. 
 just 
"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out," a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week, and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter, but actually as an urban actor, as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city. 
you see
And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. 
you see
So you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity. 
you see
What if I could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind? 
 just 
Until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling, she was just crying. 
 just 
Now, when you're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds, and you see the injured around you, it's an incredibly scary and real feeling. 
you see
You know, maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries. 
you know
And "Hunger in LA," well, it's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future. 
well
And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend. 
you see
 I mean -- me, it makes sense, right? But you know, this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research. 
you know
It was created by these early artists in Europe, that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is. 
 just 
The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites, usually the ones with the very nice animals, there was also a large number of them where it was very vague -- there wasn't a lot of description or detail. 
well
If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world. 
well
So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters. Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks, maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them. 
well
That dive you just watched is a journey -- a journey between two breaths. 
 just 
But it's also, and above all, an inner journey, where a number of things happen, physiologically as well as mentally. 
well
The diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in, and mentally, there is something going on as well. 
well
He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon, just like in the movie. 
 just 
I get this extraordinary feeling of well-being. 
well
Do you know what it is? 
you know
Looking at this picture, I feel very humble -- just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom -- because I'm nothing, I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space. 
 just 
They were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago, and now, they've opened up again. 
 just 
I can finally celebrate what has just happened. 
 just 
So, the journey I've just described to you is a more extreme version of free diving. 
 just 
Luckily, it's far from just that. For the past few years, I've been trying to show another side of free diving, because the media mainly talks about competitions and records. 
 just 
But free diving is more than just that. 
 just 
Being able to free dive lets you, just for a moment, relax your mind. 
 just 
Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country. 
 just 
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care. 
well
And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people, "You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?" 
you know
CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there. 
 just 
AT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades. 
well
AT: Well, I think it's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land, because much of the land is low. 
well
And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment. 
well
Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum. 
well
AT: Well, we're on the equator, and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator, it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones. 
well
And I've just come back from my own constituency, and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades, they've been totally destroyed. 
 just 
It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells, and so they can be magnified, but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern, which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level. 
well
AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year. 
well
AT: Well, we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community, we are preparing, we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe. 
well
CA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past, and I think just this week, just yesterday or the day before yesterday, you visited these people. 
well
CA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity, the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost. 
 just 
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry, and you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused. 
you know
AT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day, and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world. 
well
AT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return, because what we are getting from license fees is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops. 
well
I mean, as you think about their future, what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world? 
i mean
AT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us, it's about the future of these children. 
well
I just want to thank you, I'm sure, on behalf of all of us, for your extraordinary leadership and for being here. 
 just 
You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --  which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental. 
 just 
When things don't turn out well, Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?" 
well
She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past. 
well
And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening, and it was all public, and they were with their wives. 
 just 
In the theater, the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup. 
 just 
Which is very important, the performance is -- you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things. 
you know
And you know, I've been doing performances since the last 40 years. 
you know
You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets, I exchange into love and trust. 
you know
It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces, this was before China was open in '87. 
you know
I want to show you the one who really changed my life, and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made. 
 just 
This performance -- when I said to the curator, "I'm just going to sit at the chair, and there will be an empty chair at the front, and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want." 
 just 
The curator said to me, "That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York, this chair will be empty, nobody has time to sit in front of you." 
you know
It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter. 
 just 
 And you know, sleeping is very important. 
you know
So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time, and then after this you just, you know, go back, you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate. 
you know
Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil, then it's going to be in Australia, then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere. 
 just 
 You know, if you count rice you can make life, too. 
you know
You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry, being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting. 
you know
Or having the sound-isolated situation -- that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything, and you're just there together without sound, with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence. 
 just 
You do things in life -- it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way. 
 just 
And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes. 
 just 
Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago, I made an alarming discovery. 
well
So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French and published in the UK each year, most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland. 
well
For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance. 
 just 
And not just here. 
 just 
Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted. 
 oh 
Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy? 
you know
 CA: Oh ... hi. 
 oh 
Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video. 
 just 
I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images, which look nothing like my life, that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that I hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby's food source is attached to your body. 
 just 
I'm just going to show you two of them. 
 just 
Did you know, and this will ruin your day, that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours? 
you know
You know, that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing, can sound correct. 
you know
Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave, most women can't afford to take much of it at all. 
 just 
We just couldn't manage any longer. 
 just 
Of course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications. 
 just 
I thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this." 
 just 
One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers have 12 or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year, so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases. 
well
This is a coral that I studied during my PhD -- I got to know it quite well. 
well
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old. 
 just 
And here you see one embryo dividing, alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize and will blow up. 
you see
We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility. 
 just 
In fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections, in the liminal space, where by liminal I mean the space in-between. 
i mean
I had no idea that at that time, according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline, and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field did so just one year before my birth. 
 just 
I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart. 
 just 
Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's departure from our lives. 
 just 
Beyond that, though, it underscores that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face. 
 just 
Jessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products, like soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them, said it this way: "A major part of invention isn't just creating things, it's understanding people and understanding the systems that make this world." 
 just 
It just printed the pieces overnight. 
 just 
The next morning, I just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now. 
 just 
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell -- I could just design them and print them directly from home. 
 just 
I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself. 
 just 
I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics. 
 just 
And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric. 
 just 
So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7. 
 just 
And this is actually a really slow process, but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago, so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours, or even minutes. 
 just 
You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music -- digital music -- directly to your phone. 
 just 
And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is. 
 just 
And as I sort of looked into that, from a very personal point of view as a fisherman, I started to kind of figure out, well, what was the rest of the world thinking about it? 
well
Well, when I looked into it, I realized that people didn't look at it as their team. 
well
If you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago, you'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves, you'll see all kinds of different creatures. 
you know
But if you telescope to the age of -- you know, 2,000 years ago, you'll see these four mammals: pigs, cows, sheep and goats. 
you know
Well ... 
well
And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity, from the end of World War II to the present time. 
you see
Well, that's only half the story. 
well
Well, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests. 
well
These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed. 
well
Well, we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture. 
well
I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight --  If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi, I feel that we could have an infinitely better world. 
 just 
But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers, and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says, "You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut, cause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams." 
you know
Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win. 
well
I mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids? 
i mean
Well, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them? 
well
They filter the water just like mussels do. 
 just 
So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with. 
i guess
Well, I'm an ocean chemist. 
well
If you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea, you know it gets colder as you go down, and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense. 
you know
And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long. 
 just 
And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased. 
you see
We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year. 
 just 
And we go down, and these are the kinds of things you see. 
you see
This is a beautiful holothurian as well. 
well
This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks. 
 just 
You can see the density of the surface water It's just one year of data, but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is. 
 just 
It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you. 
 just 
It's just a beautiful place. 
 just 
So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean, just think -- there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before, and there are beautiful corals. 
 just 
Well, it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year. 
well
How that actually works is that right now we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue. 
you see
And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces, essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it. 
 just 
Take a look at that from the side as well, you see a very efficient system. 
well
But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions. 
 just 
So why don't you give them a little history -- just a tickle -- a bit of history of where it comes from. 
 just 
Well, we from St. Louis. 
well
But now, you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now, and they want to humiliate their father, which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you, pay all your tuition,  especially when you have 50 million people that just go around and call you "the loser." 
 just 
Well, I'm taking that to heart. 
well
You know, in church, we'll look at each other like,   and we'll text the beat to each other. 
you know
 Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what? 
you know
NP: Why don't we give them a little peek, just a tiny bit of our jam session? 
 just 
So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death. 
 just 
They were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years. 
well
And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost, and it looks like there's serious money to be made. 
you know
So just to explain to you kind of how this works: If I want to build something in the UK, like a cemetery for example, then I have to apply for planning permission first. 
 just 
So if I want to build a new office building for a client or if I want to extend my home or, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office, I have to do a load of drawings, and I submit them to the council for permission. 
you know
But what if I've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people, like five or six? 
 just 
Well, then -- actually, I don't need permission from anyone! 
well
But I mean, like -- really, who does this? Right? 
i mean
Well, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate, then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it, and you'll bury your family there. 
well
So, the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead -- you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio. 
 just 
And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make, they also warn that it might cause the value of your house to drop by 20 percent. 
 just 
And the reasons that people give ... you know, they think that their death is far off or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it. 
you know
And you know, to a certain extent, there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us. 
you know
Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking about female friendship a lot, and by the way, these two women, I'm very honored to say, have been my friends for a very long time, too. 
by the way
We have a very limited -- LT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me. 
 just 
  JF: You know, I was thinking this morning, I don't even know what I would do without my women friends. 
you know
I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am." 
i mean
I don't know about you. But anyway --  You know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter, they make me braver. 
you know
You know? I mean, it's nice -- LT: Thank you. 
you know
 JF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know -- it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you're getting toward the end. 
you know
 LT: Well, you are and you have. 
well
PM: Well, as we grow older, and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys, what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive? 
well
LT: Well you have to use a lot of -- JF: She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that. 
well
LT: Oh ... JF: No? 
 oh 
I read a lot so, as Lily knows all too well, my books that I like, I send to my friends. 
well
 JF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing. 
well
LT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" ... 
well
JF: Oh -- LT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much, we found we had so much in common and we're so different. 
 oh 
 If you know what I mean. 
you know
So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister, who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act, they're a spiritual act. 
 just 
I just see deeply into your soul. 
 just 
JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends. 
well
You know, we go deep. And -- I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends. 
you know
LT: And you know one of you is going to go soon. 
you know
 PM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about? 
well
I mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?" 
i mean
 JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that of our women friends, and men don't. 
i mean
You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face, whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side. 
you know
LT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions, they want to bury deeper feelings. 
i mean
I mean, that's the general, conventional thought. 
i mean
I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior. 
 just 
I meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to --  JF: You know something, though, that I find very interesting -- and again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently -- is that men are born every bit as relational as women are. 
you know
It's not that we're better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove. 
 just 
LT: And, well -- JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote. 
well
JF: I know you know who she is, but I think it's a --  No, but it's a great quote, I think. 
you know
We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove. 
 just 
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject. 
well
It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need. 
 just 
JF: Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world, especially older women. 
well
You know, that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet, and that's not true. 
you know
There are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine. 
 just 
That we will be -- there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being, and it's women that are going to lead the way. 
well
LT: No, exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was. 
 just 
It's like, you know, men do need women now. 
you know
 And gender equality, it's like a tide, it would lift all boats, not just women. 
 just 
Gardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses. 
 just 
And it's really hard to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile. 
 just 
And what do you see here? 
you see
Because for me, this is just the beginning of the mission. 
 just 
Well, that is kind of true, but the Higgs boson is particularly special. 
well
In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on, not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value, a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position. 
 just 
Well, even that one won't do here. 
well
In fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics, and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity. 
 just 
But others actually turned this on its head and said, well, maybe this apparent failure is string theory's greatest triumph. 
well
We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right. 
 just 
I just mentioned, introducing you, that we live in a short-term world. 
 just 
Harry Cliff: I was very lucky that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in 2008, just as we were switching on, and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades, their entire careers on one machine. 
 just 
So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in 1976, and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you're going to need to be able to build it. 
you know
BG: China just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build a supercollider twice the size of the LHC. 
 just 
But I mean, seriously, it's great news. 
i mean
AG: Well, I think, basically, what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group. 
well
I mean, they look at their own country and they don't see much hope to go back home, because there is no political solution, so there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 
i mean
We just had research with the World Bank, and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon live below the national poverty lines. 
 just 
AG: Well, unprepared because divided, and when you are divided, you don't want to recognize the reality. 
well
I mean, if you look at the relocation program that was approved by the Commission, always too little too late, or by the Council, too little too late -- BG: It's already breaking down. 
i mean
AG: Well, that is a question that has no answer, because refugees have the right to be protected. 
well
The Prime Minister of -- AG: But, if I may, on these: I mean, what does a European see at home in a village where there are no migrants? 
i mean
But, unfortunately, we have a lot of people scared, just because Europe was not able to do the job properly. 
 just 
AG: Well, 86 percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world. 
well
They have millions of refugees there, and to be honest, they are pillars of stability in the region, with all the difficulties they face, and the first line of defense of our collective security. 
to be honest
AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump. 
well
And it's just telling them, "You are right, we are against you." 
 just 
AG: In the sense that, I mean, for many people the first reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is: close all borders -- not understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown. 
i mean
We have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq, so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in. 
 just 
If you look back at 2005, when you entered that office for the first time, what do you see? 
you see
AG: Well, look: In 2005, we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity, because conflicts had ended. 
well
AG: Well, I don't think I would write any message. 
well
You know, one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver, always telling the new one what to do. 
you know
And conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization, but it goes the other way as well. 
well
And it goes the other way as well, with recruitment. 
well
And it's not just individuals -- it's organizations, corporations even. 
 just 
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting." 
 just 
 To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. 
 just 
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know, it's about time." 
you know
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. 
well
It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. 
well
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. 
 just 
Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. 
 just 
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. 
 just 
So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. 
well
Well, we're human. 
well
Well, the possibilities are practically endless. 
well
In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern. 
 just 
In just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people, and over 100,000 people confirmed attendance. 
 just 
I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt. 
 just 
But of course, this wasn't just about me. 
 just 
It's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars. 
 just 
I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized Egyptian society, but this is not just about Egypt. 
 just 
Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations, rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time? 
 just 
If I could track how many people are changing their minds, I'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that, rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and "liking" because I just confirmed their biases. 
 just 
And in just a few hours, Jarrett would walk out on the same stage, he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music, he would begin to play. 
 just 
But right now, Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question, and it wasn't going well. 
well
The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small. 
 just 
What do I mean by that? 
i mean
What I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant, you're having a conversation, there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant, you want to filter them out, you want to focus on what's important to you. 
i mean
Well, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step. 
well
But you know what would make it a better way? 
you know
In some cases these were four friends, they all knew each other well. 
well
 The three friends and the stranger, even though the stranger didn't have any extra information, even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness, the three friends and the stranger, they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer. 
 just 
But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job, but how they felt about it. 
 just 
Well, he makes a mess. 
well
The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally, they were just a list -- list on the recording studio wall. 
 just 
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. 
 just 
It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth. 
 just 
And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past, it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells. 
well
Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for, it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water. 
well
And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors, we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water. 
 just 
You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city, they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year. 
 just 
And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought, like California's currently experiencing, you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem. 
 just 
Well, the answer is you don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit. 
well
Well, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year I was telling you about. 
well
But just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive, doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere. 
 just 
I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this. 
 just 
He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well." 
well
 And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could? 
 just 
But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape! 
 just 
And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher. 
you see
 And if you know anything about black preachers, we'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes. 
you know
I've been a police officer for a very long time, and I mean I predated technology. 
i mean
I predate War on Our Fellow Man -- I mean, War on Drugs. 
i mean
Even though we in law enforcement say, "You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this." 
you know
You know what? 
you know
And yet all the while, still, we continue in the same vein, the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted. 
 just 
I was just so tired. 
 just 
National rating at that time, national rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating], was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation, or just zip codes across the nation. 
 just 
And I said, you know what? We gotta do something different. 
you know
No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good! 
 just 
 You know, it's kinda weak. 
you know
And so, as I try to hurry and get through this, I need to say this: it's not just law enforcement, though. 
 just 
You know who came? It was the elders. 
you know
You see, after three years of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district, three years in, after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this -- it's a little secret -- I knew this: it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy. 
you see
I believe, as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say, "We're in this together," because it's not just an intersection: once we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals, and this city will become great again. 
 just 
Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths. 
well
I mean, imagine yourself here in this room, if you were suddenly plunged into blackness, with your only job to find the exit, sometimes swimming through these large spaces, and at other times crawling beneath the seats, following a thin guideline, just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath. 
 just 
Well, that's my workplace. 
well
The red that you see in this photograph is actually dust from the Sahara Desert. 
you see
Our water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans, but it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together. 
 just 
However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. 
well
And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. 
well
Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. 
well
You know -- research. 
you know
But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. 
 just 
And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well. 
well
Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut. 
 just 
 So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. 
 just 
But basically, it's the game we just played. 
 just 
Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence. 
well
Well, yes, absolutely it can. 
well
If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story. 
 ok 
So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. 
 just 
The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day. 
 just 
It's just raw material. 
 just 
But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time. 
 just 
Well, the current world population is around 7 billion. 
well
They send down very deep roots, mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times, keeping themselves hydrated. 
 just 
The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again. 
 just 
They just don't need them. 
 just 
We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off, in response to drying. 
 just 
They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions. 
 just 
I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach. 
 just 
And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start. 
 just 
Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damaging and can cause crop death. 
well
All modern crops, therefore, have these genes in their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on. 
 just 
And just a final thought. 
 just 
And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts. 
 just 
I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real. 
i mean
And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. 
 just 
And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. 
 just 
And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. 
 just 
We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this. 
 just 
It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely. 
 just 
But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them. 
you see
And in total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish. 
 just 
The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures. 
 just 
In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers. 
well
They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. 
well
And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator. 
well
And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. 
well
Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark. 
i mean
There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters -- almost nothing, it's just darkness. 
 just 
The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle. 
you know
You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. 
 just 
It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better. 
 just 
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. 
well
And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel. 
i mean
Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life. 
 just 
The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global. 
well
But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well. 
well
He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures -- decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums. 
well
There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color. 
 just 
The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next. 
you see
Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, "It is good." 
 just 
And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame. 
you see
They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles -- they're just like athletes. 
 just 
It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures. 
 just 
Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did. 
 just 
I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged. 
 just 
"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and ... 
well
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes." 
you know
And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene. 
 just 
These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none. 
 just 
Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years. 
well
So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents. 
 just 
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough," seemed all the more reason to take on this fight. 
 just 
I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, but not this good. 
i mean
We just could not comprehend how this had happened. 
 just 
So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer -- he was a scientist. 
 just 
He was not just a scientist -- he had a PhD in molecular biology. 
 just 
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, "Well, I don't know. 
well
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that. 
well
I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore. 
 just 
It all just happened really, really, really fast. 
 just 
And kids, you know what? 
you know
They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. 
 just 
And the boy, he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application. 
you see
IW: We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags. 
 just 
we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again. 
well
And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports. 
 just 
She started with just one Roots &amp; Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world. 
 just 
It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. 
well
Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach. 
well
We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas -- just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us. 
 just 
The first component is just the body, to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals. 
 just 
But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem. 
 just 
You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion. 
 just 
The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well. 
well
Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations. 
 just 
It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans. 
you see
Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. 
 just 
So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot. 
you see
If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better. 
you see
But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this. 
you see
So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot. 
you see
And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other. 
 just 
It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles. 
 just 
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot. 
you see
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break. 
you see
It will just jump, in fact. 
 just 
And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion. 
 just 
But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over. 
 just 
But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right. 
 just 
AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you. 
 just 
Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed. 
well
Well, after a while, our creative brains say, "You know what? 
well
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. 
 just 
You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?" 
you know
Same process, just a different trigger. 
 just 
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience? 
 just 
Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. 
 just 
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do." 
 just 
Well here's an example from one of our smokers. 
well
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. 
 just 
We just can't help ourselves. 
 just 
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place. 
 just 
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. 
 just 
In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. 
 just 
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. 
 just 
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... 
 just 
However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated. 
 just 
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. 
 just 
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism. 
 just 
Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. 
 just 
But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. 
 just 
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion. 
well
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. 
well
Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D. 
 just 
And so they have to come to the table as well. 
well
WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half. 
 just 
A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat. 
 just 
We just don't have enough feed or water. 
 just 
You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less. 
 just 
Well, that's because fish, first of all, float. 
well
There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients. 
 just 
How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was. 
 just 
Once you know, you know. 
you know
Insects are the -- well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. 
well
This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale. 
 just 
And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe -- this is for all of us. 
 just 
Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money. 
 just 
The day will come where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less. 
well
In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African? 
 just 
Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, "Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself." 
well
Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice. 
well
And it's not just the view of social scientists. 
 just 
Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them? 
 just 
Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut. 
well
It's just a distraction. 
 just 
Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being. 
well
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race. 
 just 
For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people. 
 just 
He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine." 
well
It's a well-known function called "correcting for race." 
well
You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference. 
you see
The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine. 
 just 
Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race? 
 just 
One fish is just one fish in the sea. 
 just 
So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good. 
well
Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so. 
well
But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right? 
 just 
They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business, like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served, not just quarterly results; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty, retention and productivity. 
 just 
Now, sustainable investing, the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret, and it's not just for the elite. 
 just 
It is not just about private equity for billionaires. 
 just 
It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn. 
 just 
Secondly, the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads. 
 just 
We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking, that you get less sweet porridge. 
 just 
You know. Love is great, too. 
you know
They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember, first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism. 
 just 
I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days. 
 just 
And if these politicians ever get their way, in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston, Texas, or Ottawa, well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either. 
well
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table, I can't help but wonder, you know, just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right? 
you know
If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone, then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places. 
 just 
We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, which I do not. 
 just 
And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good. 
i mean
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes. 
 just 
We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute. 
 just 
So let's just do it. 
 just 
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, or it's too expensive, or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality, or your masculinity, or your religious beliefs, then let me just appeal 
 just 
Your physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression. 
you know
Well, wait a minute. 
well
Well, it's very hard to do that. 
well
I said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately, and we don't have a great understanding. 
you know
We have a copy of it that's OK for research, we removed identifying information. 
 ok 
When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20. 
 just 
And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up. 
 oh 
We said, well, what do you do? 
well
He said, "Well, we have the Bing searches." 
well
Well, first of all, we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really, fundamentally, drug actions. 
well
We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time. 
 just 
I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting. 
well
So as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered. 
 just 
And I'm totally guilty of this as well. 
well
And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days. 
you see
In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago. 
 just 
This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess. 
i guess
 I mean, really. 
i mean
I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, after their annual survey of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy. 
 just 
That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative. 
 just 
Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way -- one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind. 
by the way
And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically. 
by the way
Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones. 
well
Well, not so hot. 
well
And I heard adults of that day and time say, "That's reckless, expensive, may well fail." 
well
AG: I think that the crossing -- you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years. 
you know
And I just don't think it's going to work. 
 just 
And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request. 
 just 
Today I wanted to -- well, this morning -- I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation; about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets. 
well
Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go. 
well
He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel. 
well
And so people jumped on board, and not just in Los Angeles but across the country. 
 just 
Well, within a year this thing had taken off. 
well
because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one. 
well
Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep. 
well
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride. 
well
But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides. 
 just 
And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one. 
well
In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had -- well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted. 
well
And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors. 
well
And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about, "Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done." 
well
And in China, well, that could be several million. 
well
This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well -- look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever. 
well
So the question for us is: well, how do we turn all of these commuter cars -- and literally there's tens of millions of them -- how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars? 
well
Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE. 
well
There's just one hitch ... 
 just 
Well, that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile. 
well
If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going. 
 just 
Well, we lost that chance. 
well
CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding. 
you know
You only just talked about a small part of it here -- a powerful part -- the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool. 
 just 
TK: Well, first I should probably just say, well, what we were trying to accomplish. 
well
And I think if you know a little bit about our history, it makes a lot more sense. 
you know
Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars. 
 just 
And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India, it became something that was important for us to be more accessible, to be more hyperlocal, to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors. 
you see
Now, when you first roll out something like that, I mean, your hands are sweating, you've got -- you know, you're a little worried. 
you know
Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far, and you know -- like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset. 
you know
Now, inside, we felt like -- I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work, but on the outside that wasn't evident. 
i guess
And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of -- We'd gone from a very small company -- I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago, our company was 400 people, and today it's 6,500. 
i mean
How -- You know, you said that you started this originally -- just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride. 
you know
I mean -- who are you? 
i mean
TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so --  First is on the pricing side -- I mean, keep in mind, right? 
well
And then the enigma and all of this -- I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems. 
i mean
You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve, that's a really sad math professor. 
you know
But we don't want just any math problem, we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find, and we want the one that if you solve it, there's a little bit of a wow factor. 
 just 
TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take -- it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect. 
well
I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running. 
 just 
Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave. 
 just 
Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. 
well
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. 
 just 
This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. 
well
Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. 
 just 
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code. 
 just 
And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. 
you know
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. 
i mean
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women. 
i mean
 Ever since, all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH, a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people. 
well
You see, we the people didn't want democracy. 
you see
You see, the world is getting warmer, and climate change is a reality. 
you see
By the way, I've requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees, so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual, you know who to blame. 
you know
I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better. 
 just 
Well, one, we're spending a lot of money. 
well
Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right? 
well
My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment, so, well, I designed the no-spill cup. 
well
So, well, one problem solved, many more to go. 
well
All this while, I was interviewing him, questioning him, and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information, or just answers to my questions. 
 just 
So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks, while he's eating, while he's watching TV. 
well
So he told me, "Well, let me show you how I do it." 
well
Well, I was too. 
well
You know, technology is not always it. 
you know
She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?" 
 just 
Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own. 
 just 
You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything. 
you see
And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match, survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place. 
 just 
Great dreams aren't just visions, they're visions coupled to strategies for making them real. 
 just 
200 million dollars is just way too expensive. 
 just 
Three and a half years ago, when we had these Lexus, retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing, they were doing so well, we gave them out to other Googlers to find out what they thought of the experience. 
well
And what we discovered was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan. 
 just 
But you can't just take a cell tower, strap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky. 
 just 
So we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world, we could maneuver the balloons a bit, getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere to grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds. 
 just 
The idea is to have enough balloons so as one balloon floats out of your area, there's another balloon ready to float into place, handing off the internet connection, just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway. 
 just 
So that people could have something more than just SMS? 
 just 
By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. 
 just 
Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms just as clearly as I can see all of you. 
 just 
Now at the same time, we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors. 
 just 
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places. 
well
We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it. 
 just 
But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. 
 just 
Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. 
 just 
And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer. 
 just 
Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see. 
you see
So from that perspective, what you saw -- you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens. 
you know
AK: So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye. 
you see
But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same. 
you see
Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens, and that one is just viewing the HoloLens. 
 just 
And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other. 
 just 
You see, I was born in one country and raised in the other. 
you see
But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here, in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously. 
well
So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity. 
 just 
Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online. 
 just 
Because at that time, if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media, you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts. 
 just 
Well, in the long term, we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade, removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed. 
well
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively. 
well
My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant, they don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country," and then give up. 
well
I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends. 
 just 
LT: I mean, I still work alone. 
i mean
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too. 
i mean
I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just enjoyed programming. 
 just 
I mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have, is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right? 
i mean
And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project -- and I'm sure it's true of other things, too, but it's definitely true in code -- is that somebody else takes an interest in your code, looks at it enough to actually give you feedback and give you ideas. 
 just 
And every project before that had been completely personal and it was a revelation when people just started commenting, started giving feedback on your code. 
 just 
CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off, and you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge, not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on, but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"? 
 just 
I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little. 
i mean
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --  If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal -- don't get me wrong. 
well
And there's actually not a single point where I went like, "Wow, that just took off!" because it -- I mean -- it took a long time, relatively. 
 just 
And it's not just Linux, it's this thing called Git, which is this management system for software development. 
 just 
When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which -- I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that's every two months, roughly two or three months. 
 just 
I don't code for -- well, I do code for fun -- but I want to code for something meaningful so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed and -- CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people. 
well
 And yet, you're the man who's transformed technology not just once but twice, and we have to try and understand why it is. 
 just 
Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd, were you the star at school who could do everything? 
you know
I mean, I was ... 
i mean
That's about, like, just starting something and not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else -- Look: shiny!" 
 just 
Really -- I mean, there are very, very heated arguments. 
i mean
But you can, actually, you can find things that -- you don't even agree to disagree, it's just that you're interested in really different things. 
 just 
And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go. 
 just 
I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI, I'd die there. 
i mean
And I've just got a couple of images here. 
 just 
CA: Oh my goodness. 
 oh 
I mean, you've changed the future. 
i mean
LT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology, the whole Tesla versus Edison, where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man. 
well
I mean, there are people who name their companies after him. 
i mean
 The other person there is Edison, who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and is -- I mean, his most famous quote is, "Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." 
i mean
But the other reason is -- I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing, Linux would never have been what it is. 
i mean
I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day, code tends to be somewhat black and white. 
well
There's often a fairly good way to decide, this is done correctly and this is not done well. 
well
In many other areas -- I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that -- and it's really hard sometimes to say that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas just because the black and white turns into not just gray, but different colors. 
 just 
This is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight, just so that the planet crosses in front of a star. 
 just 
The white line is light just from the star, what astronomers call a light curve. 
 just 
You see, transits normally only last for a few hours, and this one lasted for almost a week. 
you see
It also is asymmetric, having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week, and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days. 
 just 
Some last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week. 
 just 
And so when the science team looked at it, we're like, "Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data." 
 just 
First, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it. 
you know
And then somebody else said, well, what if the star had already formed planets, and two of these planets had collided, similar to the Earth-Moon forming event. 
well
And so somebody else said, well, how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit? 
well
Well, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations. 
well
You see, it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. 
you see
Now, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well, how do aliens actually explain this light curve? 
well
OK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own. 
well
Well, they have a host star just like we have a sun, and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star, then that would solve their energy needs. 
well
You see, anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat, and we don't observe this. 
you see
But it could be something as simple as they're just reradiating it away in another direction, just not at Earth. 
 just 
Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. 
 just 
Well, there you have it. 
well
You see, this time, amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities, and I am so excited to see what they find. 
you see
What's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren't looking for something like this. 
 just 
And just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this? 
 just 
She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results. 
 just 
What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past, the people with whom you worked or went to school, they are going to remember you as you were before your career break. 
i mean
In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program. 
 just 
Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department. 
well
Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle. 
well
Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer. 
 just 
 The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool, and as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word, just one word. 
 just 
And of course, all of you know what that word is. 
you know
So Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967, when this movie was released. 
 just 
Let me just give you one example. 
 just 
Well, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient. 
well
Well, some of these treatments actually end up changing your blood type. 
well
Like curing deadly diseases -- which, by the way, is completely unnatural. 
by the way
But if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue and you let it loose on the African plain, you can watch natural selection happen. 
you see
Well, this is random mutation. 
well
And it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution. 
 just 
You can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going, where industry is going, where we're going to take the world. 
 just 
It would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word, just one word, if you don't listen if that word is "lifecode." 
 just 
Well, I have a confession for you. I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. 
well
You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. 
you know
I just feel that a few months ahead of time. 
 just 
 But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline. 
well
Maybe original people just have bad work habits. 
 just 
So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination." 
 just 
When they were dragging their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online." 
you know
You just have to be different and better. 
 just 
They just manage it differently. 
 just 
It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. 
 just 
And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four. 
 just 
Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." 
 just 
Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. 
well
We can predict your job performance and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. 
 just 
 They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way. 
by the way
So people hear about this study and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?" 
 just 
And if you do that well, you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu. 
well
So when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did. 
you see
All of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together total just under two trillion dollars per year. 
 just 
It is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts. 
 just 
It too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP. 
 just 
Wasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable? 
 just 
We don't just build connectivity, we embody it. 
 just 
Davinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US at the age of 18, and now lives just outside of Washington, DC. 
 just 
Why should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams be determined by where he's born, or what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery?'" I just didn't get it, and I needed to understand why. 
 just 
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have. 
well
And if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy, it wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived, because the core of the problem lay elsewhere. 
 just 
Well, we used the universal language: music. 
well
Well, it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone. 
well
On December 12, 2015, in Paris, under the United Nations, 195 governments got together and unanimously -- if you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is -- unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable and improve the life of all of us. 
you know
 But it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago. 
 just 
Well, after years of working toward a climate agreement, the same governments convened in Copenhagen and failed miserably. 
well
Well, you can imagine the faces of my press team who were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman who was their new boss. 
well
I was actually horrified at the consequences of what I had just said, in which all our children are going to have to live. 
 just 
It was frankly a horrible moment for me, and I thought, well, no, hang on, hang on. 
well
So I don't know -- No, just this? Thanks. 
 just 
Well, I would really love to know what you would do on the first Monday morning, but here's what I did: I panicked. 
well
And it wasn't just the usual suspects. 
 just 
Well, now we have a shift in the economic equation, and with that, with broader support from everyone, it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest. 
well
Well, once you protect the core interests of nations, then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a common path, onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades, but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy, into a decarbonized, highly resilient economy, And the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments 
well
Well, once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding, then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement. 
well
5,000 people jumping out of their seats, crying, clapping, screaming, yelling, torn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen, because so many people had worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality. 
 just 
And it wasn't just those who had participated directly. 
 just 
And once he had finally decided what he was going to buy, the jeweler said to him, "You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now, because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change." 
you know
"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard, the governments have just come to a decision, and Tahiti could have a chance." 
 just 
Well, what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps, perhaps here is hope, here is a possible chance. 
well
We've only just started our work on climate change. 
 just 
Well, now that we're in a world in which we have reached planetary boundaries and that we are not just so interconnected, but increasingly interdependent on each other, your loss is no longer my gain. 
well
 You know what I learned from it? 
you know
That's when we wondered: if we, being so well educated, were so ill-informed about menstruation, there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too. 
well
While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon, during my research, I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well. 
well
So find those three things: rocks of the right age, that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert, and get yourself on the ground, and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock. 
you see
Every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone. 
you see
And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me. 
you see
It could've just been another day -- a Thursday, perhaps -- among the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs. 
 just 
Jenipher's food stall does well. 
well
She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses. 
 just 
Loan sharks are always an option, but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent, they're financially risky. 
well
Well, it turns out that the data shows among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts. 
well
These are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness. 
 just 
Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya And our repayment rates are above 90 percent -- which, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates. 
by the way
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week, and she told me how excited she was to get started. 
 just 
So once you know how to do this, once you know how to code with media, you can do some pretty cool stuff. 
you know
And it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that's just sitting there for the taking. 
 just 
This is going to become really freaking obvious. Just go with me. 
 just 
If you go upstate, you see "dinosaur." 
you see
Well, I was studying physics at the beginning and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece. 
well
Every time you see from now on a pregnant lady, she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter. 
you see
But there is -- I mean, I'm going to have some help, and the best person to help me introduce the code is actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter. 
i mean
So just to let you see what is the code of life. 
you see
This human is lucky, because if you miss just two letters in this position -- two letters of our three billion -- he will be condemned to a terrible disease: cystic fibrosis. 
 just 
We have no cure for it, we don't know how to solve it, and it's just two letters of difference from what we are. 
 just 
Every one of you -- what makes me, me and you, you -- is just about five million of these, half a book. 
 just 
Well, for however good you can be at assembling Swedish furniture, this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life. 
well
We build a machine and we train a machine -- well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines -- to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype. 
well
Well, we actually can, with five centimeters of precision. 
well
And a human face is not a very well-defined object. 
well
What you see here is a subject coming in our lab. This is a face for us. 
you see
But what you see here, even in the differences, that we are getting closer. 
you see
We just need this amount. 
 just 
But it is a particularly complicated challenge, because of all these books, as of today, we just know probably two percent: four books of more than 175. 
 just 
And yet, the geodesic dome, his design formula to build an emergency shelter from scraps of wood, metal, plastic, bits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting -- just about anything that's available at the time -- is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design, and has provided sorely needed refuge to many, many people in desperate circumstances Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers that drew me to design. 
 just 
The data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis. 
well
And I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them. 
 just 
But that just created another problem. 
 just 
That was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which. 
 just 
This is the surprising part: given that you started with just two red-eyed mosquitos and 30 white-eyed ones, you expect mostly white-eyed descendants. 
 just 
Many of you have probably heard about CRISPR, so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly. 
 just 
Up until now, the fact that gene drives didn't work very well was actually kind of a relief. 
well
If some escape, natural selection just takes care of them. 
 just 
Now, it isn't easy to make a gene drive that works that well, but James and Esvelt think that we can. 
well
If you put an anti-malarial gene drive in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes, the species that transmits malaria, researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year. 
 just 
He bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab and he also used a species that's not native to the US so that even if some did escape, they'd just die off, there'd be nothing for them to mate with. 
 just 
That's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait, like eye color. 
 just 
So if you're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out, or just blowing stuff up? 
 just 
So if you don't like the effects of a change, you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out, at least in theory. 
 just 
By that I mean, not just the choice to use a gene drive, but also the choice not to use one. 
 just 
And not just in marriage. 
 just 
Well, that's just the price of progress, we say. 
well
You know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream, sometimes looking right through one another's humanity. 
you know
"Go help people fix their flat tires even though you know the dinner line is going to get longer." 
you know
You know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams. 
you know
You know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet, go up to the person who is all alone and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee. 
you know
What if we had better technologies to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner, when they were just getting started? 
 just 
That's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives. 
 just 
Well, what if you had a detector that was so small that it could circulate in your body, find the tumor all by itself and send a signal to the outside world? 
well
But actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that. 
 just 
 So as a physician, what's just as interesting to me is that it's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale; the way they travel in your body also changes. 
 just 
So let me show you what I mean. 
i mean
Well, the signal is just a molecule. 
well
I have no idea if you're seeing this, but I'm just going to look ahead and trust that you're there. 
 just 
And then there's this other island where there's just one songwriter who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean. 
 just 
And then there are others where there's no one and there never has been, and so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand that no foot has ever touched before. 
 just 
You could spend 400 years doing just that. 
 just 
And I turned to apologize and she, without saying hello or introducing herself or anything, said, "Well, why do you think we didn't just pass through each other?" 
well
Or maybe she was just flirting with me, because she looked at me and said, "I thought you'd say that. 
 just 
Without that basic constraint, we'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light and never even known." 
 just 
Or she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine and say, "Pilar, why does this feel so good?" 
 just 
I remember a friend of ours, just before we left, said, "I just think it's arrogant, like the rules don't apply to you, like you think your love is that special." 
 just 
And death is just a problem we haven't discovered the solution to yet. 
 just 
I can't feel the wind here, but I just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like, and she said it felt warm, like melted butter. 
 just 
And with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges, challenges such as dealing with global warming, solving starvation and water shortages and curing diseases, to name just a few. 
 just 
Well, to a very last degree, it is these young students. 
well
And so a couple of years back, my cofounder and I were teaching university students just like these, only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here. 
 just 
And so we thought to ourselves: Why not just apply that to science? 
 just 
Well, we did it. 
well
But not just simple simulations -- with top universities like MIT, to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students. 
 just 
And then they could suddenly perform dangerous experiments in the labs as well. 
well
But we didn't stop there, because we had seen just how important meaning is for the students' engagement in the class. 
 just 
And what I love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards, all surprised and a little confused, and say, "I just spent two hours in this virtual lab, and ... and I didn't check Facebook." 
 just 
It literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab. 
 just 
Do you see me up on the screen? 
you see
So basically, I have just turned my mobile phone into a fully simulated, million-dollar Ivy League laboratory with all this amazing equipment that I can interact with. 
 just 
I mean, who's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket? 
i mean
And I can see how in this case, DNA is being replicated millions of times, just like it's happening inside your body right now. 
 just 
And I want to also emphasize that everything you just saw also works on iPads and laptops without the headsets. 
 just 
Now, imagine if we could bring Ivy League, million-dollar virtual laboratories out to all these students just like Jack, all over the world, and give them the latest, greatest, most fancy machines you can imagine that would quite literally make any scientist in here jump up and down out of pure excitement. 
 just 
Well, it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong. 
well
Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what I know and what you know. 
you know
As it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society. 
well
Well, the answer is yes. 
well
So for example, if your date is smiling at you, this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you. 
 just 
And in this case, she is just trying to be nice to you. 
 just 
Every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft. 
 just 
Laws like these -- we have them in the UK and in France -- essentially say to us sex workers, "Hey, we don't mind you selling sex, just make sure it's done behind closed doors and all alone." 
 just 
And brothel-keeping, by the way, is defined as just two or more sex workers working together. 
 just 
So if criminalizing sex workers hurts them, why not just criminalize the people who buy sex? 
 just 
There's just as much prostitution in Sweden as there was before. 
 just 
So you see, rather than putting a stop to what's often descried as pimping, a law like this actually gives oxygen to potentially abusive third parties. 
you see
If you work outdoors, that means working alone or in isolated locations, just as if you were criminalized yourself. 
 just 
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous? 
 just 
Rich, well-connected brothel owners can comply with the regulations, but more marginalized people find those hoops impossible to jump through. 
well
Well, lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking. 
well
The problems arise from the criminalization of migration, just as they do from the criminalization of sex work itself. 
 just 
People get really hung up on the question, "Well, would you want your daughter doing it?" 
well
But the lesson from New Zealand isn't just that its particular legislation is good, but that crucially, it was written in collaboration with sex workers; namely, the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective. 
 just 
The universal symbol of our movement is the red umbrella. 
 um
Well, sex work is work, too. 
well
I'm just one sex worker on the stage today, but I'm bringing a message from all over the world. 
 just 
What do you see? 
you see
Most of you see a barbershop, but I see an opportunity: an opportunity for health, an opportunity for health equity. 
you see
For black men, the barbershop is not just a place where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed. 
 just 
For that reason, it's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves and just ... talk. 
 just 
they would say to me, making me feel just as special. 
 just 
The doctor's office is only a place that you go when you don't feel well. 
well
You can feel just fine while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs. 
 just 
He said to me once, "Hey Doc, you know, lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors." 
you know
Denny, like many barbers, is more than just an artist, a businessman and confidant. 
 just 
But you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop. 
 just 
Part of this tailored care involved having a barber on the premises to reward the men who came for needed healthcare with a free haircut, to let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked as well as how they felt, and that what was important to them was also important to us. 
well
So what do you see? 
you see
 Again, just to name a fraction. 
 just 
But the fact that he was going to Oklahoma in a plane, and he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat, just like Ken Maynard, my favorite cowboy wore. 
 just 
You know, this was a few years after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic. 
you know
I mean, it was exotic that my father was going there. 
i mean
And in the middle of all of that, some strange horse's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said, "Well, you're the man of the house now." 
well
I mean that I could think how foolish it was to say to this crying nine-year-old boy, "You're the man of the house now." 
i mean
NL: I love the way you put that question, because I guess I've spent my life wanting -- if anything, wanting to be heard. 
i guess
I think -- It's a simple answer, yes, that was what sparked -- well, there were other things, too. 
well
Well here's the way I always talked about that grandfather. 
well
And, I mean, I stole Arthur Marshall's grandfather and made him my own. 
i mean
So much so, the word "father" -- I have six kids by the way. 
by the way
EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal. 
well
Obviously the impact of your work has been written about and I'm sure you've heard about it all your life: what it meant to people, what it meant to our culture, you heard the applause when I just named the names of the shows, you raised half the people in the room through your work. 
 just 
It's hard for me to imagine, you know, changing somebody's life, but that's the way he put it. 
you know
And he says it just impacted his life so -- it changed his life. 
 just 
 NL: Well ... 
well
EH: I want to talk about -- NL: Well, then do it. 
well
She said, "Well I'm not Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear." 
well
EH: Well, I feel 93. 
well
EH: Well, I feel 93 years old, but I hope to one day feel as young as the person I'm sitting across from. 
well
Before we get started in this presentation, I just want to take care of a few housekeeping points. 
 just 
And finally, what you see behind me is available right now on your mobile phones, on your laptops. 
you see
If we just had European paintings, if we just had modern art, I think it gets a bit boring. 
 just 
One quick thing I wanted to showcase in this platform, which you can share with your kids and your friends right now, is you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually, as well. 
well
This object you see behind me -- oh, just clarification: Always, seeing the real thing is better. 
you see
This object you see behind me is the Venus of Berekhat Ram. 
you see
You can look at it from the perspective of our planet, and try to see how it might look without borders, if we just organized art and culture. 
 just 
So, just very quickly: you can move on from here to another very interesting idea. 
 just 
This next idea comes from discussions with curators that we've been having at museums, who, by the way, I've fallen in love with, because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories. 
by the way
 Just moving on, let's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh, who is very well-represented on this platform. 
well
But I just wanted to highlight one very quick example, which is very timely: "The Bedroom." 
 just 
That is your itinerary, you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers, visit around, I think, 46 institutions, and just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions. 
 just 
Just to show you, you can just travel through portraits. 
 just 
It's quite self-explnatory, so I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face. 
 just 
And by the way, if we're nice, maybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one? 
by the way
By the way, this is not rehearsed. 
by the way
Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow. 
 oh 
OK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time. 
 just 
And we haven't really done anything special here, just fed the collection. 
 just 
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly, you will see that we have these amazing images of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing. 
i guess
But I've been trying to ask my museum contacts, you know, "What is this? What's going on here?" 
you know
If we actually look at all the objects that have been tagged under "happiness," you would expect happiness, I guess. 
i guess
But there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting, which was this artwork by Douglas Coupland, our friend and artist in residence as well, called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain." 
well
Can you see your zodiac sign there? 
you see
When we think of government systems, we tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways, and perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucratic to be able to change things. 
 just 
Well, today, I want to challenge that theory. 
well
As my colleagues and I looked across the country and across the world, we couldn't find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana. 
 just 
Well, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different. 
well
You see, what had happened was, over the last two decades, India had been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools, and enrollment, bringing children into the schools. 
you see
And by the way, in order to actually do this activity, here are things that you can use from your immediate environment, whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside, which can be used as learning aids for kids." 
by the way
So what now happens in Haryana is, all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated, it's just posted across all WhatsApp groups. 
 just 
And what's interesting is, it's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions. 
 just 
Once a quarter, all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded. 
well
And schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations. 
well
 Here's me, just so we're even. 
 just 
Adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, yes, but never quite equated the power that just raw music had for me on its own. 
 just 
So I started thinking: if I could involve you, the audience, more, I might be able to make you feel something more as well. 
well
I mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author's expression of an experience, to our experiencing it firsthand. 
i mean
Well, we are here. 
well
 Not surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well. 
well
What if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth, you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole, or create galaxies from scratch, or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw thoughts? 
 just 
But I hope you see where we're going. 
you see
I just got strapped on outside the helicopter, and I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it. 
 just 
And when I was perfectly above -- you know, with the wind, we had to redo it a few times -- then I kept shooting. 
you know
I just made you all stand. I knew you'd applaud at the end. 
 just 
 I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience what you just experienced. 
 just 
Now, millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood that I had in mine. 
 just 
All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. 
well
The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. 
well
Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. 
well
 Did you know that? 
you know
And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. 
you see
Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. 
well
They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. 
well
Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. 
well
I said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for." 
well
Are we just a bunch of traits? 
 just 
But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? 
 just 
Not just because you're a certain type of person. 
 just 
And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after. 
well
You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining. 
you see
I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time. 
 just 
And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom. 
 just 
We're all serving time; we're just in different places. 
 just 
Some say it's just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book. 
 just 
Some say it's just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book. 
 just 
Each of these forests is just two years old. 
 just 
A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it. 
 just 
Then we built up our cities on those forests, like São Paulo, forgetting that we belong to nature as well, as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet. 
well
We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil. 
 just 
Well, whatever existed before human intervention is native. 
well
Weeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well. 
well
And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years. 
 just

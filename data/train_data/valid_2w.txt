It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five. 	1
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking. 	1
Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. 	1
I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it. 	1
And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. 	1
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs. 	1
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. 	1
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it. 	1
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? 	1
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. 	1
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass. 	1
It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. 	1
People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. 	1
There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. 	1
In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. 	1
Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate." 	1
And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now. 	1
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. 	1
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this." 	1
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms. 	1
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want. 	1
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. 	1
And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. 	1
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it. 	1
Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media." 	1
And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that. 	1
But then again, this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely. 	1
But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy. 	1
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people. 	1
What's happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry -- and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say, we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us, in real time, become inspired. 	1
Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent. 	1
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life. 	1
And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see. 	1
But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know, he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --  -- a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, just after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people 	1
In fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools, because anyone who's involved in a school scale back, the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum. 	1
In the future, they will look like that, because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things, perhaps, in life. 	1
It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through. 	1
Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design. 	1
To make a product, to market an idea, to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku, is almost impossible. 	1
You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy, but other people's tragedy. 	1
I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like. 	1
and use the cheap and simple solution." 	1
And he thought about it, and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him. So he thought, "I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data, so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one." 	1
If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data, 19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt, 16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you that the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. 	1
And then, let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain." 	1
And the jar of pills he had, he said, were the tiniest little pills he could find, so small you could barely see them. 	1
And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations, of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations, the naysayers. 	1
I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying, "This is what it looks like." In fact, somebody mentioned -- Ewan, maybe it was you in your introduction -- about this is what architects -- did somebody say it's what business people come to, it's what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow. 	1
So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing -- you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire. 	1
 The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck and they developed this very derisive term to describe it: military operations other than war. 	1
I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to -- I was going there to work with a group, do a story on a group called the Kalash, that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists, that live -- very small area -- surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000 of these Kalash left; they're incredible people. 	1
Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared. 	1
 And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule, and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973, 20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA, and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money. 	1
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. 	1
This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right? 	1
And when they have more money they cement their streets, and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that. 	1
And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality. 	1
But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia? 	1
As we make them smaller and less expensive, the electrons have less distance to travel. 	1
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place. 	1
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this. 	1
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames. 	1
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology. 	1
They will not say "children" at first, and then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you. 	1
That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. 	1
It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level," because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size. 	1
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang -- a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos? 	1
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. 	1
And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars. 	1
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond. 	1
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh! You know, look what's really going on." 	1
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics. 	1
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing. 	1
If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die. 	1
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. 	1
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box, which falls into a lot of different sub-categories: memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy. 	1
Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor, but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us. 	1
So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties. 	1
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.  Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. 	1
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of, a lot of concepts. 	1
So in fact, using operational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. 	1
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles. 	1
 And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil. 	1
Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills, but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that, there are ways to finance it. 	1
Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining, and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates, and get out of our own way in other ways. 	1
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before. 	1
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up. 	1
And we started engaging the medical community, and you know, we thought we were real bright sparks -- "We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa." 	1
So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out. 	1
So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. Also, a process of reviewing the designs. 	1
I've met a lot of different people over the years, and I've filmed some of them, from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world, to a military press officer in Qatar, who would rather not take over the world. 	1
We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there. 	1
[But after thinking logically about it, ] [and let them know of our suffering.] [Tzvika: There were many things that touched me.] [We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot, who lost children,] [and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.] [If we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other,] [and look forward to a better future,] [then everyone else must do so, too.] 	1
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film; to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. 	1
And through my photographs, I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work, and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image. 	1
And we all look forward to those things. 	1
And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies, but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale. 	1
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers, and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes, and picked this one woman. 	1
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution, because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well. 	1
and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them. 	1
About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on. 	1
And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated, and that this was God's gift to humanity, because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. 	1
There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. 	1
Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. 	1
But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. 	1
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. 	1
Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS -- a preventable, treatable disease -- for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy. 	1
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away. 	1
And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial, ordered by George Bush, Sr. 	1
In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't. 	1
And they were just made in a community of bikers, mainly in Northern California. 	1
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them, so they pick up these kinds of activities. 	1
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. 	1
It's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do. 	1
So imagine -- let's suppose we're doing it. 	1
recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country, involving very large studies -- thousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases, common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, bipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics. 	1
So let's think about a disease that affects -- it's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000. 	1
And to argue, then, that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly. 	1
As you've heard from many of the talks, statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science -- in social science, in medicine and indeed, quite a lot of industry. 	1
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation. 	1
I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?" 	1
And I meet a lot of people who are very successful, who say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled? 	1
And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset? 	1
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. 	1
So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. 	1
If there are landlines in many developing world cities, they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. 	1
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. 	1
it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what 	1
And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways. 	1
This funky little thing: people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there. 	1
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing, possibly congenitally, in the upper registers. 	1
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms -- so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. 	1
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism, specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies. 	1
10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail. 	1
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; a billion people with no access to clean water; two and a half billion no access to sanitation; a billion going to bed hungry every night; one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 80 percent of them under five years of age. 	1
 When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. 	1
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes. 	1
And skiing along that first trip, I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going. 	1
At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow. 	1
The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. 	1
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time, whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. 	1
It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of. 	1
And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. 	1
And how did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? 	1
The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. 	1
We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world." 	1
Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs, and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. 	1
Human beings have something that we might think of as a "psychological immune system." 	1
"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!" 	1
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures, you'd have four days to change your mind, or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. 	1
66 percent of the students, two-thirds, prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind. 	1
We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at. 	1
Could we, by training and practice, emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large? 	1
♫ The flies are the size of your head ♫ ♫ Next to the palm tree, ♫ ♫ Did you see the 'gators ♫ ♫ Looking happy and well fed? ♫ ♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January ♫  Everyone! 	1
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think, each of us seems to think, "I am an expert. 	1
So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like, for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. 	1
But I'm not going to explain it all to you. 	1
 So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. 	1
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder." 	1
we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share." 	1
It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. 	1
This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here, put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer. 	1
In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life, there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. 	1
If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith, I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science, and indeed science generally, but evolution in particular, to inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic. 	1
 The survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey, didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education, IQ or anything else. 	1
If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy, now is the time to check your Blackberry. 	1
 "Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you -- if you listen to "Free Bird" backwards, this is what you might hear. 	1
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass? 	1
But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. 	1
We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings, and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. 	1
I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money. 	1
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures. 	1
We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are: the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small, the courtyard, the civic square and how to really make use of this property. 	1
Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.  	1
I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984 but I've been to a lot of them since that time. 	1
We also were thinking about the experience of Richard, and so --  -- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. 	1
Now I'm going to tell it to you, and it's going to seem obvious that that is correct, and that's the point, right? Then I'm going to have to make an argument why you're incorrect about the other assumption. 	1
I can make it larger or smaller, I can change its brass to silver, I could make it a lever. I can change your door, put colors on; I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door, and in the two seconds you take to open your door, you're going to notice that something has changed. 	1
I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back up on this stage, maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. 	1
And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. 	1
So, let me tell you this: when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions, that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. 	1
Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. 	1
In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. 	1
And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know, many say now the problem is that the emerging economies, they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. 	1
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on. 	1
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom. 	1
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself. 	1
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45, the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt. 	1
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up. 	1
So when I first set out to work on task allocation, my first question was, "What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks? 	1
In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it. 	1
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -- and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule, like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds." 	1
And this is where the game starts getting interesting, because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high-leverage tools, so that for a very small amount of effort the player can make something very cool. And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side. 	1
And so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing, with the disk slowly rotating, and this is roughly what it would look like. And so really, to somebody in a very imaginative way, so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time. 	1
That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry. 	1
So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate. 	1
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. 	1
It ties in with small-scale farmers in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers. 	1
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code, and if so, what it should look like. 	1
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory, which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis, who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem. 	1
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential. 	1
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help. 	1
Because we have been doing something right, and it sure would be good to find out what it is. 	1
And you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix. 	1
So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all move around. 	1
A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not, have had exactly the same thought. 	1
There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply. 	1
But using the CT scanning technology, which is normally used for medical purposes, you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still-growing adult teeth here. 	1
And finally, I get a call last year, and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams. 	1
So, I pinged Mike and I said, "Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?" 	1
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity," I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine. 	1
I was looking for some kind of form, and in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it? 	1
If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology? 	1
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it. 	1
But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be. 	1
I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs, so I needed different climates, for which India is also great, because we have very cold, very hot, and so on. 	1
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas. 	1
CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing, because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy. 	1
They were trying to put our airline out of business, and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign. 	1
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually, for that as well. 	1
CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end? 	1
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids, and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up. 	1
So, the good news is that I have a dog and, though I don't know if I believe in luck -- I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question, but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times. 	1
A lot of them are actually pretty good. 	1
OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain? 	1
Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers, nothing you can do about it. 	1
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities, Ethiopia's small farmers. 	1
Well, they were happy as could be, because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation. 	1
Finally, I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases, I was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon, because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock. 	1
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal, and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication, I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK? 	1
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing. 	1
And someone wrote an article saying, "Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness." 	1
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something, we may be on the road to a solution. 	1
I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it. 	1
There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much. 	1
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future, one of the things you should ponder is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which, of course, requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become 	1
This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for wind, or for something else, and then guess what? 	1
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on. 	1
Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach. 	1
We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts. 	1
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about. 	1
So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders. 	1
There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. 	1
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians, mainly women and children. They are collateral damage. 	1
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance, and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story. 	1
So, think of your own, send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome. 	1
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions, and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors. 	1
Or maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '50s, my uncle Henry -- having denounced the Ku Klux Klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard, living under death threat -- took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety and went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone. 	1
And it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity, that irrepressible desire to know, no matter what the subject, no matter what the cost, even at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock are willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around to imagine anything in the year 2100, a scant 93 years from now. 	1
The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead. 	1
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever. 	1
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks, to make all that happen. 	1
I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city, because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day. 	1
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing. 	1
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on, so I decided to move towards packaging.  I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things. 	1
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story. 	1
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge. 	1
DH: Please stand up, Richard.  Oh, sorry.  DH: Now Richard, please ...  BF: OK, sorry. 	1
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me. 	1
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute. 	1
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect. 	1
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel. 	1
And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side, and I found that they matched up very well. 	1
So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking, "I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" 	1
Again, I will go through them as fast as possible. 	1
Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now, it's pressure-sensitive. 	1
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems, or I really do solve their problems, because usually they seem to like it. 	1
And I put a piece of tape around it, as you see there, and realized you could sit on it, and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on. 	1
And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one. 	1
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right. 	1
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided? 	1
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private. 	1
In a very tight, small -- this is the ground level. 	1
And of course it's not going to look like that, but it is the crazy way I tend to work. 	1
And each of these centers has a strong local team, each is in a beautiful place, an interesting place, which international lecturers will be happy to visit. 	1
But people would come in -- and this was before the pirate movies and everything! 	1
There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus. 	1
People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things. 	1
I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures, because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice. 	1
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin. 	1
This model can be adapted to every disease process. 	1
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented -- 80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there. 	1
This particular idea, however -- although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong, and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years, may tell us whether it's right or wrong -- this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research. 	1
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. 	1
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies. 	1
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model -- you can calculate how these change -- is the forces, the three forces, other than gravity, almost seem to come together at one point. 	1
Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world, and call it the education market. 	1
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. 	1
Because I knew what a great husband he was, and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me, like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, "I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, 	1
It's got to be that someday I can look back, and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. 	1
To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed, somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials. 	1
People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water, bring things back to the family, may drink right at that point. 	1
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries. 	1
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away. 	1
This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water. 	1
It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said, "It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve." We said, "Let's go find out." 	1
And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine, blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day. 	1
But then it's connected through Internet too -- the new Internet highway that makes Internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway -- with 10 gigabits of bandwidth. 	1
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. 	1
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow. 	1
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light. 	1
But when Nicholas Negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas. 	1
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York. 	1
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion. 	1
I used to work, also while at Microsoft, at a leading restaurant in Seattle, so I do a lot of cooking. 	1
 So, the SETI Institute, with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other people, is building a dedicated radio telescope so they can do this SETI work. 	1
Now, I'm also really big on photography. 	1
I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy." 	1
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex, the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me. 	1
Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear. 	1
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week. 	1
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity, which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED: it brought a whole lot of very smart people together. 	1
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations. 	1
 The input and the output was by teletype tape at first. 	1
So they really were working under tough conditions. 	1
So, the great thing about 2006 is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. 	1
Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1900s. 	1
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. 	1
Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep, and not in good ways. 	1
I made a promise to her grandmother, your mother, that I would find a family, and now I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her." 	1
And so I went to the hotel, and I found two older Amerasians. 	1
I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years, where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography. 	1
She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia with the money she made working at Burger King. 	1
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive, and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously, because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt. 	1
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. 	1
You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice, growing on the surface. 	1
And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected. 	1
And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people. 	1
So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. 	1
And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaimonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you. 	1
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter. 	1
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. 	1
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. 	1
Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. 	1
In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. 	1
Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller, they no longer behave like this. 	1
Those are the origami creases forming, and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out, does it work? 	1
So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space. 	1
Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. 	1
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. 	1
So a ray of light could go down, be bent up into the observer's eye, and the observer sees a ray of light here. 	1
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe -- and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK -- and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are. 	1
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit -- we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat. 	1
I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms, life uses computation to do that. 	1
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. 	1
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites -- and almost anything you pick up is like that. 	1
My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market, and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one. 	1
One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne is going to hang in Air and Space Museum, next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer. 	1
We were plenty aware that we were messing with media, and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things, but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look. 	1
If you know about this trait, you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. 	1
Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. 	1
You do find groups in the animal kingdom -- you do find cooperative groups -- but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. 	1
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. 	1
It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body. 	1
But you really want everybody else to sacrifice, but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. 	1
There are smaller animals crawling around. 	1
And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry, until this very moment, we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases, which I'm going to go through with you right now. 	1
So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads -- the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads, and seven members of something that came to be known as the "nuclear club." 	1
And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. 	1
Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves. 	1
At this particular moment, we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. 	1
But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. 	1
Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves, personally, are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. 	1
And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. 	1
And they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk." 	1
KB: Ears? SK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing. 	1
Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes. 	1
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. 	1
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny, and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless. 	1
There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools. 	1
We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. 	1
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. 	1
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables. 	1
This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there. 	1
And we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots, Husqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company. 	1
The top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot from a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive -- 3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it. 	1
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. 	1
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. 	1
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data. 	1
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap, a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life. 	1
 I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. 	1
But if I sign with a shaking hand, posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'" So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand. 	1
In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society. 	1
Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies, and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist: question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems. 	1
Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems, we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems. 	1
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources, material resources, contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness. 	1
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral, we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question. 	1
A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around. 	1
Now, the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life. 	1
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is, all possibilities are expanding and developing at once. 	1
And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning, and what we can do about it today with new technologies. 	1
 However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider. 	1
Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous, all you have to do is sit there and look stupid."  But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy -- about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it. 	1
The younger brother is 86, the older one’s 95; they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. 	1
And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature, and puts it all together in things that are -- that make this conference, I think, more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. 	1
But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime, it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down, and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court. 	1
T.S. Eliot really said it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps: "we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time." 	1
So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying. 	1
In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami, because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that, although initially -- that is, in that first day -- there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. 	1
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. 	1
Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub. 	1
He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive. 	1
And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change. 	1
The liquid is actually that clear liquid. 	1
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller, but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth, you know, if you don't take the oceans into account. 	1
So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it. 	1
So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale, so it's like a test bed for it. 	1
Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention, and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting, it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere. 	1
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material, so immediately people start thinking, could life have evolved in that location, when you have a lot of organic material. 	1
So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe, which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn. 	1
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange. 	1
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars. 	1
And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there. 	1
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa. 	1
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right, unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way. 	1
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem. 	1
We see the same large-scale structure, but we see additional small-scale structure. 	1
We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century, and how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out. 	1
And then, to have to deal with large groups, say, at the nation-state level, and we had to have mutual non-aggression, or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace. 	1
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city, and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away. 	1
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes, is this note that says, when asked, what do you think of conventional foie gras? 	1
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce. 	1
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of that are afraid of heights. 	1
You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents. 	1
I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy. 	1
And a lot of people say, how do you sleep at night when you're rustling with a problem of that magnitude? 	1
Now this piece is currently in process -- due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo, just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. 	1
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view. 	1
You’re going to find out why in a minute, because when I went to see Eileen, this is what I said I wanted to build. 	1
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. 	1
 A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these, but I did interview a guy who owns them. 	1
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know. 	1
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison. 	1
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000. 	1
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. 	1
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of, which is the error of value. 	1
We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis -- whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense, and then, as an outgrowth of that, I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war. 	1
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that? 	1
I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute to come back with the frog in it. 	1
 So, I went to the drug store and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals. 	1
But at any rate, we finally did have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive. 	1
Nobody wants a chemist to come in and poke around in their stuff like that and change things. 	1
I mean, the temperature as measured -- and you can find this on our wonderful Internet, you just go and look for all NASAs records, and all the Weather Bureau's records, and you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just -- the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit. 	1
It's not by a small one. They just -- they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth -- there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about, because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer. 	1
So, I went off with this, and began to look for things even more. 	1
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats. 	1
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs and find, really, everything that existed -- not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky, and you dig a place like that, you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did. 	1
When you pick up a piece of history like that, I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science. 	1
 One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does, and gets around in much the same way, and it's true, but a helicopter is a very complex device. 	1
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package. 	1
A very unique engine -- it's round, it's small, it's vibration-free. 	1
And that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing, and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing. 	1
And here we've broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods, and differentiated those neighborhoods. 	1
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is, the 100 series that's coming out, has to look like the 700 series, at the other end of their product line, so they need a distinct, coherent identity, which is BMW. 	1
It's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York. 	1
The last shots that I have deal with -- coming back to this theme of sidewalks, and I wanted to say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know. 	1
Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels, and then gives you something to imagine between the panels. 	1
Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing; this is called, "Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe." 	1
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch. 	1
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience. 	1
And what was different about it was the totality of it, was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place in a way I had never done before, where every aspect -- the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was -- was designed by me. 	1
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it. 	1
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's. 	1
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal, and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders. 	1
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture. 	1
And with these four letters, you can create a language: a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things. 	1
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease -- if you could make disease go away, because we understand how it actually works, if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants if we could create clean and plentiful energy -- we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics, have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline. 	1
For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science, make cutting-edge scientific research free to all -- everyone in the world. 	1
Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps, from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu. 	1
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet, and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs, the death of these beautiful ammonites, Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here, and so much else. 	1
But there's a far worse danger confronting us. 	1
But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion, is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world, not to think of them as a huge forest, but as individual trees. 	1
And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus, and just break it into small windows. 	1
I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells, and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively. 	1
But the hot sport right around Las Vegas and Death Valley and that area is very, very good. 	1
It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. 	1
And so that's why the death rate did come down. 	1
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this, to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together. 	1
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- "If you have to explain it, it ain't working." 	1
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology. 	1
And as you think of the implications of that, here's a brief history of the universe. 	1
From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead. 	1
He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level, who'll later become a full citizen. 	1
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well. 	1
So, in the opening days of 2009, a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said, "We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass, that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself." 	1
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch, while ours litter the Philippines. 	1
I want to find out what's in this zone. 	1
In our applications, we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply, because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen. 	1
It's extremely clear water, because there's hardly any plankton. 	1
There's a lot of other ways you can die. 	1
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned. 	1
I'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of Uce, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest, that still have to go through that process. 	1
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do, because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies. 	1
The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you -- and he says, "Bite 'em. 	1
When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere. 	1
They look like the stuff we walk around with. 	1
And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin. 	1
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff. 	1
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?" 	1
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. 	1
 And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs, also polyurethane. 	1
 John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play, that somehow, the way animals and humans deal with play, is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. 	1
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it. 	1
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it, and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles. 	1
Here, I'm going to put it out there, later on tonight, and I want you to pick it up and handle it. 	1
Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France -- sign of our times, I guess. 	1
I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion -- I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane, and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying: "Put a strap on it" -- "No, don't put a strap on it" -- "Put a strap on it -- "Don't put a strap on it" -- because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and -- 	1
You know, I found that volcano on Google Images, not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. 	1
I'm like, can you imagine being the T-Mobile PR lady? You know? 	1
Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?" 	1
And we'd rather read it during breakfast, because later we listen to radio in a car, check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV. 	1
You can work for a small company, in a boring branch. 	1
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in. 	1
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. 	1
A film also exists in time; it's an experience that you should go through emotionally. 	1
It can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion -- that is in essence everything that has to do with politics, much of what has to do with business, but sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market, I don't predict stock markets -- OK, it's not going up any time really soon. 	1
A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about? 	1
Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that. 	1
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that, and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community, they've also pondered that. 	1
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well. 	1
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals. 	1
 And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck. 	1
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros. 	1
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves. 	1
But there is a happy ending to this story. 	1
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m." 	1
So you can have -- and you can do it in a very small space in fact. 	1
This is a climb called the Naked Edge, in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder. 	1
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in coral reefs all over the world. 	1
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth. 	1
There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line. 	1
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play. 	1
He had high leather boots, jodhpurs, an old leather jacket, a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles -- and, inevitably, a white scarf, to flow in the wind. 	1
I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines -- all kinds of things. 	1
When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back. 	1
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns. 	1
Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November 4th? 	1
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you. 	1
But the sound we are greeted with, as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light, recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. 	1
The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. 	1
Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas, whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip, whether it's a new design. 	1
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all. 	1
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation. 	1
My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers, because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids. 	1
So, basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me. 	1
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans. 	1
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians, trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.  So, you can just imagine -- right. 	1
But when they got older, when the time comes for them to start think about getting married, that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture. 	1
And our Centers for Disease Control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic. 	1
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with, you had a weakened immune system, you lived in poverty in India or Africa, your likelihood of dying was far greater. 	1
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world. 	1
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study, and they analyzed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. 	1
One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly -- doubling by about 2030. 	1
And I think there is nobody else who has expressed better, to me, the idea that food, in the end, in our own tradition, is something holy. 	1
There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals, but --  they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons. 	1
Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance. 	1
And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads. 	1
Then, Uganda started to turn back, whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed, and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency. 	1
And you'll find Madagascar, and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. 	1
You know, I don't know how many of those you read, but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write. 	1
You have two medications you didn't try out yet. 	1
But Barack reminded us on that day, all of us in that room, that we all know what our world should look like. 	1
I was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia. 	1
This aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs. 	1
The words on the card describe what will happen inside. 	1
The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper, a million times smaller, a thousand times more powerful. 	1
That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since I was a student. 	1
The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June. 	1
Is that you were the better man, in the end; You were the better man, My friend. 	1
And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you. 	1
The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks, or interactions, for every one negative. 	1
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. 	1
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station, for 16 months, where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. 	1
Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation, from what I would call a biocidal species, one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time. 	1
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you, just please stop protesting in public." 	1
So something like a prostatectomy -- the prostate is small, and it's in one spot, and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot. 	1
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade, and which can generate a lot of jobs, and which is, in any case, a sensible sector to expand, post-conflict, and that is the construction sector. 	1
successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor. 	1
What is raw? The raw, I would say is the naked experience, untouched by luxury, untouched by expensive materials, untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture. 	1
And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench. 	1
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during 1975 and 1979. 	1
In terms of proliferation, nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity. 	1
In the studio we do a lot of experiments. 	1
And so, if you have that gene, and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation, this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster. 	1
Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan. We're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything. 	1
You'd think that person might have made a lot of money, achieved renown in some field. 	1
So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day, or her own day, which I think artists are obliged to do, is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have. 	1
A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this. 	1
How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences, not necessarily utilitarian ones. 	1
David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism. 	1
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash. 	1
 And if you've got a scientific problem like that, you can't solve it by holding a head count, and saying, "More of us say yes than say no." 	1
 Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said, "At my age, I don't even buy green bananas." 	1
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things, can get in the way, can make us pull back, can shut down our ability, and our interest in trying to explore new ideas. 	1
So there is sweat dripping off my head, because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position. 	1
But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this. 	1
Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. 	1
They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef, and they're using CO2 as a building block in cement, in concrete. 	1
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it. 	1
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book. 	1
You don't see a lot of it, but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on, what it means is paying people adequately and fairly, absolutely -- getting the issue of money off the table, and then giving people lots of autonomy. 	1
So that when you walk in or you come in from home, if you carry a purse, it works in your purse. 	1
When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this: Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting. 	1
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud. 	1
We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph, the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be. 	1
And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? 	1
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students, the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people, as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. 	1
And the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that. 	1
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million. 	1
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks, and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile, but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. 	1
Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block, it would be equivalent to how large that block was. 	1
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end. 	1
Narrator : We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally. 	1
And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people. 	1
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial, but studying the jury. 	1
The European Union, which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization, transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history, eventually comprising some 500 million people. 	1
The design process was really tough, almost like a struggle for survival, but gradually an idea evolved: this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city, sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome, but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside, with the library. 	1
But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea. 	1
You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest. 	1
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash. 	1
 No. I think the actual answer is that once you reframe it, once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day, but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished, you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on Craigslist represents. 	1
So the more you block it, the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game. 	1
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school, so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education. 	1
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people. 	1
Siberia most of you probably think of as a cold, desolate, unlivable place. 	1
The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. 	1
And later a black hole was formed in a binary system, which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. 	1
And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. 	1
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. 	1
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. 	1
But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African. 	1
And yet you don't put a letter after that first "T." 	1
What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion. 	1
And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot, and throw up, and that's honey. 	1
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan. 	1
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley. 	1
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago. 	1
So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future. 	1
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence. 	1
But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns, the note is going to be off. 	1
So we can describe the communication between the neurons. 	1
Try and listen to the other one.  We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input, which is why noise like this --  -- is extremely damaging for productivity. 	1
There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets. Right? 	1
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals, wash them, and in the course of this, obviously picking them up they injure themselves. 	1
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that. 	1
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course. 	1
Would it give this block of limestone new properties? 	1
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris, trying to explain his theory. 	1
If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served. 	1
And they have a fight and an argument because -- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." -- not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages. 	1
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them" to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like. 	1
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us: we are responsible for that, and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. 	1
In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something: that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money, but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise. 	1
Art can go through where other things can't. 	1
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development, the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school, and to aspire to work a job 	1
You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy, or problem of libido. 	1
And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer. 	1
And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy, and Japan was starting to catch up. 	1
When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph. 	1
Japan did it like this, until full catch up, and then they follow with the other high-income economies. 	1
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody? 	1
We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener. 	1
And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria, which you'll never have to pay again, one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars. 	1
I just think we're not seeing, at the moment, the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems. 	1
If you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed, A, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts, B, that there was short-range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract; it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now, and if you could then find a financing mechanism by our inability to deal with climate change over many, many years and decades 	1
So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume. 	1
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this. 	1
But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ... 	1
When her mother fell sick she said, "Sunitha, you have so much of contacts. 	1
He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world." 	1
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic, which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation. 	1
But then I began to think of other things. 	1
Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family. 	1
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation. 	1
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ Everything will be all right ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ The Arab world. 	1
So, in the end, I took a decision that, in retrospect, did change my life. 	1
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship, to monitor their relationship with their clientele. 	1
And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region. 	1
One is Education Access for All, setting up schools in small-town India. 	1
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. 	1
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s. 	1
And as long as we fight horizontally, against life, against the winds, against what's happening to us, life is a nightmare. 	1
And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately in order to slow down." 	1
The goal is to take off, end of this year for the first test, but mainly next year, spring or summer, take off, on our own power, without additional help, without being towed, climb to 9,000 meters altitude. 	1
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car, you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works. 	1
This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system, and try to hang on to what's there, make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean, and of course, having a good time too. 	1
During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action. 	1
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials. 	1
Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger, and that is something we're working on right now at the institute. 	1
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right? 	1
I'll go through the three basic configurations. 	1
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell, the oppression of these cells, the reinterpretation of these cells, the undermining of these cells, getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing, eradicating, destroying, reducing these cells, basically began the process of killing off the girl cell, 	1
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. 	1
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. 	1
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan, you turn to a person next to you and say, "Excuse me, what is the name of this street?" 	1
This is a battle we all fight every day, along with trying to get to the gym. 	1
You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly, but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time. 	1
So, I think it's as low-cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things. 	1
And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease, but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer in over 50 years hasn't changed. 	1
In health care today, we spend most of the dollars -- in terms of treating disease -- most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life. 	1
TS: So here are the -- JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here. 	1
One is the large global economy, the large globalized economy, and the other one is the small, and very limited, capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern, to shape, this economy. 	1
And I think corruption, and the fight against corruption, and the impact of corruption, is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance. 	1
JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?" 	1
It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street. 	1
I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America." 	1
Couldn't actually turn back very much, because if you were king a thousand years ago, while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country, there wasn't much you were in charge of. 	1
You could fight for your country, you could die for your country, you could serve in your country's civil service, but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now. 	1
And with that entire wealth of England, King Henry could not buy any antibiotics, he could not buy refrigeration, he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles. 	1
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said, "Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. 	1
Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why Johnny turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming? 	1
A free society requires red lights and green lights, otherwise it soon descends into gridlock. 	1
I had no clue what she was talking about, but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again Thanks to a really boring lecture, I started caricaturing my teachers in school. 	1
Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream. 	1
We all live our lives because we want to achieve something, correct? 	1
A couple of years later -- so I get really excited about these things -- about a couple of years later, there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada. 	1
So what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce, maybe, what happened to the skier. 	1
And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time, down to the tenths of a microsecond, that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately, or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk, where they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right? 	1
And that switchover, when we had the larger number of older people on the planet, for the first time than younger people. 	1
And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this. Right? 	1
Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English, I work for Intel, I make a good salary, I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries -- it's an area of research that I work on. 	1
Well think of how we talk about food: I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. 	1
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that while we may not like this, we might think of this as "wrong" in Boston or Palo Alto, who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags? 	1
We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters  to cover the costs. 	1
And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this, it's that there are also -- in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved -- there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others. 	1
KB: James and our country director in Ghana, Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people, from the fishing industry, for enslaving children. 	1
Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. 	1
In many ways, our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. 	1
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share. 	1
And they shipped him to Germany and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed. 	1
So, think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel, but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub; so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid. 	1
In this case it's very intuitive; this student, probably his first time using it, doing very complex manipulation tasks, picking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that. Very intuitive. 	1
And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses. 	1
Well, I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, "The Holocaust teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man, when he loses his moral compass and his reason." 	1
Right after I completed my Ph.D., I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration. 	1
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals; one, the enzyme, he called luciferase; the substrate, he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer. 	1
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure. 	1
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible, say yes -- a thousand times, yes -- and please turn out the lights. 	1
Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face? 	1
Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment -- I must tell you that I am an actor. 	1
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say, I just paid a lot of money for that reading. 	1
So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. 	1
And for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate, we've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica, and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things in R &amp; D and education, lots of other areas. 	1
This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here. 	1
Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe? 	1
Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns, in fractals and so on, where the structure is something that's kind of tree-like, and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on. 	1
And there's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence, not so much in thinking about simplicity. 	1
So, what I think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity, which doesn't cover Brancusi, it doesn't answer the question of why Mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh, and certainly doesn't address the question of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach. 	1
In the long term, people who got the free bed nets, one year later, were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars. 	1
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do, what is the best way to achieve my goals? 	1
And I cut it into smaller questions, and I have the answer to these smaller questions. 	1
Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions? 	1
We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that. 	1
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. 	1
I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. 	1
It's a little hard to understand that, because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish. 	1
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge, and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global, coastal ocean. 	1
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. 	1
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- "What is a scalable model?" -- as if the need of a community, which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places, has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale. 	1
And the daughter's husband, he also was sick from his wife's exhaustion. 	1
There's a middle and an edge to this network, and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges. 	1
If you look here at the dots, compare node B in the upper left to node D in the far right; B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him. 	1
And, finally, compare nodes C and D: C and D both have six friends. 	1
NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas, usually. 	1
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. 	1
"Human males and females develop a special bond, and when they're much older, much, much older than you, and they have a very special feeling, then they can be naked together." 	1
But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here, Emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes. 	1
So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs, the other one is out there foraging, and the longer they have to stay gone, the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back. 	1
You take about eight or so carbon atoms, about 20 hydrogen atoms, you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid: very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels. 	1
Well, a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear, for starters. 	1
What is the future of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy? 	1
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often, it's not. 	1
We think of it as maybe too silly, too unnecessary. 	1
Every season, these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love. 	1
Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society? 	1
Notice these other, smaller protuberances. 	1
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely. 	1
Here's a logistics system, a small piece of one that we're currently building. 	1
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture, there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically. 	1
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses, human things, like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net. 	1
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast of North America, United States and Canada, and they have to deal with all these urban ills. 	1
CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. 	1
But I think to set the scene, I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED, but it is a bit of a mess. 	1
Because, if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors, it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success might actually lie somewhere else, in small pieces of tactical activity. 	1
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases, very, very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects, and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers, can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all. 	1
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. 	1
So if you add these two together, alone, you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy. 	1
If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol, you'd actually increase the death rate slightly. 	1
And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities. 	1
If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world, and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity, the additional death rates due to this averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. 	1
And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with. 	1
And now, if you go back to looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both, and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing, but it's still pretty small. 	1
In every case, they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. 	1
Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is, and we can move toward zero weapons left, once we know all that. 	1
I'm now supporting Stewart's position, softly, from a risk-management standpoint, agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident, which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. 	1
 These are played mainly in small rooms. 	1
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music, whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever. 	1
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control. 	1
And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists, they go away. 	1
There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales. 	1
But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector. 	1
And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins -- when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside. 	1
Then I would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge. 	1
Allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck. 	1
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification. 	1
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds, who are thinking these really big-picture, world-changing, life-changing ideas and technologies. 	1
So if you look, as I did, through this tour, and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions, look at the recipes that they come up with for learning, they look nothing like school. 	1
to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow, and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead -- a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century. 	1
Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate." 	1
Suburban expansion to cheap land, for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream. 	1
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree. 	1
We see the base of the food chain, the plankton, the small things, and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid, and on so up this diagram. 	1
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan, and I'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which I believe they shouldn't. 	1
It's an ocean planet, and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species, but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected. 	1
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. 	1
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands. 	1
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. 	1
When it breaks up, it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria. 	1
There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them. 	1
So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea, put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao." 	1
But if what you're looking for is serendipity, if you want to stumble onto something that you didn't know you needed, our main philosophy is to look to our social networks, to look for our friends. 	1
You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you, who have similar interests. 	1
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. 	1
And please bear with me: I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. 	1
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews, the people around, who were interviewed as well, refer to that behavior as Talibanization. 	1
Let's think of life as that entire planet because, in a sense, it is. 	1
It will be the size of a single, small atom. 	1
Instead of making better choices, we become overwhelmed by choice, sometimes even afraid of it. 	1
Look at this diagram, which is showing warm waters in red, cool waters in blue, and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green, is the growth of vegetation, and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation. 	1
So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. 	1
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator. 	1
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans, to actually buy different pieces of food. 	1
Well, you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other. 	1
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. 	1
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't, or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable? 	1
So it's the demand that brings them to the table. 	1
For instance, in the last half-century, more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the 20th century. 	1
 So what would some of the specific challenges look like? 	1
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops. 	1
And if you're happy with that, fantastic. 	1
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map, and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended. 	1
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. 	1
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. 	1
And then we're starting to create a happy planet. 	1
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. 	1
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal. 	1
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? 	1
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away, and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years. 	1
I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant. 	1
  Now, rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation, I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation, a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century. 	1
There's not a lot of science behind that one either. 	1
But to answer that question, to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide, you have to know something about all of these other agents of change. 	1
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica, just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. 	1
So, what we do: we've merged a lot of different data sets. 	1
I mean, today, one person speaking can be seen by millions, shedding bright light on potent ideas, creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case, intense desire to laugh. 	1
And you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life -- and I know this is true of some of you -- if you were drinking all day, and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life, you would have better ideas. 	1
This is what your office should look like, is part of my message here. 	1
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do, and I expect them to follow my guidance -- because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard -- but the reality is, if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex. 	1
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain. 	1
I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small, and propels us to the world of the far future. 	1
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also. 	1
 So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms? 	1
Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre, where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits, but they're not really going away. 	1
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water. 	1
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. 	1
They had low child mortality and small families. 	1
They are a network of small computing machines, working in networks. 	1
And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it. 	1
I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network, a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. 	1
And as I look forward to what is next, it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. 	1
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. 	1
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues, a lot of nervous tissues, which penetrate actually the muscle -- penetrate the submucosa, where you have all the elements for the immune system. 	1
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. 	1
I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. 	1
To understand power diffusion put this in your mind: computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century. 	1
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis, many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. 	1
Secondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce. 	1
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. 	1
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes, all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines, and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better. 	1
And after the close of the election, you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. 	1
It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. 	1
Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. 	1
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies, but don't know how to fix it. 	1
So if you go through lots of examples, you can get the answer, you can understand how the basics of the system work better. 	1
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. 	1
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. 	1
And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. 	1
I grew up in a very small village in Canada, and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. 	1
Let me tell you what I've come up with. 	1
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes. 	1
If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight, you can take it back. 	1
And he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap, looking for header material, which is the board that goes over a door, thinking he'd impress his boss -- that's how we taught him to do it. 	1
It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. 	1
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. 	1
You get a new disease that can be deadly. 	1
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world. 	1
This is about tough policing, equal policing. 	1
So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes. 	1
They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. 	1
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning. 	1
In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. 	1
Get out of the airplane, it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. 	1
And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. 	1
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home," meant that my payday -- or someone else's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. 	1
More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent, uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with. 	1
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months, and not only that, but release every day to go to work. 	1
He was married, he had a third kid on the way, he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back, and recurrent nightmares, and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. 	1
And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes. 	1
Radiologists classify breast density based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. 	1
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. 	1
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. 	1
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India. 	1
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about." 	1
So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls, and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. 	1
Where we started: my colleagues -- Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself -- we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming, what do they say about it. 	1
This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. 	1
If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin, and I can feel the bone structure inside. 	1
And the epidemiologists here will tell you, that's half the number of people who get the disease So if you go to 23andMe, or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link. 	1
And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. 	1
There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. 	1
That's easier for them to find out than who you are. 	1
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. 	1
I can't wait to find out what it looks like. 	1
They are free from all of these modern ailments. 	1
Without getting a little too extreme about this, imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene, more healthy, burn off stress -- where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore, where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again. 	1
And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much. 	1
They put it into worm recomposting systems, which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon, which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants. 	1
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that, we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. 	1
The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. 	1
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. 	1
He saw that first glint of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. 	1
But mostly what you need to know, to find out if you're sick, is not your predispositions, but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. 	1
There are a lot of people who are frustrated." 	1
In fact, there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge. 	1
We then tease the cells apart, we grow the cells outside the body. 	1
And they're saying, "Hey, this is nice, but --" Like that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said, "I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic." 	1
And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data, to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set, trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. 	1
And then I went on to reflect, "Isn't it amazing, this entire database, all these recordings, I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" -- who arrived two years later -- "and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never, with your biological memory, possibly remember the way you can now?" 	1
This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- captured on film. 	1
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. 	1
So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs -- all look like velociraptors, all named after Jane Austen characters. 	1
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like. 	1
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience. 	1
They look like they're frozen in some embrace. 	1
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine, where people are put in the sun to get better. 	1
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting. 	1
And finally, I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater. 	1
Your voice is small, but don't ever stop singing. 	1
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired. 	1
But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more. 	1
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command, convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium. 	1
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking." 	1
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. 	1
♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫ ♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫ ♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it ♫ ♫ very much longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ 	1
We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa, but then you see humans migrating into new environments, into desert lands, into jungles, into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia -- tough, tough environment -- into the Americas, into Australasia. 	1
And then from about 500 years ago, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the Internet, until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals. 	1
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else, apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ... 	1
I have much to make me happy and relieved. 	1
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota, I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. 	1
And you watch the news, you pay attention, you read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends, and you read the newspapers from around the world. 	1
And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch, one tiny inch, then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life. 	1
 Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right? 	1
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war, so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right, conditional good, or not right. 	1
If you're a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them, I put in a letter. 	1
And so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually, at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter, let's ask -- there's a parent over there." 	1
Each mirror, there are four of them, is made of a single piece of glass, a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic, that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [to] imagine a city like Paris, with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower, if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy, you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high. 	1
And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. 	1
So an example might be, if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common, there were a lot of fears about it. 	1
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems. 	1
But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy. 	1
It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats. 	1
And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint. 	1
  And when you get a very small one --  This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. 	1
So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this. 	1
But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire. 	1
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, we could actually imagine growing consumable products. 	1
In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures, he emphasized this puzzle: Why did the early universe have such a small entropy? 	1
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations. 	1
So once you have these attributes of this material, then you can do a lot of things. 	1
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light, and so we've made optical fibers. 	1
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle, we do microneedle arrays. 	1
Being Dick, he, of course, wanted to check this. 	1
Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing. 	1
So he sat down -- and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil -- and he tried to write down, and did write down, the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. 	1
Just think of the proton as an assemblage of little particles -- a swarm of little particles." 	1
Now unlike a human-designed computer, where there's a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work, because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands. 	1
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. 	1
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. 	1
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. 	1
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish. 	1
I think there's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil -- something we can all relate to, this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing. 	1
And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data, we have an opportunity, and maybe even an obligation, to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories Thanks a lot. 	1
And this is the reason: in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade, on opposite sides of the globe, there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. 	1
And this is because disease eradication, it's still the venture capital of public health. 	1
The brutal truth is, if we don't have the will or the skill, or even the money that we need to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world, with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine, then pretty soon, more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year. 	1
In 1950, Turkey had the first free and fair elections, which ended the more autocratic secular regime, which was the beginning of Turkey. 	1
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop. 	1
So think of it as a monitor for the blind. 	1
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S., any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny, tiny influence on your overall well-being. 	1
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this. 	1
We have found a lot of evidence from when they were juveniles to when they were adults. 	1
So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years, when we've started to apply this cloud-based information, when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done. 	1
I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that. 	1
Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites. 	1
But the medium is lossy -- it's subject to a lot of noise and interference. 	1
So Bell employed an engineer to study those noises, to try and find out where they came from, with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony. 	1
Many people in Mexico are afraid today. 	1
In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together. 	1
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI, I thought, well, let's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin. 	1
Up to 30 percent of the population have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body. 	1
And the following morning, my mother came to explain that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room, that I'd been working in film and television and that I had been in a crash and that, yes, I was married, but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash. 	1
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion. 	1
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation-states. 	1
However, if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan, and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today, you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. 	1
So the symptoms of the complex are, no matter how complicated the problem, you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution. 	1
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor, but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists. 	1
And so along with changing who worked there, you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into, in particular with women, and it has to do with outside image, dress, the veiled woman. 	1
And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure. 	1
So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -- throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -- all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. 	1
Now any physiological variable you can think of, any life history event you can think of, if you plot it this way, looks like this. 	1
I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art. 	1
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes. 	1
Food can be there and people can't buy it. 	1
And I think as that happens, it's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating and technology's ability to make sense of it all. 	1
And if you do the energy budget, the data transmission comes for free -- highly energy efficient. 	1
And you can see that, in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language, not having language would be a like a bird without wings. 	1
Humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors, where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye: microorganisms. 	1
And today, architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us. 	1
It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for, because I know this struggle isn't my own. 	1
So from studying these genomes of extinct humans, we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of Africa. 	1
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future. 	1
First of all, worse nutrition, maybe shorter life spans. 	1
And my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976, that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters, but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus. 	1
So what we're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules. 	1
And so with this Lego kit, we have the diversity required for complex information storage without DNA. 	1
And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. 	1
And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial, because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals. 	1
And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. 	1
So first: the way in which this woman was treated, in as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting. 	1
So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence. 	1
He's now free again, But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt. 	1
Now there's only a small part of the population, which remains unaffected. 	1
This disease appears first as tumors, usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. 	1
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. 	1
And if you're squeamish, please look away now. 	1
They were taking 3,000 children, they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills, six of them a day, and then a year later, they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn't had the pills. 	1
But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong. 	1
How can we explain this strange phenomenon? 	1
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making, but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life. 	1
I know it because people come up to me, like colleagues, and say, "Chris, you have a strange career." 	1
And what you might get -- and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to, you throw away. 	1
And I'm really happy that no photo survives of the three of us anywhere close together. 	1
So that inspired me to think about, well, what if I try to use this idea in order, not to detect random texts from texts with meaning, but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. 	1
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff. 	1
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling. 	1
And I remember at the beginning of my career, again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras, I would be going completely insane on the podium, trying to engender a small scale crescendo really, just a little upsurge in volume. 	1
from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said, "Conducting, Charles, is like holding a small bird in your hand. 	1
  CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today, so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are. 	1
Now one day in 1772, the prince decreed that the musicians' families, the orchestral musicians' families, were no longer welcome in the castle. 	1
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. 	1
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men. 	1
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win." 	1
We're trying to heat up and all that is trying to get out through the window. 	1
And it takes all the infrared available at night, converts it into an electron in the space of two small films, and is enabling you to play an image which you can see through. 	1
You have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts. And it's just too hard to use now and for my patients today. 	1
His hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat, so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated, if you would, his skin. 	1
So it'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made. 	1
And none of those problems could I have dealt with, but I have a really bright research team. 	1
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world. 	1
We think the things we make can solve our problems, but our problems are much more complex than that. 	1
And as was typical with the Norden bombsight, the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft. 	1
And so, please consider this a work in progress, but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma, about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer, called BRD4, and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, called JQ1, which we affectionately named for Jun Qi, the chemist that made this molecule. 	1
 So I spent a lot of time in this building. 	1
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd. 	1
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed. 	1
And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world, which has a lot of problems. 	1
And finally, I want to remind you, when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks, the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic. 	1
If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism -- we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate, and if we coupled these now to inheritable information, we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve. 	1
You can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places. 	1
Now what do those differences look like? 	1
I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app. 	1
So it suggests that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans, maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once. 	1
So what I'm going to do and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy, you can imagine what you'd like to see. 	1
We just think of good weather and bad weather. 	1
It's that I sat there and I thought, "Make it go away. Make it go away. 	1
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets. 	1
Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. 	1
And let me tell you right now, it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech. 	1
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot, and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider, what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. 	1
You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again, so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's, AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY. 	1
Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis, that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers, you can see that there's a lot of variation, and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk, is the strongest of these fibers. 	1
And the strength, extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response, have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications, for example, as a component of artificial tendons, for serving as guides to regrow nerves, and for scaffolds for tissue growth. 	1
I won't go into this very much, but our technology, besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence, we can also use the same smart three-part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively. 	1
If more companies did this, and if more sectors engaged this as sectors, you could have analysts, business analysts, and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. 	1
And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this.  BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine, Chris Jones. This is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas, they're hard to understand. 	1
So after we do that, we put it into a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed, some spices, and we roll it, and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna. 	1
So developing nations and first-world nations, imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them, food miles would basically turn into food feet. 	1
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious. 	1
Well resisting temptation is hard, as the 19th century English economist Nassau William Senior said, "To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power, or to seek distant rather than immediate results, are among the most painful exertions of the human will." 	1
So my coauthors and I have used computers, the greatest tool of our time, to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future. 	1
However, had you ended up on the very bottom, it might have given you a slight sense of dread and/or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement. 	1
He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job. 	1
This potential is not for the lucky few. 	1
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars, and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them. 	1
My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power, Western institutions and Western values. 	1
So I started asking all my friends, please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words. 	1
However, anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. 	1
So any user can come in here and click on "lung function report" and it'll take them to this report that I created. 	1
It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts. 	1
You answer a lot of questions, and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality. 	1
And we can take out the physical product, and ready to use, or to, perhaps, assemble into something else. 	1
If you think about it, this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it? 	1
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations, emails, relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags, we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place: ourselves. 	1
I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves. 	1
The reason we can say that, though, is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. 	1
And they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer. 	1
 Now, that was cheating, because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister, but Amy the special unicorn. 	1
And in my research and my teaching, I found that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or physics, but on the competition, the workload, the hassles, stresses, complaints. 	1
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. 	1
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles. 	1
They generally seem to think, "Well, why would we care what's happened with the police? 	1
The people you're going to be shooting at aren't going to be able to get out of the way. 	1
Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one. 	1
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing, which means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger. 	1
That was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me, to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life, a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say, "You've been an important person in my life," was a moment that I didn't even remember. 	1
But still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce. 	1
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. 	1
One percent check the box. The rest do nothing. 	1
We hate losing stuff, even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk. 	1
They take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more -- take a little bit of the increase and put it in a 401 plan. 	1
In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth, and much of it we don't know about. 	1
And I want to start with a bit on technology, because, of course, this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology. 	1
Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with, as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs. 	1
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do. 	1
And the other way around, if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one, then the robot pitches forward. 	1
The smaller you make it, the more quickly you can turn. 	1
So let me show you some examples of what these minimum-snap trajectories look like. 	1
 So once you know how to fly in formation, you can actually pick up objects cooperatively. 	1
And when that happens, the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings. 	1
He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition. 	1
And so when a green interacts with a blue, you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller. 	1
I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell." 	1
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar. 	1
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote. 	1
You cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an MCF. 	1
CA: One of the questions from the audience is, with fracking and the natural gas process, what about the problem of methane leaking from that, methane being a worse global warming gas than CO2? 	1
We often can't think of a young woman who has heart disease. 	1
And I have one small idea, and one big idea about what could happen. 	1
The OED defines spectrum as "The entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part." 	1
But David's young and he's smart and he wants a Ph.D., and he proceeds to build --  He proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry. 	1
And on that first flight we got more data than in all U-2 missions combined. 	1
From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature's storms. 	1
And this was at the beginning of elections. 	1
This is one place where women were never -- even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men. 	1
There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome. 	1
All those years, all those books, he never got tired of it. 	1
One of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of Soviet biological weapons testing. 	1
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture. 	1
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon, things we want to protect. 	1
Now, having this conversation has been really hard, and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy, to increase the collaboration. 	1
Because in region after region, again and again, parents have wanted to have smaller families. 	1
One of the leading causes of economic growth across that region was this cultural trend towards smaller families. 	1
Sometimes it's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer the next person that can help you answer it. 	1
Finally, in part three, I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation, which will pull all the pieces of the story together. 	1
And we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing. 	1
Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry. 	1
This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy insecurity, energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe. 	1
The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box. 	1
What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge, but go through a lane that's an express lane? 	1
The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand, and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple, when, in actuality, women are complicated, women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy, but because people are crazy, and women happen to be people.  So the flaws are the key. 	1
Ha ha.  If you use that, you can get away with anything. 	1
I started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey, and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs and far larger brains. 	1
Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page. 	1
In fact, there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitos. 	1
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000. 	1
So while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody's pale and thin and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays, you think of a lot of things. 	1
We see them come up with more interesting, and just more, ideas so they can choose from better ideas. 	1
Well let me tell you, in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year, because the Arab Spring is still spreading, the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else? 	1
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. 	1
So basically we had automobiles, but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. 	1
So please join me for a minute of silence. 	1
 I've been trying inside I know that I'm in trouble But every time it gets me    And I've been trying to be the one that you believe in And you're the one that I want to be so saucy And you're the one I want to [unclear], baby And you can do anything as long as you don't get hurt along the way back  If I survive, I'm going to tell you what is wrong 	1
So thanks to this student, who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true, this project taught me an important lesson about life, which is to always question assumptions. 	1
And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs, and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation. 	1
It's as if we've all got 125 light bulbs on all the time, 125 kilowatt-hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the U.K. So there's 40 light bulbs' worth for transport, 40 light bulbs' worth for heating, and 40 light bulbs' worth for making electricity, and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish. 	1
They all have a small power per unit area, and we have to live with that fact. 	1
Well, the options are, I'd say, these three: power renewables, and recognizing that they need to be close to country-sized; other people's renewables, so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left-hand side of the diagram and say, "Uh, we don't want renewables in our backyard, but, um, please could we put them in yours instead?" 	1
It got in worse condition in the 20th century after Heiberg saw it. 	1
So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon. 	1
And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses, and it would be a great benefit to everybody. 	1
So while economic development made a few people rich, it left many more worse off. 	1
So right before the revolution we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives, but not only that, they thought their future would be no better. 	1
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States, except that with the technologies that are coming online today, today's corrections, deletions, augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child's play. 	1
To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation, because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information. 	1
This is the letter SHeen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh." 	1
And we actually have a bit of a question here, because if there are so many different causes of autism, how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome? Because people like myself, when we walk into a playroom, we recognize a child as having autism. 	1
We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. 	1
They tend to sensationalize, and they lack context. 	1
We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on. 	1
And from that moment, I knew the given was that accident; I had no option but to make up this new life without walking. 	1
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young. 	1
I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was -- gay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex. 	1
The lawyers might file a clemency petition, they might initiate even more complex litigation, or they might not do anything at all. 	1
We could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes, and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them. 	1
We also refer to subclinical conditions. 	1
It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs, and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support. 	1
The two strategies of research, original research, can be stated as follows, in the final principle I'm going to offer you: For every problem in a given discipline of science, there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution. 	1
So, we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use, so that our students could just build things that worked, but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. 	1
One was sick and the other one was healthy, so he had to make sure they ate the proper food. 	1
MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed. 	1
I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain. 	1
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives. 	1
Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. 	1
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. 	1
So —  Thank you very much.  And so that's the beginning of Protei, and that's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it, and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat. 	1
This is low speed, low wind speed, and the maneuverability is very increased, and here I'm going to do a small jibe, and look at the position of the sail. 	1
So, I wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an industrial level, so we made a large boat with a large sail, and with a very light hull, inflatable, very small footprint, so we have a very big size and power ratio. 	1
It means that everybody is free to use, modify and distribute, and in exchange we only ask for two things: The name is credited -- the name of the project -- and also the people who make improvement, they share back with the community. 	1
It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition. 	1
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform, we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. 	1
In contrast, theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing, things where the driver is thinking quite a bit. 	1
Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn directions, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you what block you were on, let alone what street. 	1
So, Einstein said that "For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope." 	1
In each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004, 250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005, 85,000 dead, the Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead, more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry — in all of these instances, we see partnerships between international actors, interagency, private-public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster. 	1
Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas, and I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea. 	1
We have people who have, for example, taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine, so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more, you can point and discover the information. 	1
Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D. 	1
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery, and a bunch of small speakers. 	1
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions, what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience? 	1
If we could free ourselves from our education? 	1
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved into this. 	1
And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece, of a painting when there's a lack of resolution. 	1
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" -- we don't know if she's happy or sad. 	1
"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked. 	1
And later this year, the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years. 	1
So, when some very political, exciting moments happened, you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened. 	1
Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat]. 	1
There is not only in China, but also in the United States there are some very small, cute but bad cats. 	1
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time. 	1
I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa. 	1
That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere. 	1
The realities of my community are simple. They look like this. 	1
So we had to come up with a different solution. 	1
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower, except that like almost all whistle-blowers, he wasn't a crank at all, he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served. 	1
He's been christened the voice of a generation, and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate, but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs. 	1
Enough of all that.  And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden, look, let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates: a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives; a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves; and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support. 	1
So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year, and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary. 	1
Anybody that's selling their excess eggs at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors, we've stuck on there. We started with four, and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds, 	1
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it. 	1
And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere, because it works and it's effective. 	1
 Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. 	1
I said, "Could I come and interview you in prison, to find out it you're psychopaths?" 	1
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked, he said, "I think I know how to write a version control system for free people." 	1
For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout, and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting. 	1
It turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment. 	1
Festivals promote diversity, they bring neighbors into dialogue, they increase creativity, they offer opportunities for civic pride, they improve our general psychological well-being. 	1
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money, it won't satisfy me. 	1
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying "QC," or quality control. 	1
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000."  Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much." 	1
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth, that things over time were getting better? 	1
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling. 	1
It might surprise some of you here, as it did me, when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world, including the poorest countries of the world. 	1
We need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less-trained individuals. 	1
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas, but do not make a flower arrangement without a license, because that will land you in jail. 	1
That's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly. 	1
So what's interesting is, then if you begin to add new things to it, like autonomy, you get out of the car, you park at your destination, you pat it on the butt, it goes and it parks itself, it charges itself, and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles in a given area as conventional cars, and we think this is the future. 	1
OK, so if we have a conventional building, we have a fixed envelope, maybe we can put in 14 units. 	1
But in the end, the main thing we need to focus on are people. 	1
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request —  — but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said, "Yes, I will." 	1
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you the artist's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay somewhere in the world, and we have in the background in this image, the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the CO2, but when you do the economics of this system, you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work. 	1
But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us. 	1
One of the very lucky things, when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team, so I put my hands up right away, instinctively. 	1
Thank you.   Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you.  	1
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible. 	1
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes. 	1
So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language, or other people's body language, on judgments. 	1
So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks. 	1
They're being judged also, and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback, so they look like this. 	1
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.  But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that. 	1
This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization. 	1
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections, connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way, by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter, like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions. 	1
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of eBay for errands existed. 	1
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting, where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past. 	1
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing, and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal, over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs. 	1
Now actually, in 1993, the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study, published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community, in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance." 	1
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse. 	1
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small. 	1
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing. 	1
Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria, it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding. 	1
However, if I use as an example a family of five going on holiday, if you can imagine this, all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong, what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses. 	1
They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more. 	1
Here we go.  This little baby has a lot of horsepower. 	1
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you. 	1
And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is, how sick do we get? Is it something that kills us? 	1
And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people. 	1
And more importantly, we're able to gather information about our choices, because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies, our genomes, our choices and our environment. 	1
I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid. 	1
Please give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork. 	1
We've mentioned the health, but it needs consumers to buy into it. 	1
I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point, but —  — TED, for health and safety reasons, have told me I've got to do a countdown, so I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist, sort of a health and safety terrorist, and I —  — I've got to count 3, 2, 1, and it's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be, 	1
What happens if that bomb went off because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction? 	1
And perception underpins everything we think, we know, we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear, falling in love, everything begins with perception. 	1
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. 	1
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world, and in all cases except one, where a group actually underestimated the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency towards overestimation, and so I thought it important to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars. 	1
But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data. 	1
So I've told you a bit about what I did into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing. 	1
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request, to ask your public body a question, so it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests, so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question, for example, how many police officers have a criminal record? 	1
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us, or heights, but rather things that might poison us, or give us disease and make us sick. 	1
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look, I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted, things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh. 	1
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages."  Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary, and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite. 	1
Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. 	1
They communicate their delight to their children, who respond with smiles, and a desire to achieve more and to learn more. 	1
Behind each of the million children in institutions, there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova, who only had enough money to feed her baby, and so had to send her older son to the institution; or Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children at home until her husband died, but then she had to go out to work full time, 	1
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now, because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites, and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact. 	1
and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement —  — it created a lot of controversy.  So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients. 	1
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me, that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually, was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of, you know, 	1
Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night. 	1
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife. 	1
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it? 	1
Now when you're talking about trying to travel long distances on rough terrain, I immediately thought of a mountain bike, and a mountain bike's good at doing this because it has a gear train, and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed. 	1
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster. 	1
So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems. 	1
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed. 	1
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc. 	1
I mean, you have the typical European cities, with a dense urban core, good public transportation mostly, not a lot of road capacity. 	1
And where did they go? If we can understand this, then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this. 	1
And so there's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world. 	1
The good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need we already have, and we are very good at giving: economic assistance, not just money, but expertise, technology, knowhow, private investment, fair terms of trade, medicine, education, technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective, for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient. 	1
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days. 	1
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next, and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies. 	1
And then he's about to become a victim of a vicious smash-and-grab.  And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource. 	1
So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go, and that's a very, very important thing, because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile, you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else, and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line. 	1
And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes, so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted. 	1
And my answer must at once be, it is no use. 	1
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for. 	1
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars, and each driver drives about 80 percent less because they're now paying the full cost, all at once, in real time. 	1
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals, if you're a company, what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation, or 100 people who are in charge of innovation. 	1
And for me, when I think about our future, and all of those problems that seem incredibly large, the scale is impossible, the urgency is there, Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems. 	1
And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation. 	1
Ask for the part of the story that's not being told. 	1
So what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff, don't think of it as the American people fundamentally can't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations. 	1
So the next time you get dengue fever, if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible, you're likely to get worse symptoms, and you're more likely to get the more severe forms, hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. 	1
We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can't get the disease transmission. 	1
The males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go. 	1
Well, in the last 12 years it's become much more apparent that it is. 	1
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week. 	1
Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems. 	1
Let us therefore go to battle stations, not to fight each other, but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids. 	1
I'm expecting the release of a chapter book called "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked." 	1
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries in a lot of developing countries. 	1
A few good things here: This appeared to be more marked in older people. 	1
And eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery. 	1
In order to break down our barriers, we have to learn to talk to people, to demand that people work on translation. 	1
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities, at least one of which is an artist. 	1
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick." 	1
They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes, and in a lot of cases they got it. 	1
So imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction. 	1
And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told, whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal. 	1
That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges 20 years ago. 	1
The paint on the walls did not feed children, nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant, but it gave hope and light, and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things, a different spirit, a different feel to our lives, and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics, we could build a better life for each other and for our country. 	1
I gave you a very small example of how one thing, the use of color, can make change happen. 	1
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. 	1
You know, students are divided up, reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards. 	1
But there's an intriguing solution which is coming To explain what this means and what this thing is, please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. 	1
 So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide. 	1
Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner, when my imagination comes back in the picture, and when I can root it in absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire. 	1
That's the beginning of desire, that exploratory need, curiosity, discovery. 	1
 So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door. 	1
So the news came, I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and I couldn't come without the support of the village, because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket. 	1
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers, the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said: "We want a school for boys." 	1
Of course all happy families aren't alike." 	1
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there, downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication, most of which I didn't understand. 	1
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something, you can find out in two minutes? 	1
And they did. And when they did, it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville. 	1
And I don't know about you, but I prefer to dine. 	1
I once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?" 	1
And I got a lot of criticism online, after my Kickstarter went big, for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. 	1
So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. 	1
Think of it in terms of drums of water, each containing 200 liters. 	1
When I was a young man, a young biologist in Africa, I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. 	1
Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals, and humans, over thousands of years, had never been able to deal with nature's complexity. 	1
This was another site where it had been bare and eroding, and at the base of the marked small tree, we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay? 	1
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that. 	1
When I was 19, I wrote, "I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite." 	1
There are a lot of problems with this question. 	1
Some of it will dribble into the right place, but a lot of it will do more harm than good. 	1
Now, in humans we often infer emotional states, as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions. 	1
You try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip, and the ones that win, that you can then put into a living organism. It'll work. 	1
A bit of cloning, you can get them back. 	1
Might we answer that clarion call with science, with reason, with facts, and, dare I say it, emotions? 	1
So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying, "You must understand smart materials now." 	1
What's a drug? A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape, and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact, that particular drug is going to hit its target. 	1
It's a little too complicated to explain right now, but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur. 	1
Those numbers have only gone up, and as United Republic calculated last April, the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was 1,452 percent. 	1
Change the incentives, and the behavior changes, and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice. 	1
But instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again. 	1
You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills, at least he would have some sense of progress. 	1
This was a group within the software company that was put in a different building, and they asked them to innovate, and create the next big product for this company. 	1
So we built a large rotating chamber, and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower, adding energy to the system and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products. 	1
And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions. 	1
I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith. 	1
You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone, and her mom buys her a robot. 	1
By the 19th century, it had become a kind of gentleman's club populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility. 	1
The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members. 	1
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation, but if you look at the budgets of countries, developing and developed, you'll think there's something wrong with the math, because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation, even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year. 	1
It depends, of course, on what scale or what scope you want to think about, but this is an organ of surreal complexity, and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it, whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing 	1
And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled, and I gave him my gift, and he told me I was a guest in his home, and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch. 	1
There were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common, and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago. 	1
So here you really have the blues, and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation, in drive and decision-making, and indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were, those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive. 	1
So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go, "Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech. 	1
And of course, theoretically, it does, and if you look at older texts, then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud. 	1
The amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for 30 years. Thirty years. 	1
I've really tried to solve some big problems: counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism, and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer, but I started thinking about all these problems, and I realized that the really biggest problem we face, what all these other problems come down to, is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons. 	1
You're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion, because that's what I've done most of my life. 	1
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point, but before that I was obsessed with space, and I was really excited about, you know, being an astronaut and designing rockets, which was something that was always exciting to me. 	1
But I think I get to come back to this, because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts. 	1
How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion? 	1
And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us, and we started. We started to plant, and this first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less, and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again. 	1
So there were a lot of teachers who were like, "She's never going to make it. 	1
What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement. 	1
Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley. 	1
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. 	1
And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this. 	1
One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch. 	1
I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters. 	1
And we used to imagine that someday, they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin, and, if they could, they would fly away. 	1
Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives. 	1
I was afraid that they would kill us, and instead they understood, especially when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem that Philip Johnson applied in 1934 when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design, and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals against white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures. 	1
This is also true, by the way, of the word "gender," because a lot of people hear the word "gender" and they think it means "women." 	1
So I went through the very legal process, because at the end of the day, the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not, and that's how I got in there. 	1
So when I look around, I think the day is not too far off at all when we're going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now. 	1
Actually, I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many, many years. 	1
So, again, my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of. 	1
And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution. 	1
We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. 	1
You see, then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country, and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where, maybe, the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country. 	1
That is, abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential, falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas, taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens. 	1
If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential, well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece, and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion. 	1
It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations, but criminal organizations, private enterprise, even powerful individuals. 	1
You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights. 	1
There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming in August 2008, and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market." 	1
So a human encountering the divine, as Muslims believe Muhammad did, to the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact but of wishful fiction, and like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational. 	1
You could see willful blindness Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those, and it also exists on very small scales, in people's families, in people's homes and communities, and particularly in organizations and institutions. 	1
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. 	1
But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right? 	1
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well. 	1
This was very exciting, but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work, because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it, cryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen. 	1
Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success. 	1
Those who expect the future to be better: a whopping 82 percent. 	1
Are you happy with the general direction of the country? 	1
Because if there's anything worse in the field of global public health -- I don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet to die of vaccine-preventable diseases -- diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar. 	1
They think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions, and then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking. 	1
It's like a nostalgic fondness, and they make them think of their youth. 	1
It's like a bit of everyday meditation. 	1
Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes. 	1
It's too complex and difficult to change. 	1
In the oil and mining sector, for example, there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems. 	1
We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change. 	1
Buildings are starting to go up around the world. 	1
And they share 97 percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent, so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world. 	1
And despite their extremely small sizes, they have these incredible properties. 	1
When I began recording in the late '60s, the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly, in the beginning, but later animals like mammals and amphibians. 	1
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of "crony capitalism," political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. 	1
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt. 	1
Because it is a bit of a niche market, and there's not much work going on, especially where I'm from. 	1
So you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps, but you think about Amazon, you look at the trust barometer that I showed you where people are starting to trust businesses, especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments. 	1
And this, indeed, really is tough to say, but a few months later, we realized that we were really feeling like a failure. 	1
It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology. 	1
And my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on, because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design. 	1
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem. 	1
The bus was on fire, and many people were hurt and killed. 	1
We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things. 	1
That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it. 	1
  The poor woman had mistakenly told him "toqborni," and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. 	1
But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up. 	1
We need to think of new kinds of arguments. 	1
This is an iron, you know, for your clothes, to which I added a spraying mechanism, so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent, and your clothes will smell nicer, but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. 	1
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing, but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today. 	1
AO: A bit like this. DP: Like this. Yes. 	1
Wrong. Actually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology, and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important. 	1
If you compare an individual who has slept at night, or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much, the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night. 	1
Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure. 	1
And the third, which I think is the most exciting, is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target. 	1
Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink, sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations.  This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973. 	1
In fact, we also have a light-controlled "off" switch, and it's very easy to imagine that by installing this light-controlled "off" switch, we can also turn off a memory, any time, anywhere. 	1
Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes, chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it, and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene and make it look like a two-dimensional painting. 	1
If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life, because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. 	1
 When I was at school, the books were transcribed by transcribers, voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read, and that had been going on, mainly by women, since the late 19th century in this country, but it was the only way I could read. 	1
 But think of it. These men, who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had, helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help. 	1
Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like? 	1
If you want your business competitors to go down, well, they can. 	1
He's got lots of cool information in front of him, high-tech equipment, he's got cameras, he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears, all these senses, all these perceptions. 	1
Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist, and we both study complex networks. 	1
So as we go in here, what we start to see, apply the physics engine again, we see what's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones. 	1
So you've got food economy and local food at the top, you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste. 	1
This process does no harm, and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. 	1
What could the future of animal products look like? 	1
So the police took a picture of Titus, they put it in a photo lineup, they later showed it to the victim, and she pointed to Titus' photo. 	1
I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well, where no matter how many buckets you take out, there's always another bucket of water to be had, or my particularly favorite one, with the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond. 	1
You ask them to go up an inclined plane, and they fall over. 	1
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones, one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump, one of the lucky ones who survives. 	1
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah, which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west, and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains. 	1
And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy, and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him." 	1
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he? 	1
And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David. 	1
What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness. 	1
Until the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person's physical death, the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person, or "to mama," a person who is asleep, and they continue to be a member of the household. 	1
It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States. 	1
And most importantly, true love will find you when you least expect it." 	1
If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara, California, you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations, you can buy a prison cell upgrade. 	1
If we can break down this sort of divide, this unease, this tension, this sense that we're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems, we can break this down, and we finally, I think, can have solutions. 	1
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. 	1
I'd seen a lot of death, in particular epidemic death, and epidemic death has a different feel to it. 	1
The other explanation or, in a way, the solution suggested, is please fix all of these things: the schools, the community, the homes, the families, everything. 	1
And the second thing to do, of course, is to prevent further spread, that means to find who else has been exposed, but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of T.B., or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods, but in the same group, and then they need to be, in a way, managed as well, particular to the specific disease process. 	1
So violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease. 	1
According to the Center for Disease Control, fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes. 	1
And during World War II, what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions, and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye, but the very interesting thing about it was that material, actually, wasn't causing any inflammatory response. 	1
Throughout the tower, you come across all kinds of services, like the barber, small factories, and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. 	1
But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area. 	1
So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months. 	1
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us. 	1
However, they also lack knowledge and self-awareness. 	1
Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is, whether you like it or not. 	1
And at the risk of playing the serpent, I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here, the awareness of what is going on, and in your hands, just a few clicks away. 	1
So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children? 	1
One guy offered free secondary school education to all, not just 30 percent. 	1
During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. 	1
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. 	1
So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy. 	1
So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. 	1
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it. 	1
And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better." 	1
Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City, but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. 	1
This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. 	1
So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological, and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy, but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest. 	1
That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. 	1
Investments are being made, but at the current level, it's estimated it's going to take them 50 years to catch up. 	1
At the worst extreme, many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways: by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die, or by abandoning them when the group moves, or by encouraging older people to commit suicide, or by killing older people. 	1
First, as regards usefulness, older people continue to perform useful services. 	1
Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. 	1
Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long-term plans. 	1
They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. 	1
Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history, and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. 	1
So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work, which for still quite a lot of bits of government, that's a serious issue. 	1
There is, at the moment, a stale debate going on very often: state's better, public sector's better, private sector's better, social sector's better, for a lot of these programs. 	1
We're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry, the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. 	1
Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge, because different from health or education or housing, it tends to get worse as societies become richer. 	1
And that was also shocking, because suddenly, I realized, as the captain said to me, that I had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship. 	1
But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds, because I want to salute those seafarers who bring us 90 percent of everything and get very little thanks or recognition for it. 	1
And even though a book is limited by beginning and end, the characters within it know no horizons. 	1
One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large, but the economy was too small. 	1
Rich Player 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board. 	1
Now this game of Monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure, wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status, and a lot of people don't. 	1
In fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse, and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same, at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years. 	1
In fact, that early stage of the funding process, that Phase I and pre-clinical stuff, that's actually, in the industry, called the Valley of Death because it's where drugs go to die. 	1
You do that for the course of the transaction, and when you're done, you liquidate the portfolio, pay back the bonds, and you can give the equity holders a nice return. 	1
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version, we just can't make that happen, and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. 	1
The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth: growth that is consistent, quarter on quarter; growth that is competitive, better than the other person; and growth that is profitable, so you continue to make more and more shareholder value. 	1
Please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work. 	1
It's just that we judge them through a different lens, and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead, are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss, and in a woman, she's bossy. 	1
So at edX and a number of other organizations, we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education. 	1
In fact, one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year, he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year, and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark: &amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&amp;quot; When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework? 	1
And what I saw in that room, as we talked about how to reduce crime, were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes. 	1
Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly? 	1
I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here. 	1
You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet. 	1
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures. 	1
The first led almost immediately to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, both of which represented giant leaps forward. 	1
The minute the ad break comes on, this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France, because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time. 	1
What would that look like that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system? 	1
You might struggle to see that at the back, because the gap is quite small. 	1
Now a lot of people were really angry about this, especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars for what was a very simple app. 	1
A rating can range from a so-called AAA, which means it's a top-performing product, and it can go down to the level of the so-called BBB-, which means it's a fairly risky investment. 	1
INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology. 	1
Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. 	1
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain, and cost a lot of money. 	1
In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London, and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse, he had the idea for this. 	1
For a punishment to achieve its objective, it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime, and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment that the commission of the crime will produce. 	1
and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. 	1
I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. 	1
It castrates them, it changes their color from transparent to bright red, it makes them live longer, and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found, it makes them swim in groups. 	1
For the first time, I realized people were smart 2,000 years ago.  This had never crossed my mind. 	1
Machine vision, special sensors, and high-performance computing can do a lot of this, but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board. 	1
The beginning is now only a handful of years away, and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades. 	1
We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech-dependent world, that art and design are not luxuries, nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering. 	1
So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science. 	1
People marched to demand -- okay, not really exactly like that — but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. 	1
And what was astonishing to me, something I completely did not expect to find, was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue. 	1
And then whatever that number is, we are going to kickstart, sort of, because you can't use KickStarter for political work, but anyway, kickstart, sort of, first a bottom-up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals, and when those goals have been reached, we will turn to the large dollar contributors, to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary 	1
If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom, I don't care how big or small the building is, you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college. 	1
Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very, very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow. 	1
I was born and raised in Sierra Leone, a small and very beautiful country in West Africa, a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent. 	1
The reason, I would come to find out, was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. 	1
My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them. For me, a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies. 	1
MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona, which was just outside Gabby's state senate district. 	1
 MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often at a colossally slow pace, but my wife, and I have to admit, a lot of other members of Congress that I know, work incredibly hard. 	1
I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves, and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves. 	1
It's scattering inside the telescope, creating that very bright image that washes out the planet. 	1
We build a big screen, we fly it in space, we put it up in front of the star, we block out most of the light, we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created, and boom, we get to see planets. 	1
These letters look as though they've been chewed by the dog or something or other, but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting, revising the font accordingly. 	1
If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week, you might describe it in more general terms. 	1
Now Harry Butler, who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist, had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. 	1
We use "release early, release often" on our software. 	1
I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time. 	1
And as the large got larger, small got smaller, and the weird weirder. 	1
The different scales that give you these kinds of patterns range over an enormous range of magnitude, roughly 14 orders of magnitude, from the small microscopic particles to the size of the planet itself, from 10 to the minus six to 10 to the eight, 14 orders of spatial magnitude. 	1
And if you ask the models why did that happen, and you say, okay, well, yes, basically it's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. 	1
There's a great phrase that Sherwood Rowland, who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion, when he was accepting his Nobel Prize, he asked this question: "What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if, in the end, all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true?" 	1
One example from corporate America: Even though white men make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population, they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats. 	1
We have to be willing, as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists, proactive conversations about race with honesty and understanding and courage, not because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do, because our businesses and our products and our science, our research, all of that will be better with greater diversity. 	1
In the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command a special operations task force, and that task force was spread across the Mideast to fight al Qaeda. 	1
So if you were watching this whole thing from a hill, ideally, far away, what you'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds, followed by a blast wave spreading out, shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium, and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city.  So the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy, 	1
It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm that's so similar to the one that we recently invented, but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about, and ants have had 130 million years to evolve a lot of good ones, and I think it's very likely that some of the other 12,000 species are going to have interesting algorithms for data networks that we haven't even thought of yet. 	1
So another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with is resources, finding and collecting them. 	1
A lot of good quality work, too: "The Sandman," "Watchmen." 	1
It's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have, and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle and the number of areolar glands she has. 	1
This means that if we take that fishery catch that's on the decline and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it up to 100 million metric tons per year. 	1
It can reduce our risks of cancer, heart disease and obesity. 	1
And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring, a sort of resilience decoder ring that we're going to try to build. 	1
 These experiences eventually allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women, for which I'm grateful, but I was at war with myself, and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche. 	1
Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done could have been applied to other topics. 	1
They were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people, the vast majority of us as we were training, couldn't even point out on a map. 	1
Please forgive us when we spend one week in a place that has 100 percent light discipline, because you're not allowed to walk around with white lights, because if anything has a white light, it can be seen from miles away, versus if you use little green or little blue lights, they cannot be seen from far away. 	1
 The fact is, whether you're a rock star or whether you're a welder in a shipyard, or a tribesman in the upper Amazon, or the queen of England, we're all in the same boat. ♪ Aye, the footmen are frantic in their indignation ♪ ♪ You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station ♪ ♪ Where the porters, surprised by her lack of royal baggage ♪ ♪ Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage ♪ 	1
It would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed, but Rattray knew that this was religion because souls were in play. 	1
We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. 	1
He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well, and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles. 	1
If you'd like to explore the risky paths needed to get out of the cloud, you need other emotions -- solidarity, support, hope — that come with your connection from somebody else, so like in improvisation theater, in science, it's best to walk into the unknown together. 	1
And eventually I managed to get out the cloud using improvisation and music. 	1
And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries, the empty space. 	1
And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe. 	1
And quite soon after I moved there, I ended up where I still am with my wife, formerly our kids, in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle, no car, no TV I can understand, and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist, so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion. 	1
The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace traditional methods. 	1
And as we sit here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental restorations. 	1
And pick up another marker for me and take off the cap. Isn't this fun? 	1
Now, when they implemented this new policy, a lot of people, my colleagues and friends, came up to me and they said, "Wow, now that's really unusable. 	1
The other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords, there was actually a lot of similarities, and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually, collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords. 	1
"As young as I look, I am growing older faster than he. 	1
And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius -- well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars, but imagine you're out in the country, imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in December, we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. 	1
Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside, so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations. 	1
So I spent some time trying to put this together, but wasn't having a whole lot of luck, and finally I decided, I'm going to get through this, I'm going to come in on a weekend, and I'm not going to leave until I figure out what this represents. 	1
This is what your contacts list would look like if I were examining it. 	1
This is what I'm after in the end, but this is its visual abstraction. 	1
We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts. 	1
And indeed, if you look further down the list, I don't have the slide here, you will see something that made me very happy indeed, that Kenya is in the top 30, and that demonstrates one very, very important thing. 	1
I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country, and then I started thinking I wanted to live in a happy country, but I began to realize, it's not enough. 	1
So Stalin apocryphally said, "A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic," and Mother Teresa said, "If I look at the mass, I will never act. 	1
She can buy this box and she can manufacture it. 	1
Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks, but it's also terrible for business too. 	1
Capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for creating prosperity in human societies, but capitalism, because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems, tends towards, inexorably, inequality, concentration and collapse. 	1
Clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle. 	1
Out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments. 	1
We need more small pilots where we learn as we go, pilots that change the range of possibility. 	1
Civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward, and this great innovation, this great wave of localism that's now arriving, and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives, this isn't some precious parochialism, this isn't some retreat into insularity, no. 	1
And so, for instance, consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike-friendly have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle. 	1
I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data, clinical data is available to scientists to do research. 	1
Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination, and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series, a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes, a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes, and the end of every book, they get the bad guy with their hairnet, and they proclaim, "Justice is served!" 	1
During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations. 	1
This is legit. In fact, some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels, which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely, oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs who care about each other or who enjoy each other's company, and beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals, 	1
At 19, I helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage. 	1
The Internet was born in 1982 and it instantly took over global communication, and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints are uplifted to the Internet so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk and watch this crap, the Internet is awesome. 	1
If you have seen some of the images of the Caribbean people arriving in the '40s and '50s, you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear trilbies. 	1
"Let's get your vital signs" — measure your blood pressure and your heart rate, but let's also ask something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles. 	1
The honest answer is that in healthcare, we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place. 	1
So that may seem crazy, but actually, we humans do this all the time. 	1
These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run, and it was started, this project, last year by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling.  He's cofounder and director, and he wanted, Ola told me when we fight devastating ignorance. 	1
The challenge we have now is to get away from that, understand where the majority is, and that is very clearly shown in this question. 	1
I was in charge of the four-year-olds, which is good, because four-year-olds can't play sports, and neither can I. 	1
Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so. 	1
What we find is that when we have a large body of data, we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts. 	1
Until a recent time, a lot of women were not allowed to work or pursue education. 	1
At times of such doubled war including both social restrictions on women and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, women's dark and bright stories were fading away. 	1
So at North Carolina State University, we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution, and this is what they came up with: a simple, modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit and into a collecting drum, and now the pit worker doesn't have to go down into the pit. 	1
Hundreds of Haitian graduates had to pick up the pieces, overcome their own heartbreak, and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for Haiti. 	1
Let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic, dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons. 	1
Just to give you one example, this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings over the 1987-2013 period, and you can see the very top wealth holders have been going up at six, seven percent per year in real terms above inflation, whereas average income in the world, average wealth in the world, have increased at only two percent per year. 	1
When inequality gets too extreme, then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low mobility. 	1
But if you look really closely at this diagram, you'll see something that doesn't make a lot of sense. 	1
And yet, this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid, while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy, through regulations. 	1
Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering. 	1
They should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies so that they can send money at a low cost, while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world. 	1
But equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people. 	1
The other really destructive and, I think, even more insidious lesson that comes from accepting this mindset is there's an implicit bargain that people who accept this mindset have accepted, and that bargain is this: If you're willing to render yourself sufficiently harmless, sufficiently unthreatening to those who wield political power, then and only then can you be free of the dangers of surveillance. 	1
In that process, she found out that first, she was not alone. 	1
Every second in Asia and Africa, 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family. 	1
Last week, my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing: the death of a newborn. 	1
And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family, don't look far: buy her soap. 	1
So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression. 	1
But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears, and about 30 years ago, the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book called "Amusing Ourselves to Death," which lays this out really brilliantly. 	1
I vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house. 	1
Today, we have 700 of them that are being groomed for the African continent, and over the next 50 years, we expect to create 6,000 of them. 	1
Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food and give birth to healthier babies. 	1
We did a lot of science, and again, because of the luxury of time, we were able to do over three years of science in 31 days. 	1
And by doing this, we can achieve justness together. 	1
So I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked, which was amazingly convenient, and I had chemotherapy and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in, and so before I say another word, let me just say right now, this is the fake one.  I have found that I need to get that out of the way, because I'll see somebody go "Oh, I know it's this one." 	1
Maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change. 	1
It may seem obvious, but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative. 	1
I am going to talk about gigantic trees that we put in nine strategic pathways in the jungle covered with Christmas lights. 	1
And I get very emotional when I remember him because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him, but I wanted you all to see him, because he was really, really important. 	1
When I get out of this, am I going to be rejected?" 	1
Now, Centella asiatica grows across the world in many different habitats — in Africa, in Asia — and this plant has been instrumental in providing a solution to that dreadful disease called leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s. 	1
The more complex the problem, the more the need for simplicity. 	1
What we said was, what if, instead of thinking of 40 square meters as a small house, why don't we consider it half of a good one? 	1
 DU: So the last day of filming, we ended up in Vila Cruzeiro, and we were sitting down and we had a drink, and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses, and most of these houses looked unfinished, and they had walls of bare brick, but we saw some of these houses which were plastered and painted, and suddenly we had this idea: what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted? 	1
People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void. 	1
There's other people who have kids, one's addicted to alcohol, the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin, and they ask themselves the question: Why does this kid get to take one step at a time and try to get better and that one's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time? 	1
Just to save a few pennies on the price of meat, we've spent a lot of antibiotics on animals, not for treatment, not for sick animals, but primarily for growth promotion. 	1
Now, if you think about how we deal with energy pricing, for instance, we consider emissions taxes, which means we're imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy. 	1
An option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business. 	1
I actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals, that's why they got ALS, and I was like, "I don't think so," but I had to get away from the negativity. 	1
That's one factor among many, but youthfulness combined with unemployment, lack of education, and -- this is the kicker -- being male, is a deadly proposition. 	1
It was later developed into ACE inhibitors. 	1
This time, she's waiting for this meeting, because this time, she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress, a camera that nobody else can see. 	1
While building the organization in London, we've been traveling undercover to places where a community was suffering from abuses, where mass atrocities were happening, and there was a lack of reporting. 	1
I've never felt as small as I did in Antarctica. 	1
Right now, I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets. 	1
Number one, a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills. 	1
But there's something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own. 	1
In the United States and now internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues, as peers, as doctors. 	1
Luckily for us, they met us with laughter, very, very good laughter, so one bright day in September, we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes. 	1
This was waving TV for five and a half days, and people get so extremely happy when they can send a warm message to their loved ones. 	1
because it seems as though we're living in a very small town. 	1
Thanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs, I had to live a beautiful life of songs, cultures, traditions, stories, mountains, and a lot of sheep. 	1
I had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story. 	1
KB: Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can, because now that the foundation's in the beginning process, I am trying to learn a lot about how to operate, how to get funding or reach out to more organizations, and especially in the e-commerce, which is very new for me. 	1
If you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker, now, a lot of people, myself included, I should say, think that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous and possibly one of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked on the face of the Earth. 	1
Now, I think it's important to point out at this stage, that these exact equations have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries in an arms race. 	1
Now, the negativity threshold, you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get really pissed off, and vice versa. 	1
Because of their pimped carroças, they are able to fight back to prejudice, increase their income and their interaction with society. 	1
So with a bit of imagination, we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. 	1
It was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state. 	1
When we find the grave, we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body, document it, and exhume it. 	1
We'll take that DNA and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families, of course. 	1
Check out that haircut. It's a bit odd.  And at the age of 11, I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles. 	1
And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department, we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation, and make a plan to combat that at a national level, involving the local governments, the civil society, business, local communities, in an effort that could tackle those causes. 	1
Well, however complex politically, economically, scientifically the question of the environment is, it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness. 	1
The Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty, cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere, of the oceans. 	1
So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water, for example. 	1
But when I'm really small, the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass, which is what causes that bouncy motion. 	1
So I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale. 	1
So it is fitting and scary that I have returned to this city 16 years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding. 	1
 So we, together with a lot of villages, we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation. 	1
It was everywhere in the park -- well, along with a lot of tear gas. 	1
And think of more recent initiatives, like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags. 	1
And Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was. 	1
They met right around that time, they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency joint operation center in Conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped, to implement the strategies we talked about. 	1
What happened then was the virus, or someone sick with the virus, boarded an airplane, flew to another country, and for the first time, we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again. 	1
And as you can anticipate, there was international alarm, international concern on a scale that we hadn't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this. 	1
It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it. 	1
So now let's look at what some psychological gender differences look like on the same standardized scale. 	1
So the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost on a narrow range of tasks. 	1
I think of my work as sort of a remix, in a way, because I'm working with somebody else's material in the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music. 	1
They get sick like you. They get sick like me. 	1
Now, these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple. 	1
To achieve this effect of herd immunity, it is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated. 	1
The patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter, with longer fevers. 	1
Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg." 	1
So when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp. 	1

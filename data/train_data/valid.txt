Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. 	1
No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that? 	1
 That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. 	1
Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. 	1
Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943? 	1
So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. 	1
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs. 	1
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up. 	1
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. 	1
 If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. 	1
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. 	1
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool. 	1
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none. 	1
This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. 	1
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. 	1
However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. 	1
So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this. 	1
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know. 	1
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something? 	1
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought, "You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. 	1
And we're in the process of sequencing all that Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. 	1
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. 	1
And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability. 	1
Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. 	1
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. 	1
 In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. 	1
KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? 	1
DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. 	1
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable. 	1
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane. 	1
I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour. 	1
A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- 	1
and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, "Can I try that?" 	1
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. 	1
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. 	1
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. 	1
The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. 	1
This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it. 	1
And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. 	1
And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body, it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network. 	1
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors, and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines, and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. 	1
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings. 	1
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things, and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know? 	1
And the guy looked at me and said, "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?" 	1
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that. 	1
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat. 	1
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. 	1
The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work. 	1
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater. 	1
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself. 	1
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say, to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes. 	1
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system. 	1
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said, how many of these things are still being made? 	1
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way." 	1
"You know, let's just make an educated guess," and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle. 	1
And Howard looked to that and said, "That's wrong!" 	1
Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment. 	1
You see the happy face on Mars, there.  If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog. 	1
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs. 	1
 It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look. 	1
 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. 	1
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess. 	1
In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. 	1
And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books, using them and teaching from them. 	1
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook. 	1
And people who are teachers out here -- whoever taught, you know this -- it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about. 	1
We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site. 	1
So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this as a call to action. 	1
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. 	1
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too. 	1
For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable. 	1
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang, 	1
To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack -- and I'm not really focusing on the negatives, but really, there's another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates just of random, young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States, the death rates during crack were about one percent. 	1
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. 	1
But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes, indeed, the car seats don't perform as well. 	1
And so if we look at recent crashes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data -- you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better." 	1
It's kind of an interesting logic, I think, that people use. And the other logic, they say, "Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much. 	1
I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids? 	1
I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things. 	1
You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture, and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters. 	1
Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do -- I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do.  But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know, they would only let me do other things. 	1
But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original. 	1
On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think -- and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group. 	1
I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years, we can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal. 	1
This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. 	1
So I took this picture three days after she arrived, and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on, with her toes sticking out. 	1
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple. 	1
 just before 9/11 -- August of 2001 -- I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan. 	1
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best. 	1
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up? 	1
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. 	1
I just put them down like they were in the books. 	1
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right." 	1
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. 	1
They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio, and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. 	1
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built. 	1
And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. 	1
People are always asking, "Well, who's in charge of this?" 	1
And what's interesting about this is that the software is -- these votes are just text typed into a page. 	1
Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, "OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it." 	1
But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. 	1
Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. 	1
And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. 	1
I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is. 	1
If you really look at the power of exponential growth, you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. 	1
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. 	1
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. 	1
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say. 	1
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. 	1
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it? 	1
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK. 	1
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer." 	1
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. 	1
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it. 	1
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete? 	1
I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team. 	1
And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned. 	1
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist, just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. 	1
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. 	1
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do? 	1
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem. 	1
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time. 	1
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children? 	1
Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points; these are -- let's see, how far have I talked? 	1
A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book. 	1
But part of the reason -- and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. 	1
But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value. 	1
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. 	1
And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. 	1
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.  And they are. So let me start with the second one: "Typical." Well, is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum --  and that's not typical of the universe at all. 	1
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us. 	1
So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. 	1
Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. 	1
You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said, "How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity?" 	1
I don't know exactly how to do this yet, but, you know, it's something being actively thought about. 	1
You could just hang it as a bed sheet, but again, the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape. 	1
Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, "You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. 	1
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time. 	1
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view. 	1
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon. 	1
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. 	1
We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. 	1
It's built, it's running and she just started a business today, where she's washing other people's clothes. 	1
This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year. 	1
I showed you something that took 20 years to do. 	1
You have a diverse community of participants -- and we're not just talking about inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. 	1
When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy. 	1
And I always answered, "Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for." 	1
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen. 	1
And so that's what really kind of started me off. 	1
But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on. 	1
How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future? 	1
He kind of redefined us as an American population. 	1
It's about those children who took to the streets -- fighting, screaming, "Free Nelson Mandela!" 	1
There's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace, and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool, to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. 	1
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way. 	1
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh, I started to look at our world globally. These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to. 	1
But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram? 	1
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights, gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. 	1
The comprehensive solution: this is the device; it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough, just the thickness of most cranial bones. 	1
Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal, which means they did not get the epileptic seizure. 	1
By day nine -- you look at this picture and you're horrified; I look at this picture and I say, "Thank God," because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox, and I know this child will live. 	1
LB: Well, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. 	1
We just need your help in making it happen. 	1
So here I am with the couple, the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know. 	1
"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret. 	1
 When I started this project called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character" with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers, drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations, because my first big show was a show about a race riot. 	1
Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too. 	1
I mean, I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died. 	1
No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854 in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story -- in brief -- of this outbreak, which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today, and particularly the kind of city that we live in today. 	1
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. 	1
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. 	1
If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in. 	1
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English. 	1
 In Westchester, they call it a Pooki, in New Jersey, a twat. 	1
And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina -- that it was dried-up and finished and dead -- and I was kind of shocked. So I said to a friend casually, "Well, what do you think about your vagina?" 	1
So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now, other than probably its newfound accessibility. 	1
What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see. 	1
Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know, I could be doing this with as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user. 	1
Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. 	1
Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. 	1
 Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now! 	1
 And there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's, "How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?" 	1
Well, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, "Genes." 	1
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world, and how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it. 	1
And at the trial, her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million. 	1
It's all very well to say, "Let's do our best to present the evidence." 	1
And in fact, that's actually sustaining a long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK, that biological evolution was doing for us. 	1
But then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff, which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution. 	1
With the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires. 	1
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been, OK. This was not a prevalent view, few thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic. 	1
I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities, ethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me, you know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan, well, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car. 	1
I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality. 	1
It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah, I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need, you know. 	1
So I'm not really worried about it. So --  -- I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts, but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again, non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level. 	1
And a kind of saving higher moral level, something that kind of literally saves the world. 	1
It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now. 	1
And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth. 	1
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. 	1
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer. 	1
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. 	1
It's going to look a little bit like that. 	1
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness. 	1
But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this? 	1
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. 	1
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. 	1
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it? 	1
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. 	1
But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too. 	1
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, "You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me." 	1
Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much. 	1
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car? 	1
You know, that it's not just enough to survive. 	1
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. 	1
Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix. 	1
She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. 	1
And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises, which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think, well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds, to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. 	1
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. 	1
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. 	1
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell. 	1
So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab, and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big. 	1
We can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents. What do you see here? 	1
Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed, and actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do these things. Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did 	1
I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. 	1
So the question was, I started looking at this issue, and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York. 	1
And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores. 	1
 And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is, it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that, AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root. 	1
This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes. 	1
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings, and what the program is for those cells to differentiate, one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer, and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas. 	1
Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong. 	1
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but... 	1
I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said, "I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there. 	1
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. 	1
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria, which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide. 	1
I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island -- and this is true of practically every part of the world -- which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever. 	1
After several weeks, they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men. 	1
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. 	1
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden, is a mystery to me. 	1
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. 	1
So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered. 	1
And I said, "No, I don't," because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'? 	1
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back. 	1
I became interested in puppets, and I just want to show one last thing to you. 	1
And skiing along that first trip, I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going. 	1
The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga, which was the sort of last bit of civilization. 	1
There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter, so we were stuck. We couldn't move. 	1
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming, photography; while the helicopter was still there, I did an interview on the satellite phone; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter, wham, the door closed, and I was alone. 	1
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice; we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said, "Just -- just get in the back." 	1
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. 	1
Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here: from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal, you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device. 	1
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough, you can solve the problems. 	1
About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. 	1
They have a biological base, just like the aurochs. 	1
So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history, about their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements. 	1
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. 	1
And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow So it was sort of a spooky story. 	1
I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. 	1
Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say there's two master lessons. 	1
I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. 	1
Now, when psychologists show you bars, you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. 	1
"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper! 	1
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? That seems like a one-question IQ test. 	1
Every time you drink a glass of water, he points out, the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell.  It's just elementary probability theory. 	1
And of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders -- you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree. 	1
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. 	1
Even when you know that they're all going to change color, it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. 	1
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK. 	1
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. 	1
I love this one. I'll end with this one, just because it's such an obvious and important thing. 	1
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do. 	1
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here." 	1
Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- 	1
I cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying, "Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they're deaf." 	1
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to? 	1
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate, because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed? 	1
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here," and we say, "That's not part of my plan," then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. 	1
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility, reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage. 	1
Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, clean water, soil and power -- economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period. 	1
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace. 	1
I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet, with such an incredible last half a dozen years, that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. 	1
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. 	1
And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January, I found myself standing in front of my congregation -- intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people -- and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions. 	1
If God is a bystander, observing but not involved, then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him. 	1
A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism? 	1
An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things. 	1
Is God just another name for the universe, with no independent existence at all? 	1
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further. 	1
Well, so much for quantity. How about quality? 	1
Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it." 	1
 So I wanted to show you guys -- I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you -- as a completely natural user interface. 	1
 OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness. 	1
And the really wonderful thing about this is, when you're done, well -- you can eat it. 	1
  OK, so, Einstein, what's your favorite singing group? 	1
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough. 	1
So first of all we decided --  that we needed about one-third bookstore, one-third Google cafe, about 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel, about five percent for restrooms. 	1
It's "infectious repetitis," and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. 	1
Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct.  But in fact that's not why they went extinct. 	1
SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. 	1
So this is some of the challenge that we have here, is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the -- there we go. 	1
So this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service, and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. 	1
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. 	1
And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. 	1
And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said, "You know, I'm sleeping a lot." 	1
He was just kind of writing about his life. 	1
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? 	1
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore. 	1
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and -- I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there?  Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting. 	1
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship. 	1
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on. 	1
And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about seven or eight years, this project -- and [we're] just ready to start building them. 	1
And I said, no, you really ought to study brains. They said, oh, you know, you're wrong. And I said, no, you're wrong, and I didn't get in. 	1
Why do we study ants? Well, it's interesting. 	1
But, you know what? It's very, very regular. 	1
And it doesn't fit, so it gets all wrinkly. Now look at how I've drawn this here. 	1
And so when you look at someone's face, you'd typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth. 	1
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain. 	1
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish. 	1
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story? 	1
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so -- so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop. 	1
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. 	1
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. 	1
They're not big migrators. This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. 	1
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping. 	1
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita. 	1
It's necessary and, just as important, it's good for the California economy. 	1
And we're encouraging others to do it as well. 	1
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. 	1
With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened. 	1
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. 	1
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago, they went and took everything away from the haves. 	1
Because when you open up like that, then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery? 	1
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. 	1
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral -- you know, what's visible, what's not. 	1
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. 	1
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way, is artificially illuminated at great effort. 	1
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. 	1
So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked, "Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?" 	1
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels. 	1
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go, and by coming back -- just by making it back -- they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out. 	1
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area. 	1
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up. 	1
But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods, and the way she went about things, and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly. 	1
Because it's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out, but when you can give them a toy, and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes, I think it's an entirely different kind of point of view, where we're actually mapping, using the game to re-map our intuition. 	1
I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with, again, as toys. 	1
That's like me telling you, "Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?" 	1
Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair. 	1
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet. 	1
You know, as you can see, from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion. 	1
It didn't look like it was going to work. 	1
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was looking at people and giving them meds. 	1
If you want to know about Africa, read our literature -- and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying, "I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America." 	1
I mean, picture this -- really picture this. 	1
But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt. 	1
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system. 	1
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea." 	1
And at the end of it, we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful." 	1
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success. 	1
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them. 	1
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary. 	1
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny. 	1
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses." 	1
at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated over and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink, rather than how high our standards have risen. 	1
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game, and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances, cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time. 	1
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about, that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology, by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth? 	1
You may just be loud or obnoxious, or some other way causing them to have the headache. 	1
In the workplace, for example, there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss, or refer to him or her If two friends have a reciprocal transaction, like selling a car, it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. 	1
What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in? 	1
Secondly -- and you're going to hear more from me about this -- we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation. 	1
National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know, almost all the money that's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government, one way or another. 	1
But what happens, as this occurs, is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years, and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun, that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry.   SP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue. 	1
You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes. 	1
You know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you, it's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish, cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code. 	1
We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets. 	1
Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air. 	1
It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam, and you see the face here covered by sandstone. 	1
And I think that's just a horrible thing. 	1
21:00 hours, and it's just our squad going through today's events in our heads, whether we want to or not. 	1
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know. 	1
And usually, the first questions are, "Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?" 	1
You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing, but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers. 	1
 So, I looked for a different show to watch. 	1
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997, and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space, because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks, you're cooler for some reason. 	1
And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird. 	1
So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries, and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme, and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images. 	1
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity." 	1
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys. 	1
And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world. 	1
They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom, and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here. 	1
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back and we look at planet Earth, and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society, then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry. 	1
You know, who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels, with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on. 	1
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things. 	1
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- 	1
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes. 	1
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result. 	1
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English." 	1
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems. 	1
The weather modification subject was getting started, and as a graduate student, on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast, and so on. And everybody would talk to me, but all the professionals in the field hated each other, and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result, I got the absolutely unique background in that field, and started a company, which did more research in weather modification than anybody, and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into. 	1
I have no idea of what comes next, so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future, as a little warning. 	1
 And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want, and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production, so you have real collector's items. 	1
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus. 	1
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like. 	1
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us. 	1
 When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here, it's very strange. 	1
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that: just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which -- just in case anything had happened. 	1
RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner, the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats, and crashing into the seas. 	1
I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know, I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe, but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross. 	1
 RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said, "Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram. 	1
  CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being, you know, doing pretty miserably academically, but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams. 	1
And I think it's important that the individuals, who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars, but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world. 	1
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea, getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world. 	1
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101, so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go. 	1
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house, because everybody's always, you know, leaving, they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail, and he runs to the other room. 	1
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true. 	1
I said, people should know about this book. 	1
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in." 	1
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell, and "could" is an August Sander subject. 	1
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away. 	1
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov, sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair, leafing through a book and butterflies, imagine such displacement, such loss?" 	1
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because, you know, we're from Russia. 	1
 So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment. 	1
If you look at the first slide there, that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK -- the lobes that constitute the brain. 	1
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks, and you know it's a mirror, but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. 	1
This is called the Capgras delusion, and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal, has had a head injury, comes out of coma, otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother and says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman, but she's an impostor. 	1
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality. 	1
Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common, the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking, linking seemingly unrelated ideas, such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun." 	1
You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?" 	1
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face. 	1
I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. 	1
♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here on my screen. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫ ♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers, ♫ ♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫ ♫ Uh-huh ... ♫ ♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫ 	1
They thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second. 	1
Bones were broken. Especially in old, fragile people, you couldn't use it. 	1
But more importantly, I think, is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under 30, and there are many, of course, who are well over 30. 	1
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to. 	1
OK, so when we did this research, we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way to never forget anything ever, ever again. 	1
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal, and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication, I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK? 	1
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier. 	1
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks. 	1
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences," and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner, right? 	1
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on, and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design. 	1
And happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being. 	1
So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness? Very often, we look outside. 	1
So one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things, but isn't it nice, also, to build something within?" 	1
So, there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being. 	1
So what we need to look for now is, instead of looking outward, we look inward. 	1
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it. 	1
And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this. 	1
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment. 	1
So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. 	1
end up with systems that look like this. 	1
What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take agriculture over a century, agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules, but the farmer would have understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when 	1
Any place you see a differential, there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying exactly the same technology. 	1
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14 bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the 	1
We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles, and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law. 	1
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin. 	1
Well, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here. 	1
Now if we look at animals, though, to be really maneuverable in all surfaces, the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws, and spines, and hairs, and pads, and glue, and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things. 	1
We have imagined products; for example, this one: we imagined a bio-inspired Band-Aid, where we took the glue off the Band-Aid. 	1
We can start, if you want, by understanding -- it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work. 	1
Because the scenario of this civilization -- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK, but there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations. 	1
 And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief, and my French is not very good; I said something like, "I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof." 	1
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields." 	1
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity -- so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other -- you see very different uses for fractals. 	1
  So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this. 	1
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization, as we heard earlier, it's in the brain. 	1
At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard, decided to write a book about a serial killer. 	1
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects. 	1
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter. 	1
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. 	1
Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. 	1
That's all bioluminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies. 	1
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art. 	1
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine, so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself. 	1
Well, maybe he was too trusting, because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest. 	1
It was he who broke the Mayan codex, enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script. 	1
And it was only at that moment, as we were sitting down to dinner, that I recognized the enormity of the risk I had created, because to bring these two titans, these two masters of the universe together -- it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo. 	1
And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life. 	1
Well, we did win, and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden. 	1
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board, and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase, and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech. 	1
And I said, "If I can follow that music, I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK. 	1
This image, for example, is sort of spot-on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private, and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush reading the Koran upside-down. 	1
People adore the company. And it's better, you know? They like it. 	1
We're transferring just a few little data bits when we're doing road controlling, road pricing. 	1
So to start, I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers. 	1
They then move out to the next one, and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth. 	1
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives, we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas -- never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled. 	1
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill. 	1
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers, vertical layers -- and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if I got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers. 	1
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book. 	1
But it was the journey of the ...  I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome. 	1
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members; that's not always a good thing, but it does sort of bring pigeons together again. 	1
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace, these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way. 	1
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it. 	1
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons. 	1
So she really struggled with this, what to do, because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together -- I believe it was 100, 150 students all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts, and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school. 	1
And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon; I don't want to be like --  -- you know?" 	1
And I got all excited and came back, and they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island? 	1
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof. 	1
 And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy. 	1
Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that. 	1
 and I'll have a lot more to show you, and if all doesn't go well, I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee. 	1
You know, it was going to be a nice, long trip. 	1
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down. 	1
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic. 	1
And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side, and I found that they matched up very well. 	1
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered. 	1
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do. 	1
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time, and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time? 	1
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." 	1
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh! I'm having a stroke!" 	1
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender. 	1
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation, I've tried to break it up into three parts: the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface. 	1
You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt, but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse, and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen. 	1
Here, the idea is that you're going to take this book, if you will, and it's going to come alive. 	1
There are all sorts of techniques you will use -- and again, this is a different kind of branching. 	1
He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read. 	1
And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on, but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person. 	1
And I put a piece of tape around it, as you see there, and realized you could sit on it, and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on. 	1
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one. 	1
It was a very prominent building off the freeway, and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood, which had these cornices, projecting cornices. 	1
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided? 	1
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom, which I designed like a kind of a barge, looking like a boat. 	1
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free. 	1
It looks like it's kind of been there, and then crashed all these simpler forms into it. 	1
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler, composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc. 	1
 The original building, because it was frog-like, fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well. 	1
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together with the best lecturers in the world -- who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa -- and put them together and just let the sparks fly. 	1
Well, the new South Africa is a very exciting country. 	1
Neil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well. 	1
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous -- and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized.  So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things. 	1
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors, whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place, somebody said, "You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship." 	1
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see, we made it look sort of pirate supply-like. 	1
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater, which is just a saltwater tank with three seats, and then right behind it we set up this space, which was the tutoring center. 	1
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different. 	1
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store, actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money. 	1
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public. 	1
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, "Well, why don't we have a place like that here?" 	1
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form. 	1
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are: how smart and how much they have to say. 	1
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change. 	1
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father, and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine. 	1
And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar. 	1
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters. 	1
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years. 	1
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain. 	1
 It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987, when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. 	1
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre, because I've got gray hair, and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future. 	1
A musician who took time from his life to teach me, a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo. 	1
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay? 	1
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say, "Well, how come you ain't teaching?" 	1
Not just show up to class every now and then. 	1
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads, shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks. 	1
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar. 	1
I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff. 	1
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbs. 	1
There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly. 	1
Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots, so this is actually a multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well. 	1
And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor, which has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it. 	1
And you can see that it looks like a 3D room. 	1
kind of like a video game, it sort of looks 3D, but for the most part, the image looks pretty flat, and bound to the surface of the screen. 	1
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling, I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra, or into something that nobody has ever heard before. 	1
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. 	1
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area -- mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music. 	1
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making. 	1
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. 	1
Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. 	1
One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what -- well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it. 	1
And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly, Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object, which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list. 	1
Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius. 	1
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new. 	1
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain. 	1
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life. 	1
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant -- but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint, but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. 	1
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself -- I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen. 	1
 But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? 	1
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident. 	1
And recently, they've written us letters, telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams, on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal. 	1
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know, I'm going to remind you again, that each generation has to do better than the last one. 	1
More recently, at Einstein University, they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy, much like plants use light. 	1
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view, disease organisms have to get from one host to another, and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host. 	1
Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile, which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America? 	1
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases, and it ought to. 	1
Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. 	1
 OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. 	1
And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted. 	1
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species. 	1
Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger. 	1
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. 	1
We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. 	1
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. 	1
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore," which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. 	1
Most moms cooked like mine: a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing, canned soup, canned fruit salad. 	1
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. 	1
And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now, it's not going to be 40 years. 	1
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. 	1
Well, there's also another program, in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration. 	1
And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks. 	1
You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs. 	1
But then it's connected through Internet too -- the new Internet highway that makes Internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway -- with 10 gigabits of bandwidth. 	1
Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away, and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing. 	1
Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars, and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon, but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet? 	1
And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality. 	1
You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy. 	1
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out. 	1
 And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask. 	1
So, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia. 	1
You know, they say, never play with your food -- but I always play with things. 	1
And they would coalesce for just a moment, so you could perceive that there was a chair there. 	1
There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got. 	1
Look around you -- here will do, in this room. 	1
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme. 	1
They're just information, why would they? 	1
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion" is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years, and hence diverging from the rest of mankind. 	1
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high, but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. 	1
There's -- no reactor's been even built to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return thing that we do. 	1
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business, but, in fact, it's negative. 	1
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like. 	1
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. 	1
I just -- you know, because, yes, I'll focus passion on something, but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again. 	1
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought, "Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down." 	1
That is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail. 	1
But let's look more deeply, and as we do, what appears is the demons, the devils in the world. 	1
They took me to the basement of the police station. 	1
He said, "You know, clearly at some point, we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't." 	1
To say instead of, we must make an advance plan, we must have a five-year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever, you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort, and let's deal with it as we go, because we're now well-enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do. 	1
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. 	1
And Julian Bigelow, who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics, how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this, and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers. 	1
 Every time I look at this piece, I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad, "He finally folded his laundry." 	1
And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well. 	1
And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane, when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question. 	1
  Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance, and can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you, that we studied to look at this, is the gecko. 	1
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back. 	1
And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there, and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves. 	1
 Do you know what I think probably happened here? 	1
You know, every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China -- everybody knows: da, da, da, da -- da. Everybody knows, who's expecting that E. 	1
He said to me something that just went completely over my head. 	1
But it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do -- I've just said it. Don't just give one, get one. 	1
And when he got tired of reading them, he started to teach the men in death row how to read, with these comic books. 	1
♫ Feminists don't have a sense of humor. ♫ ♫ Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo, hoo, hoo. ♫ ♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫ ♫ They have a tumor on their funny bone. ♫ ♫ They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha, ha, ha, ha. ♫ ♫ Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up, ladies. ♫ ♫ Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what’s wrong with that? ♫ 	1

I spent a few days photographing children in different countries, and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists, I always hope that when my pictures were published, they might actually have an effect on a situation, instead of just documenting it. 	1
In the course of doing the story, I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before, and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids. 	1
I took a translator with me, and went to this village, found the grandmother, sat down with her. 	1
This is Father Keene. He's just a wonderful guy. 	1
And I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded, and insisted, that the villagers treat Hyun-Sook with the same respect they treated her. 	1
And the third night, we came back, we'd just gone out to dinner, where you saw the pictures, and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said, "There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight, so if you want to put the kids five floors below you, there's a room there." 	1
It's just, you know, it was just so interesting, just to watch -- this is her mother in the background there. 	1
I mean, she -- you know, we've looked at the pictures together. 	1
You feel kind of sorry for that thing, and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more. 	1
With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different. 	1
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. 	1
Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? 	1
 After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, "I gotta go." 	1
So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life, which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. 	1
It comes from a David Mamet play, and there's two con artists in the play, and the woman is conning the man, and the man looks at the woman and says, "Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you." 	1
I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. 	1
OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK, and I want you to be aware of the pressure. 	1
Do you understand? Just answer yes or no. 	1
 You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. 	1
Don't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up. 	1
No messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up. 	1
"Well, how many words do I get this time?" "I think, well, you get two. 	1
And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. 	1
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke. 	1
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that, I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. 	1
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. 	1
Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. 	1
I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day. 	1
Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it. 	1
And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do? 	1
They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood. 	1
"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner. 	1
And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater, look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. 	1
So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk. 	1
I have three kind of general things I would like to say, three consequences of this. 	1
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. 	1
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah -- all these things are going to become Web based. 	1
And that current, electrical current, is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on. 	1
And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. 	1
You can get horns, antlers -- even, if you look close, cloven hooves. 	1
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes. 	1
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for. 	1
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape. 	1
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era. 	1
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title. 	1
 Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. 	1
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out. 	1
Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature, and came back with not just a collection of photographs, but an amazing experience and a great story. 	1
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. 	1
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now, we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical. 	1
Now, take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe, OK, a three-dimensional space. 	1
OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky? 	1
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies? 	1
The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments, was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago, OK. 	1
Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. 	1
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts, it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK. 	1
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter. 	1
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota, OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. 	1
No reaction? That with even -- OK, and this. 	1
 No, now and then I put in a mistake, just to emphasize how difficult it is. 	1
 OK, I had to use a little force there. 	1
So here, I grab -- you know this? Five of clubs ... 	1
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say? 	1
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me, they will throw tennis balls, they will cook for me and serve the food. 	1
Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK? 	1
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class. 	1
And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. 	1
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know? 	1
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me. 	1
You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know? 	1
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know. 	1
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand. 	1
And he was like, "Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States." 	1
You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave. 	1
So my friends, molecular programmers, and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach. 	1
You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact, and he's got a double-stranded genome -- that's no good. 	1
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it? Or would you just say, that's actually not possible? 	1
And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way, it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on. 	1
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people -- we might as well get it right. 	1
So, children are not empty vessels, OK? 	1
In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK? 	1
And it's not just what these are doing to each other, but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. 	1
And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you and what's not, and then tell me why. 	1
 Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs. 	1
So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers, and the computer begins to express itself. 	1
You know, the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in. 	1
At stake: the battle for you, the consumer, and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America.  PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet, the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks. 	1
They think of the old medium, because the old medium is always the content of the new medium, as movies tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content, novels used to be the content of movies. 	1
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. 	1
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term, in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect? 	1
Please raise your hand high right now. OK. 	1
And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix." 	1
We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile long mountain range. 	1
I just can't get over this -- that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. 	1
If you're born after 1950, this is just -- consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane. 	1
This was Bert the Turtle.  This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war, then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. 	1
That was the principle. You -- there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us, and if you get under your desk, things would be OK. 	1
This is not a product placement. It's just -- in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this --  -- but basically, this is it. 	1
Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. 	1
You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud, I said, in just a few minutes. 	1
I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth. 	1
I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants, you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!" 	1
My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. 	1
But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting. 	1
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes. 	1
We actually went off to make a bookmobile. 	1
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. 	1
The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing -- 26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right? 	1
We only put one week up, which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11, sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see? 	1
Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web. 	1
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?" 	1
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory, praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along, some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. 	1
I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books. 	1
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen. 	1
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed, but it's an issue in the food supply. 	1
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay. 	1
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart, a giraffe, a star? 	1
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people, very, very different, and I needed to market it. 	1
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar, they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack. 	1
And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas. 	1
You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur? 	1
This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know, my muse and my partner for eternity here. 	1
We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair, and we're going to hire you guys to do this." 	1
There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton, but the geometry's correct. 	1
That's what the investors think, that it's just --  -- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys. 	1
Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know. 	1
any more, even. So each child has 46 parents, and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children. 	1
So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. 	1
You're looking for 5 million -- at what valuation? 	1
It lets you know exactly where you're going, helps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit. 	1
But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures, you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures. 	1
And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years, are they going to be everywhere sooner than that? 	1
We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists, and think that computation is everything, but the mechanics still matter. 	1
He's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on. 	1
 So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. 	1
But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines. 	1
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense. 	1
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace." 	1
Because they would have done extraordinarily well. 	1
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens, it cannot be the right strategy, either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war, "Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out, because we opposed the war in the first place." 	1
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field, and it sits on just four very delicate columns. 	1
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. 	1
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective, and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. 	1
And so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. 	1
 And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing, but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin, very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier, the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage. 	1
Actually I'm just going to pause for one second, because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED -- you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. 	1
Well, obviously it's for children, right? 	1
 DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class. 	1
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. 	1
And I thought, well, this is the power of a city. 	1
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now. 	1
It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. 	1
And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. 	1
And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus." 	1
Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. 	1
Google does the Google Zeitgeist, which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in, and they publish it with lots of fun graphs. 	1
It just came out. This is bursty words, looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. 	1
It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man, one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard. 	1
But he read books in every spare moment he could find. 	1
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008. 	1
 So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something. 	1
So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. 	1
In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different -- they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies 	1
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field. 	1
You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger. 	1
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions, and see what the whole pattern looks like. 	1
And this is what this exhibition looks at. 	1
Five: all of which is to say, they made a movie out of the book, "Communion," and it starred Christopher Walken. 	1
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary, in this case the 1913 dictionary. 	1
The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough. 	1
In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier." 	1
How do you create the sense of transcendence, the sense of evoking a perfect world? 	1
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. 	1
Now I thought, you know, if we just did good science, that would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive. 	1
The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness, is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely, in part because, as we talked about, they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on. 	1
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with. 	1
I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable; economically, it's achievable; politically, it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible. 	1
PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere, the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is -- probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite, because it can stay right overhead for months at a time, 	1
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're -- all right -- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees. 	1
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it, looking out of its camera. 	1
Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush. 	1
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there, but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. 	1
So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something. 	1
CA: Just -- KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer. 	1
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle at the ocean. 	1
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good. 	1
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect. 	1
 I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me. 	1
What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well, France is a liberal society." 	1
But I’m just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement. 	1
I think the future of this planet depends on humans, not technology, and we already have the knowledge -- we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge. 	1
Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite -- his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know." 	1
The problem we have in believing that is -- you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. 	1
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. 	1
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo. 	1
But we know that occasionally ants go astray, and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost, they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does. 	1
Even though this one is kind of unusual, I want you to think about your own journey. 	1
And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me. 	1
Now during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and I tried to study the environment by reading books. 	1
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. 	1
And you know, the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. 	1
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. 	1
Not just because they lead to insights about the experience, but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience. 	1
The kind of little face, the portrait you did? 	1
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK? 	1
These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of. 	1
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK? 	1
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know, the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell. 	1
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know, if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs. 	1
Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century, and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency, and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent. 	1
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps, than people who have never done that kind of work. 	1
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting. 	1
 And sometimes -- actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post, that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever, but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on. 	1
Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there, so many clothes out there. 	1
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors, light from behind the projection, or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible. 	1
I don't want to be -- okay. Here we go. 	1
ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first, I think. 	1
A: Oh no, we're just staging, ROD: We're just staging it. 	1
That's more on the play side. And on the right side, that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it. 	1
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them. 	1
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth. 	1
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart, but every once in a while it's good to be lucky. 	1
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited, you know, outside the science community about these Rovers, so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community. 	1
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned. 	1
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet. 	1
So it will be a very tense moment, you know, as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet. 	1
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist. 	1
And just to kind of put us in perspective, this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun. 	1
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this, I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works, because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland. 	1
 Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly, so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler. 	1
Once upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn." 	1
In this case it might well be an image of the clock. 	1
The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone, it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented, maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration. 	1
You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. 	1
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words, a few things about my personal life, because I think there is a connection. 	1
Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it, is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living. 	1
You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives. 	1
I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers, and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe. 	1
It’s technology. I’m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know, the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. 	1
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby, and they're kind of the color of the Sun, and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth. 	1
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars, to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years. 	1
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. 	1
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture, identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies, estimate how far away they are, and plot them up. 	1
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes, but you realize they're not even the main structure. 	1
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is, and you can see what it looks like. 	1
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right? 	1
You can see that just from the map alone. 	1
And so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here, he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep, because there's so many great technologies out there, we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know. 	1
Well, you have to hold people accountable. 	1
 Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. 	1
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old, no one really knows, but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now. 	1
We are human, and we have the capacity to love, we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates, I think. 	1
CA: So, you have to wonder when, you know, if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth, you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip. 	1
And at the same time, we're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that -- snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating. 	1
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. 	1
to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things, and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. 	1
When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever, you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people, but you can't talk to them. 	1
Spiky hair -- spikier than this. Kind of orange hair. 	1
And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies. 	1
Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here, but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober, disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side, has to conclude, based on the data, that with those kinds of economic forces at play, there is definitely going to be a sea change, and that change is going to be intensely disruptive 	1
That's just 12 percent of the population. 	1
You know, I could be wrong about this, but my sense is that in the public mind, today, that GM is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford. 	1
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers, allows us to actually simulate, in this piece, over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64. 	1
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store, and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. 	1
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way. 	1
Try this old song with me. I sing: Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. 	1
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. 	1
Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder. 	1
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay. 	1
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here. 	1
 These were just some of the things I've made. 	1
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did, and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism, that the industrial revolution had broken out, and that I rather should join the factory. 	1
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied, that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman. 	1
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things. 	1
You see, this is a human brain model, OK? 	1
So the next time you download a gigabyte, or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK? 	1
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans, and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form. 	1
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know, each buyer gets their name engraved on it. 	1
Any one of the wines served at this tasting, if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know, the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable. 	1
Now, just in case you're not getting it, here's a schematic of what happened, OK? 	1
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine, and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do? 	1
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK? 	1
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved. 	1
The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places, and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic, and high deserts and low deserts. 	1
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be, I would've probably said, a couple of percent. 	1
So, perspective is everything and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about, I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. 	1
So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study, looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars. 	1
So to put the question a little more seriously, let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did, for spontaneous synchronization. 	1
Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize? 	1
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment. 	1
And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision, which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books, and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss, he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber. 	1
Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge. 	1
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school. 	1
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown. 	1
Well, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies. 	1
So that's when the Chinese moved in, saw a market opportunity and took over. 	1
Lem Sen: "I would've made this money, too, but I spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. 	1
 And they totally randomly take Chinese noodle dishes, and just ramenize them. 	1
They looked at "The Young and The Restless." It wasn't that, either. 	1
Basically, of those 110 people, 104 of them or so had gotten their number from a fortune cookie. 	1
I mean, fish don't know much about water, and people didn't know much about air. 	1
Something was missing, you know. I mean, these are -- it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that, but that was what was going on at the time. 	1
And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society, they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well. 	1
And, I mean -- this kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do -- now I, when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something -- you know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot, and my mother didn't really know much science, but I thought if you want to know something about stuff, 	1
And -- I -- I -- I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where there's a missile base. 	1
I hadn't heard about the 10 ways that we should be afraid of the -- By the way, I could have thought, I'd better not do this because they say not to, you know. 	1
But in the actual process, you get an idea -- like, when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides, and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA, you know, the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car, and then instead of going -- I went back and I did talk to people about it, 	1
You know -- and there is a lot --  There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened. 	1
And they got involved in it, and the scientific and industrial establishment was born, and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money, you know, because it was suddenly available. 	1
It's like, the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit, because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit. 	1
And -- anyone remember this workbook, "Instant Activities for Your Apple" -- free poster in each book? 	1
It's such a great way to -- I mean, they should make Java books like this, and we've have no problem learning a program. 	1
And when I saw this man's work, I realized how bad I was at design, or whatever I called it back then, and I suddenly had a kind of career goal, kind of in hot pursuit. 	1
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking, I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract. 	1
And so computers, as you know, these big computers, there are now tiny computers. 	1
However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose -- going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy, because the letters had told me, MIT forever. 	1
You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size? 	1
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we're going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. 	1
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds, and they're located in Northeastern Argentina. 	1
It's only been with us for less than a century, and in that time, that fourth dimension, when radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago, and we could actually tell how old some of these things were, is probably the most profound transformation, because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically. 	1
Many of you could ask the question, you know, why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately, a roadable aircraft, possible at this time? 	1
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that. 	1
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form. 	1
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is, the 100 series that's coming out, has to look like the 700 series, at the other end of their product line, so they need a distinct, coherent identity, which is BMW. 	1
We really approached it at the level of the typology of the building, where we could build these five separate towers, but they would all join at the 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass. 	1
But I think these are my sort of information highways: I live in much more of an analog world, where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange, and where I think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us. 	1
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week, and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response that I realized that design, that common design, that's in the public area means a lot to people, and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog. 	1
You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike: a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum. 	1
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities, looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature. 	1
Construction site in New York: red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such. 	1
enlightened urban planning and renewal, and I want to single out a place like Chicago, where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. 	1
These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names. 	1
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art, which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all, or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of "Inspired by Nature" -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him, 	1
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga" or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it, and that starts to develop flavor also. 	1
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we -- in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages. 	1
The first transformation -- and, by the way, the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else. 	1
I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort -- a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted. 	1
 But nonetheless, not just the Dutch, but everyone has this desire for the authentic. 	1
And what I responded to was, you know, Art Nouveau, or deco, or Victorian typography, or things that were just completely not Helvetica. 	1
And in the movie, he plays a down-and-out lawyer And he's taken on -- he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal, and in the midst of trying to connect the deal, he starts to empathize and identify with his client, and he regains his morality and purpose, and he goes on to win the case. 	1
So, this is sort of a comment on the time. 	1
And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position, and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity, it's the moment of serious play. 	1
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan, I didn't know what they were talking about, and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design, and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD. 	1
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. 	1
 So, a couple spreads from the book: here McLuhan says, "The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature." 	1
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. 	1
And we were trying to say that, hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK; some of them actually have friends and family, and they're not all awful people. 	1
So, if you look at a human genome, they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot. 	1
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA -- genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months. 	1
Well, actually, you could do it the other way. 	1
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness" as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand, for what this imaginary project could aspire to, not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. 	1
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux-based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project. 	1
Well, "Rare Earth" actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public. 	1
Well, the second part of that, soon after -- and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience, and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth." 	1
So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library, which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED, and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope, none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. 	1
There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope that has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace," in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right, but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out. 	1
Now, we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays, too, and the most well-remembered essay is one called "A Defence of Poetry." 	1
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. 	1
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much, I'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. 	1
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. 	1
And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps -- big, thick, five-ply wool socks on -- you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known. 	1
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta, I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes, without qualifying that word "athlete." 	1
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification, are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the Special Olympics, which deals with people with mental disabilities. 	1
I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years, you know? 	1
And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition? 	1
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want -- and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people. 	1
 It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel. 	1
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it. 	1
These sequences right up here -- which don't even code for protein, by the way -- are almost absolutely identical across all of these, so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses, without having to make something individual. 	1
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation; there's likely to be infection. 	1
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid, but that's what, you know, science is really good at. 	1
We learned to play the instruments, but we kind of had to come from within or go from within, because we didn't watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes, and farmed and played music, so we were able, I think, at a very critical age to develop our own style, our own self, and my mother plays, my father plays, 	1
Usually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today, with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many, many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes. 	1
Traditionally, concentrators look like this. 	1
So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around. 	1
So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator, which didn't work out for us, to optimize the Stirling engine, and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar, irrespective of weight, irrespective of size, to get the most conversion of solar energy, because the sun is free. 	1
You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house, you just save money with each incremental one you add. 	1
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. 	1
Well, what's the history of this disease? 	1
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well, and call them out, and find out what those techniques are. 	1
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. 	1
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff. 	1
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams." 	1
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill. 	1
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work. 	1
And this stuff is moving very quickly, and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight. 	1
The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. 	1
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances, and theirs might be as well. 	1
Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things. 	1
I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time, -- a little over 200 feet -- and, I had caught this little fish here. 	1
I'll get into why that is in just a minute. 	1
 So, we're down there, and this is at 400 feet -- that's looking straight up, by the way, so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is. 	1
Sure enough, I had caught one -- I just completely forgot that I had caught one.  And so this one we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to. 	1
If you look closely, you'll see there's a little white fish and gray fish that hangs out near them. 	1
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. 	1
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn. 	1
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table. 	1
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture. 	1
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup, where focus is so critical, but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company, thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side, and it ended up taking over not only the company, but my life for the next five or six years. 	1
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there. 	1
 -- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing. 	1
When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere. 	1
So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean. 	1
And right here guys, Silicon Valley, I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now? 	1
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at. 	1
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results. 	1
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better, and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ... 	1
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. 	1
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious about what they don't know, or don't understand, or is foreign to them. 	1
And I said, "Kids, really quickly -- I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house -- nothing too big, two or three stories -- but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character, anything you can dream up right now, what kind of legs would you build me?" 	1
Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long, but it's a fundamental part of the play scene. 	1
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility, which has limited the actual study of play. 	1
Those of you who remember Al Gore, during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency, may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person, at least in public. 	1
How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work, kind of like the Mozart metaphor, where, "Oh, MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence. 	1
How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you're developing? 	1
And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke -- now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ... 	1
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. 	1
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper, they came to us and said, "Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens." 	1
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought, maybe, yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull. 	1
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side, I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it -- it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal. 	1
Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it. 	1
And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet. 	1
And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight. 	1
They've got every feature known to man in there, because adding a new feature is just software. 	1
Here we go. And those are just the beginning. 	1
You know. It's just absolutely amazing. 	1
The really beautiful thing is, you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller. 	1
They went around to these carriers and said, "Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no. 	1
I'm sure at the time he did that, I didn't -- it didn't -- well, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind, it popped out years later. 	1
I used to say that when a game is over, and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome, I hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you. 	1
And I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA: to get an education, he was a good student, really knew why he was there in the first place. 	1
One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. 	1
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. 	1
 Wouldn't it be nice, I think, when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts, just a little, and violently blushes. 	1
"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"  And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day. 	1
And the process we made was not about changing the look, it was about improving the product completely. 	1
Why am I asking all of these business questions, instead of just showing them pages? 	1
JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked. One more question. 	1
It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. 	1
And I came home and I said to my father and mother, "I just met this man: doesn't have much work, and he's sort of ugly, funny voice, and he's a teacher at school. 	1
I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died. 	1
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics, we need to look at this in a rigorous way. 	1
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water. 	1
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well. 	1
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules -- which you saw -- but they're a little bit different. 	1
I hope when you learn things, like about how the natural world works -- I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child. 	1
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine. 	1
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place. 	1
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity. 	1
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you, I'm going to check my device." 	1
And then sort of through a process of wandering around, I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars, in a way that is convenient and affordable, you could get to a solution. 	1
Then we looked at the question of the affordability. 	1
 We then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands. 	1
We looked at an MIT study: ten million electric cars on the global roads. 	1
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale. 	1
You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL. 	1
We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe, but not to each other because we compete with each other all time. 	1
It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that. 	1
Some people are going to see this as an abomination, as the worst thing, as just awful. 	1
And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration. 	1
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya. 	1
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer." 	1
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs, is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry. 	1
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth. 	1
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs." 	1
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes. 	1
And when I was sitting in classes -- in which no one asked me to draw an airplane -- I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing. 	1
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas. 	1
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand, and Kentucky? 	1
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem." 	1
Moreover, as everyone knows, look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts. 	1
You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill, and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels. 	1
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath. 	1
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED. 	1
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else. 	1
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know, talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know. 	1
And they've inspired many characters as well. 	1
Everybody has come up to me and said, well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you. 	1
But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there. 	1
And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice. 	1
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily, we just have to know how to pull it out. 	1
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan, and we looked at Senegal. 	1
It's poking and prying with a purpose." 	1
That's the substrate that we're exploiting today, whether it's the internet, genetic engineering, laser scanners, guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition television, sensing, remote-sensing from space and the wonderful remote-sensing photos that we see in 3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker, and Enterprise, CD rewrite drives, flatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis, or Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs," which by the way was banned by the FCC, or ska, all of these things 	1
We've all been accused of being right-brained or left-brained at some point in time, depending on who we disagreed with.  You know, people say intuitive, you know that's like you're in touch with nature, in touch with yourself and relationships. 	1
You need both in life. Why do people do this? I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner, who's 70 years old so he can say this. He said, "It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence." 	1
And some of it is just the idea of creating media -- media as a sculpture, something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever-changing, by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. 	1
How many of you actually can make a bread in this way, without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor? 	1
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields, but in terms of the entire food network. 	1
You know, this is one of my favorite devices. 	1
And even being here -- I mean, the last few days, I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about. 	1
You know the expression, "Begging only gets you so far." 	1
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive. 	1
And she said, "Yeah, but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind." 	1
And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up. 	1
However, the record holder landed just shy of the eight-foot mark, which is impressive. 	1
And seen just recently in late 2008, here is that region again, now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. 	1
What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ... 	1
So here is the building; it looks rather unassuming, really. 	1
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off. 	1
These are not just crop plants, as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway -- fantastic work there. 	1
I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years. 	1
But look what happened in Europe after the plague: rising wages, land reform, technological innovation, birth of the middle class; and after that, forward-looking social movements like the Renaissance, and later the Enlightenment. 	1
If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices, the 10 secrets, the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness. 	1
Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot, Stickybot, using a new hierarchical dry adhesive. 	1
And if you look, you can see that it uses the toe peeling, just like the gecko does. 	1
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. 	1
Well we know that tails store fat, for example. 	1
And perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance. 	1
It actually uses its tail too, just like we saw in the lab. 	1
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic. 	1
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. 	1
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. 	1
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern, and television, radio, magazines, books, gave us the one-to-many pattern, the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern. 	1
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media. 	1
And in fact if you, or anyone you know, had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years, chances are it was done with one of these systems. 	1
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the Gates or the Soros or the Google. 	1
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days, we would be blogging, telling stories of, you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces, or we will burn. 	1
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled, that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds, because that's what it felt like. 	1
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves. 	1
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability, but an architecture that is full of tension, an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart, and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. 	1
When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles, of those lights, of those materials. 	1
You know, commonality, the first line in Charles' narration was, "The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States. From the sky, our cities look much the same." 	1
The other thing that's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design, they actually mean style. 	1
Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here. 	1
Well, again, the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at. 	1
So, for example, when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around, to selectively create a visual logic. 	1
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan, including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945. 	1
So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank But not just that, they actually banned money. 	1
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry. 	1
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana. 	1
By the way, this map from 2006 is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth from Europe, and they're finally getting out from under that. 	1
And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization. 	1
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were, "We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it." 	1
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses, and another doctor across from me. 	1
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years. 	1
And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about. 	1
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes. 	1
Because the problem there is just as severe, but it is more sinister, because vitamin D deficiency, from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation, is a major problem. 	1
For me they normally happen, these career crises, often, actually, on a Sunday evening, just as the sun is starting to set, and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow. 	1
According to how you answer that question, people are either incredibly delighted to see you, or look at their watch and make their excuses. 	1
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think, "This is somebody who's greedy." 	1
When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure, one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income, a loss of status. 	1
And when I say desktop, I don't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk. 	1
You know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all. 	1
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at, as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them. 	1
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin. 	1
 And now we've got to look to the future. 	1
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason to it. 	1
So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood. 	1
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations: cases where nations work together, in effect, de facto, the way China and Britain worked together to build, first a little enclave of the market model, and then scale it throughout China. 	1
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast. 	1
And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow." 	1
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle. 	1
But it was fascinating to me, because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers. 	1
This is a new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works. 	1
Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see, in what's called their bionic car. 	1
We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. 	1
Well now, my time is going, so I want to sing a song. 	1
When I got to law school, I didn't do very well. 	1
And at Google, as many of you know, about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20% time: things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News. 	1
They've pretty much set field exposure limits, which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines. 	1
So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know? 	1
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different. 	1
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play. 	1
You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear, but it's very important diversity. 	1
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that, but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity. 	1
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs, they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks, and it's founded above all on care, on relationships, on what people do to other people, often one to one, rather than simply selling them a product. 	1
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country, as well as a public service innovation lab. 	1
And what people are beginning to ask is: Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent, of our GDP, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled? 	1
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate. 	1
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. 	1
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air, and hopefully you make it look good. 	1
You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude. 	1
You can just see them there, popping open. 	1
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like. 	1
You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen. 	1
And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down, in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay. 	1
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche, the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic. 	1
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland, and we have repeat photography positions, that is places we just visit on an annual basis, in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia. 	1
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks, and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile, but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. 	1
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world, and show me just how fragile the world is. 	1
The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade. 	1
And I remember looking into the ice, and there were big chunks of white ice in there, and the water was completely black. 	1
That is, maybe you have a mind, and everyone else is just a really convincing robot. 	1
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring. 	1
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam. 	1
 And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. 	1
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. 	1
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures. 	1
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s, was seeing things, and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers or, because she was an old lady, whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's. 	1
And it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event, you have at one moment perfectly working YouTube. 	1
Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG. 	1
And you just bring your problems to the page. 	1
I know they look silly. And sure they look silly. 	1
And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on," but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online. 	1
Well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places. 	1
Right? So they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020. 	1
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. 	1
In this context I'll just show you a few. 	1
And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital. 	1
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. 	1
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe, and even a potentially Turkmen- Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well. 	1
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. 	1
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis. 	1
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star, which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. 	1
And for sure, in our case, our work started to look the same. 	1
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago, Jonathan Haidt, who defined his work into three different levels. 	1
We put a mask on it, looked at it deep down in the ground, checked it out from all sides, west, north, south, east, top and bottom. 	1
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services. 	1
And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination. 	1
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. 	1
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. 	1
I really don't want to just say "I'm great," because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends. 	1
Sorry.  Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi? 	1
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them. 	1
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that. 	1
Now, things changed when I discovered African books. 	1
I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. 	1
And instead of telling you, I'll just show you. 	1
We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk. 	1
It looks like they're going to green flowers. 	1
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace. 	1
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. 	1
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. 	1
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley. 	1
So I saw this remarkable map in a book. 	1
This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean. 	1
 There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. 	1
But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity, and its resilience, and its dependence on density and how we're connected together. 	1
And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. 	1
In the world of food we call it cooking. 	1
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay? 	1
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. 	1
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six, if you flip it over it looks like a nine. 	1
But this is both hysterically funny -- but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value. 	1
We're just packing in columns, so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions. 	1
You may be born lucky, where you know how to master your neocortical column, and you can play a fantastic symphony. 	1
Let me just talk about brands for a moment, because some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. 	1
So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy. 	1
And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. 	1
So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. 	1
In my book I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising. 	1
If you take the difference between these two images here, you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin. 	1
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6, and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. 	1
Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign." 	1
Our connection to reality is never just perception. 	1
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. 	1
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs. 	1
And I said to Professor Kurokawa, "Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down." 	1
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started. 	1
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. 	1
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. 	1
But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important. 	1
Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, 	1
And mom overheard us and said, "Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. 	1
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. 	1
He was just immediately caught with the situation. 	1
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. 	1
I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison, but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right? 	1
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. 	1
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier, about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed, by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies. 	1
Well, the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. 	1
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly"? 	1
I think it's worth the trouble because, again, it just helps us to understand. 	1
I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. 	1
And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of "democratization of intimacy." 	1
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people. 	1
And I would actually, I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it, and from where they're doing it, actually there is an incredible social transformation. 	1
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations? 	1
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. 	1
People become so engaged that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate. 	1
But actually, just the opposite is happening. 	1
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. 	1
 when this kind of technology merges with real life. 	1
And then look at the Indian classical dancer, the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,  And then look at business. 	1
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad." 	1
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better." 	1
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. 	1
When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room, John was just beside me, and was like, "Hmm. Hmm." 	1
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages, and she had a real breakthrough. 	1
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. 	1
Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. 	1
Well, let me first back up for a moment. 	1
I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay? 	1
So, that's just one use. Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses. 	1
Look here, 1858, India was here, China was here, Japan was there, United States and United Kingdom was richer over there. 	1
Can you see how it starts to move there? 	1
And you can see the two cats being here, China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know. 	1
And if I would also look at India, you have another type of inequity, actually, in India. 	1
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. 	1
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. 	1
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change. 	1
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are. 	1
Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. 	1
And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way, is to use some kind of sand catcher. 	1
Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes, as well as the potential for climate change? 	1
And yet, when the situation changes, you suddenly hear politicians talking as if, you know, for example, the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. 	1
I mean, the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak, it takes a very, very long time. 	1
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale. 	1
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources. 	1
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square, although we've looked at all of them. 	1
Second, we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact, and understand, maybe, the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work. 	1
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe. 	1
Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?" 	1
This was something really original. I got hooked. 	1
You know, you can do anything you want. 	1
It's a very small form, like a joke, a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form. 	1
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. 	1
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one. 	1
And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said. 	1
 When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, "Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises." 	1
And Jack Nicholson just says, "You make me want to be a better man." 	1
And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. 	1
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look. 	1
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson, and by the way, at one point I asked him, "Would you like to have met him?" 	1
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. 	1
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready. 	1
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. 	1
  So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. 	1
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty. 	1
They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. 	1
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics. 	1
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin, touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched. 	1
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time. 	1
So, using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often. 	1
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. 	1
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes, those brain cells die, they never come back. 	1
You go into the bars in Sardinia, instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar, you see the centenarian of the month calendar. 	1
In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. 	1
 Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival. 	1
We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we? 	1
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long. 	1
And the thing is, it's not just big industry. 	1
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each, and they are used for bear paw soup, and also being trained, later on, to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. 	1
And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus, who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets. 	1
And you know they're international because they put it "en Francais" as well. 	1
So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community. 	1
Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star. 	1
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden. 	1
You know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath. 	1
Okay. These are flat structures that we see here, the muscle. 	1
Just think about that, you know, wander through your life thinking about this. 	1
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about. 	1
And that's a project that is just about to open next week, the new home for the Dallas Theater Center, the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre. 	1
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. 	1
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium. 	1
But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24, they are they key, really, in the developing world, as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity. 	1
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. 	1
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. 	1
Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting -- it's not unique to diarrhea. 	1
Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked. 	1
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world. 	1
The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay? 	1
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website. 	1
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems. 	1
And we went around and we talked to people, and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know? 	1
So, it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things. 	1
That's about all you're going to get, because you can't use the usual sort of systems. 	1
It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes, and turns color, and all done with paper and carpet tape. 	1
You know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. 	1
One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine, where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer. 	1
Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for, it's usually to solve a question. 	1
If I throw a very concentric circle, or concentric ellipse, it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines, which get closer and closer together, which describes how gravity works. 	1
Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today? 	1
She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. 	1
But you know what? Her father, who was obese, died in her arms, And then the second most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. 	1
But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK? 	1
If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter. 	1
Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. 	1
And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat, but actually that's an assault, the one in blue. 	1
Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home. 	1
And so, I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out. 	1
My friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one, he says, "Technology is anything that doesn't work yet." 	1
Well, actually there is a reason: Environmental review has evolved into a process for any major project taking the better part of a decade, then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. 	1
They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. 	1
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better -- I hope so. 	1
You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI, and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending from the exercise, and how many you took in, if you go in and enter all the foods. 	1
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. 	1
OK. Now, if you want to understand autism, animals. 	1
You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind -- good at one thing, bad at something else. 	1
Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. 	1
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy, as I travel around and I do autism meetings, is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids, and they just aren't very social, and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science. 	1
OK, my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study. 	1
That's the kind of specificity you need. 	1
And I just want to thank everybody for coming. 	1
If you have a two, three or four year old you know, no speech, no social interaction, Don't wait, you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching. 	1
CA: Temple, can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED. 	1
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left, be it a real image or a synthetic image, it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column, regions of different colors, different luminances. 	1
Forget it, they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. 	1
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us, all the people who bought our work." 	1
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine, we just took it straight away, as is. 	1
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music. 	1
I got my name just because I was so young. 	1
Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity? 	1
 You didn't say, "That's a beautiful valley, but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches. 	1
Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well-being. 	1
There's nothing wrong with that, but just ask yourself, "Is this a journey I want to take? 	1
So, if you've been involved in that at all, I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing, whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!" 	1
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. 	1
So, what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan, something that could actually measure brain function? 	1
So, you know, that's my last message to you. 	1
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth." 	1
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape, with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective. 	1
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access. 	1
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie, and if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth. 	1
And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. 	1
When this picture appeared, that well-known scientific journal, The New York Times, wrote in its editorial, "Mars is uninteresting. 	1
This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. 	1
If you look at a long-term chart, prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong. 	1
You buy them cheaply, you use them, you crumple them up, and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. 	1
Well, amazingly, in places like India where costs are very low, that family, that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery -- so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery -- but the total cost, amortized across the rest of the work, was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. 	1
This is what liberation really looks like. 	1
We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. 	1
Take a look at this little girl who was one of the 28 children from all privileged schools, best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. 	1
And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside. 	1
First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. 	1
After all, take a look at these events: Imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W. Bush. 	1
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here. 	1
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta; she's a chick with a dick. 	1
I don't think anybody does it intentionally, but there were people there literally talking about, "Well, how much will they get?" 	1
You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body, just like a pendulum. 	1
So, even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this, really, we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot. 	1
The problem is they're just too expensive, tens of thousands of dollars. 	1
There are no tethers. It looks around, searches for the ball, looks around, searches for the ball, and it tries to play a game of soccer, autonomously: artificial intelligence. 	1
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope, and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. 	1
When she was 10 years old in 1927, she published her first book of poems called "The Janitor's Boy." 	1
♫ A right nice place, just fit for two ♫ ♫ Where we can live always. ♫ ♫ Oh, I'm in love with the janitor's boy, ♫ ♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫ he's busy as can be; ♫ ♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫ ♫ Out of an old settee. ♫ ♫ He'll carry me off, I know that he will, ♫ ♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫ 	1
The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world, but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography, images have provoked reactions in people, and those reactions have caused change to happen. 	1
Well, I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, "The Holocaust teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man, when he loses his moral compass and his reason." 	1
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room. 	1
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie -- this'll be interesting," and off we went. And we did, we made a movie, which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making, but it was a blast. I had so much fun. 	1
So they went on about their business and from a foot away, we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience. 	1
And you go back, and I'm at home, and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ... 	1
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini. 	1
You see these folks on television -- they never call anybody back from hell.  Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell. 	1
If they call back any of my friends, they're not going to... Well, you see the story. 	1
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost. 	1
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion, in which people can really speak their voice, especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic. 	1
You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing, in which one's starting not just from raw computation, but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge. 	1
On the one hand, we have Mathematica, with its sort of precise, formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines. 	1
Here we'll just create, in this line, a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there. 	1
This is just an example of one of these computable documents. 	1
Actually, I haven't shown these before, but here are a few of the candidate universes that I've looked at. 	1
I suppose what you mean is: What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping? 	1
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping. 	1
It was one of the worst feelings of my life, as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again. 	1
And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge. 	1
And it's like the traffic that you see. 	1
So that's the next layer of simplicity, and, in fact, integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they, in general, work really well. 	1
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets." 	1
Well, I think what part of the problem is that, in Haiti, although the problem is huge, somehow we understand it, it's localized. 	1
I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. 	1
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product, they told us all what they had. 	1
And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things: First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white. 	1
That picture on the left is just staggering to me. 	1
Is it that I analyze the data very well? 	1
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India. 	1
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. 	1
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books, for example, having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model. 	1
The other idea is kind of interesting, which is, you can't reach inside anymore. 	1
We're kind of software guys, and so nearly any problem that you pose, we like to try to solve with some software. 	1
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment, and let's think of what could happen if we could do that. 	1
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore. 	1
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism; and, basically, they just maintain their biomass. 	1
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. 	1
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation. 	1
I'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way. 	1
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it. 	1
 That's how you know you've baited the hook, right? 	1
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on. 	1
And she goes, "But I just can't understand it." 	1
And this is actually what it looks like, hundreds of blood vessels, all growing toward the center of the wound. 	1
It had already spread to his lymph nodes, so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip, and the oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside. 	1
It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. 	1
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina, let me just say, that I had never camped before. 	1
I'm just going to talk about two things. 	1
They're all coming in at this time, walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in. 	1
It's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions, because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell. 	1
And we can walk through the reasons for that, but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from, whereas the larger, faster-growing cell takes only two days. 	1
So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted, and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. 	1
Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking. 	1
But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative. 	1
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction. 	1
And that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration, so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry. 	1
It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look, you cannot copyright the sculptural design. 	1
These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers, listening to radio, reading any books If any child is found violating these rules, he is severely reprimanded. 	1
You took a pathogen, you modified it, you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened. 	1
When these mutate, they change their shape, and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore. 	1
Now, it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site, and as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on. 	1
CA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing? 	1
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point. 	1
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners. 	1
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here, remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement; it becomes an act of social creativity. 	1
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity; it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities -- social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. 	1
Okay, for a second example, think about this cultural hero, icon on the Left, creator of this character. 	1
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps, inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon. 	1
Let's just come down a bit and fly around. 	1
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers? 	1
But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well, things that I don't think most people realize. 	1
So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days, but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy, largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. 	1
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph. 	1
For example, these fish predate on sea urchins, and when the fish were all gone, all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins. 	1
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... 	1
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago, and that was the Time 100 poll. 	1
CA: Love and peace were mentioned, kind of with quote marks around them, right? 	1
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa, which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick. 	1
Well, actually, many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness, the economic impact of Apollo. 	1
This is a beautiful quote that I found -- we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming: "When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic." 	1
Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera. 	1
And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine. 	1
So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like. 	1
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. 	1
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times. 	1
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go, and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass." 	1
♫ Especially when you're already getting yours ♫ ♫ Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend ♫ ♫ Well don't go blaming the kids again ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ Let it go ♫ 	1
 Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough. 	1
He said, that's what flutes are for -- to be played well. 	1
What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right, the justice, of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf. 	1
And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, said he had read all about the history of golf, and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible, and that walking was not essential, but incidental. 	1
Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you." 	1
Because it was wartime, the British .303 rifle was just all over the whole country. 	1
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there. 	1
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. 	1
But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions. 	1
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model. 	1
Now, from an environmental standpoint, the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal, the two major sources of electricity. 	1
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff. 	1
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler. 	1
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone. 	1
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch. 	1
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines, our pattern-seeking brain processes, to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to. 	1
Girl: Yes.  Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips, the texture, right, and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not. 	1
This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file, plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. 	1
But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins the dolphins will start whistling, they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group, wait for the boat to go by, and then they'll get back to normal business. 	1
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at. 	1
The biologists continued to be skeptical of the long-range communication issue well past the '70s, until the end of the Cold War. 	1
I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls. 	1
She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic. 	1
Well, biologists went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say, "Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground. 	1
We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us, and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial, we could change everything in the world that is a problem today. 	1
And he's like, "Well, we don't need one." 	1
And he said, "Yes, that's my wife's car." And I said, "Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer." 	1
That doesn't make any sense." You just figure out a way to make more money faster. 	1
Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now, all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said, "Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?" 	1
[Kid ... "And you thought you could do anything?"] [You still can.] [Because a lot of what we consider impossible ...] [... is easy to overcome] [Because in case you haven't noticed, we live in a place where] [One individual can make a difference] [Want proof?] [Just look at the people who built our country;] [Our parents, grandparents, our aunts, uncles ...] [They were immigrants, newcomers ready to make their mark] 	1
[design tools to help you ...] [... stay connected with friends, family and colleagues around the world.] [And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.] [Do you know an entrepreneur?] [Entrepreneurs can be anyone ...] [Even ... you!] [So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted] [Help heal the economy] [Make a difference.] [Take your business to new heights.] [But most importantly,] [remember when you were a kid ...] 	1
That very human lesson, more than 20 years ago, served me well during the last economic downturn we had. 	1
For the next three dozen years as king, this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including, just recently, taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed, no coup. 	1
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living," and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want; instead, it's about wanting what you have. 	1
So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force. 	1
And so if you ask this question: Where would you look to see the future of education? 	1
When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull, not push. 	1
And they all treat learning, not as some sort of academic, analytical activity, but as that's something that's productive, something you make, something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from. 	1
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school, they're in family and community, what you also need, definitely, is more on the right hand side. 	1
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. 	1
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia. 	1
Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods. 	1
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know. 	1
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us: molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies. 	1
But what you see here is the result of, actually, internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden. 	1
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this. 	1
And just in closing, I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. 	1
To the right, I took a higher roughness. 	1
Well, these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did. 	1
For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me because they could do it much, much easier. 	1
But of course, you know at the U.N., sometimes things move slowly, and they basically said no. 	1
And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate, it's really important to look at them as one system. 	1
But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down, that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. 	1
If you look around at the birds, there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year, but then leave. 	1
And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. 	1
It would not take an awful lot to anticipate in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil, oil might start coming out of one of them. 	1
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817. 	1
You know, I think it's probably millions. 	1
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills. 	1
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. 	1
Because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom-up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. 	1
You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it. 	1
When we look for information online, we basically have two strategies. 	1
The other children asked me about the movie "Midnight Express," which I had not seen; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked, because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers, and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair. 	1
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election. 	1
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. 	1
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables. 	1
But there are legitimate secrets -- you know, your records with your doctor; that's a legitimate secret -- but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated. 	1
CA: So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government. 	1
But do you see any irony in the fact that, in order for you to shine that light, you have to, yourself, create secrecy around your sources? 	1
I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with, so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff, and then lower security cases. 	1
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone, you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers, okay. 	1
And he controls them from the top down -- whereas when they work for the other side, eventually, when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated, they actually, each one has a different, colorful kind of dress. 	1
DNA analysis, one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started, was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. 	1
Finally, 15 years ago, the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star, and we actually did pretty well. 	1
We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. 	1
From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you, where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth, and we hope to meet in the middle one day. 	1
Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go. 	1
And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton, bumping into, you know, little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores, the herring kind of fish. 	1
And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high-definition video, because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to 10 stereo HD systems running continuously and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land. 	1
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. 	1
First problem is just, well, where should we start? 	1
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. 	1
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. 	1
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy. 	1
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. 	1
and that's what the monkey can for a single token. 	1
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. 	1
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. 	1
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. 	1
It's not just about population, and it's not just about them; it's about us. 	1
But they're not just buying the juice; they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe. 	1
And I'll just say two things about this. 	1
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to. 	1
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese, Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour, has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs. 	1
And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes, because you think, you know, other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact: what I do, where I do it, when I do it. 	1
It's something that people don't do very well. 	1
There are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status? 	1
Then of course, the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003. And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to 3,000 billion. 	1
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. 	1
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that. 	1
So we can use this new kind of language, if you like, to alter our perspective or change our views. 	1
So some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book. 	1
They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x-ray vision. 	1
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right? 	1
Then he meets the yeti crab, the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find -- and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it. 	1
This is what I love about comic strips, you know. 	1
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. 	1
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions -- I'm just saying that, when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards, you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate, or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. 	1
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out, and we realized it was okay. 	1
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. 	1
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil, but on the other hand, the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work, generally in a fairly crummy car. 	1
If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids, they might have three jobs or more, and then they have to really commute. 	1
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road, this is where we need to be. 	1
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing, and you can find more about this policy. 	1
With this whole sort of suite of policies, we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020. 	1
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use. 	1
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average. 	1
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it. 	1
Now, as if this was not enough -- to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet -- we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states, separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram, where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. 	1
TD: So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well-being, or deep sense of well-being as humans, and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now. 	1
What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi, living on the remote island of Yakushima. 	1
So what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen, and this is around 3,000 years old and lives in Greenland, which is a long way to go for some lichens. 	1
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. 	1
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think, because it is just so unusual. 	1
It also has a friend nearby -- well, I think they're friends. 	1
So we have an ironic problem -- good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. 	1
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa. 	1
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?" 	1
So I said, "Well, how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing?" 	1
So here, what happened then, you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself. 	1
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because, knowingly or unknowingly, whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here. 	1
When I realized this, and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars, and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there, weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council, I thought, this is wrong. 	1
You know, they were marginalized in the negotiation room. 	1
We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. 	1
And just so you know, 1982-'83, that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. 	1
So, Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year: "The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release." 	1
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. 	1
And if you can get that wheel to turn, look out. 	1
I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. 	1
I mean, today, one person speaking can be seen by millions, shedding bright light on potent ideas, creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case, intense desire to laugh. 	1
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. 	1
And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. 	1
Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. 	1
What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact, or a known fact, about social networks, which goes like this: Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do? 	1
And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. 	1
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts, like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding, everything that's cooled in the supermarket, there's gelatin to make it look good. 	1
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one, because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts." 	1
It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched, and we're in Laurel Maryland, at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. 	1
And it's Monday morning, and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. 	1
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office, and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now. 	1
And they said, "Jeez, you know, we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away. 	1
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses. 	1
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now. 	1
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. 	1
It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here." 	1
The self is just our operation center, our consciousness, our moral compass. 	1
They extend long and delicate branches, and in short, they look like trees. 	1
Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book. 	1
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain. 	1
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering. 	1
But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake. 	1
They were well-known in the community, they knew that customers were always right, and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves. 	1
We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom. 	1
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. 	1
This is what it looks like, essentially, this credit and debt system, just for the U.K. 	1
This is a kind of agenda, which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma, because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. 	1
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. 	1
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna. 	1
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer, and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning. 	1
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. 	1
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you. 	1
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift. 	1
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal, of every kind of creature that moves, but no mention about plants. 	1
In another part of the same story, all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark, so birds, livestock and wild animals. 	1
Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. 	1
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature, but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye. 	1
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist. 	1
What's the --  How did you know that? They did. 	1
♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ ♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ ♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫ ♫ you gonna have to send me home ♫ ♫ 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ Now you might not be able to sing that out loud, but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are. 	1
This is kind of like something I used to do  So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. 	1
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try. 	1
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job, and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety." 	1
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. 	1
We make it really, really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. 	1
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have, the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them, to gather them to make this happen. 	1
So if we think about this unleashing human potential, which was possible by cooking and food, why do we talk so badly about food? 	1
We have a coctivor's opportunity, because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward -- quite sophisticated to cook -- to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves. 	1
So I would say, coquo ergo sum: I cook, therefore I am. 	1
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. 	1
 You know, these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. 	1
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. 	1
Time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars. 	1
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. 	1
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. 	1
But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. 	1
And biological pest control, by the way, or these good bugs that we are talking about, they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years, for a long, long time. 	1
And this kind of a world, this vast flying beast you can ride around, shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. 	1
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do, but in a game we can just say, "Right, well. 	1
And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards, then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. 	1
Well, what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that, after you drop your vote into the ballot box. 	1
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain, because that's all there was to look at. 	1
But we got up there, and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive? 	1
Here's this resource that we're looking to save, and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record. 	1
It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases, it's hard to get well, you might die, but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better. 	1
There's no high-tech gizmos here, just biology revealed through biology. 	1
This is the first ever such experiment, sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. 	1
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit. 	1
A long time ago, by a people who look like me, by wasichu, eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. 	1
between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you? 	1
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to. 	1
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and I ride with them tomorrow also. 	1
Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. 	1
So we had some good ideas: we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. 	1
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet. 	1
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. 	1
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. 	1
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. 	1
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going? 	1
So I'm going to talk about work; specifically, why people can't seem to get work done at work, which is a problem we all kind of have. 	1
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago, so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there? 	1
The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together, and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- to say, "Hey look, we're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting. 	1
There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove, if you like to cook -- cool stove. 	1
Well, if that ruins your life, well then you shouldn't live there. 	1
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well. 	1
 Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange. 	1
Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective. 	1
And he had the wherewithal to say, he said, "You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that, but right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. 	1
And so that happens in the building industry as well. 	1
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? 	1
Well, the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East, of a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels. 	1
The youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two. 	1
And so my question is -- yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East, but let's also take a look at the story. 	1
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. 	1
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? 	1
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. 	1
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. 	1
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. 	1
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. 	1
 Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first. 	1
Basically a restaurant just like any other. 	1
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. 	1
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. 	1
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -- same chairs, same tables. 	1
By the way, the pronunciation is "Eyjafjallajokull." 	1
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. 	1
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? 	1
But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. 	1
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.  	1
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate. 	1
And look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men. 	1
And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. 	1
The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs. 	1
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect. 	1
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? 	1
The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. 	1
But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. 	1
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. 	1
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history. 	1
And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. 	1
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. 	1
Hands up -- how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? 	1
Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? 	1
There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. 	1
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. 	1
And he looked at me, and he said, "Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom." 	1
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. 	1
And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake. 	1
But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer. 	1
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. 	1
To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts. 	1
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. 	1
And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. 	1
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. 	1
 So there is among many people -- certainly me and most of the people I talk to -- a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working, with the way our institutions run. 	1
But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. 	1
What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason -- namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. 	1
These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. 	1
The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes, yet even he called the Koran "as toilsome reading as I ever undertook, a wearisome, confused jumble." 	1
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. 	1
Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report. 	1
But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression. 	1
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. 	1
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL, he started joining clubs. 	1
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about." 	1
The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. 	1
Instead of giving in to grief, depression, defeat in the face of that violence, Mairead hooked up with Betty -- a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic -- and they took to the streets to say, "No more violence." 	1
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. 	1
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it." 	1
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science -- well, steel comes from iron, so I phoned up an iron mine. 	1
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever. 	1
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest. 	1
Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S. 	1
Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test. 	1
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities the kind of "otherizing" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. 	1
You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun? 	1
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do, or not to do, Now as you know, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?" 	1
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. 	1
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus. 	1
But his -- well, the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. 	1
Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay. 	1
So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. 	1
I have this pen, and I look at the data, and I move the pen towards the head, and all of a sudden I feel resistance. 	1
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners, that just in 0.3 seconds, I can scan the whole heart, and I can do that with time resolution. 	1
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery, and do that with high-quality resolution data. 	1
So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. 	1
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. 	1
I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, "The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe." 	1
And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts. 	1
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. 	1
Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us? 	1
So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. 	1
So let me just spool it out a little bit. 	1
So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. 	1
They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch. 	1
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice." 	1
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk, because that's where love comes from." 	1
 But he's a literary agent, which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. 	1
My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge, and during the year and a half I was on crutches, it became a sort of symbol to me. 	1
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. 	1
In that very short learning curve, you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record. 	1
Without getting a little too extreme about this, imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene, more healthy, burn off stress -- where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore, where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again. 	1
But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. 	1
Kismet:  Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. 	1
We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. 	1
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore. 	1
And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts. 	1
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other. 	1
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. 	1
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not. 	1
I want you to take a look at this baby. 	1
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available. 	1
WhipCar, which started April of last year, it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service. 	1
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur, I look at things as platforms. 	1
 I would just like to say that one of the big things, when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other, but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation, is by sharing failures. 	1
Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. 	1
It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. 	1
Now of course, in medical application, that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably, your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. 	1
And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage, they pause for just a moment, and they leave something in an enzyme for a second, and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. 	1
And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. 	1
CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community, TEDxCairo, are meeting as we speak. 	1
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine. 	1
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project." 	1
And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. 	1
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone. 	1
"He choked on a pile of hash" -- that was their answer: "He's a criminal. 	1
It really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations -- health care, where innovation makes it more expensive, early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you, and just generosity -- that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over time, that you've got a problem. 	1
And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem. 	1
Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. 	1
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off. 	1
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used. 	1
When I was just a little girl, my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world. 	1
So often, particularly at a young age, we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life, and sometimes they're in our own kitchens, talking on the phone, making us dinner, doing all that keeps the world going around and around. 	1
And I started putting the first YouTube videos up, really just as a kind of nice-to-have, just kind of a supplement for my cousins, something that might give them a refresher or something. 	1
They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other. 	1
These kids aren't using textbooks, or getting one-size-fits-all lectures. 	1
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. 	1
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education. 	1
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did. 	1
This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. 	1
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years, it's looked like this in the summer. 	1
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for. 	1
And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand. 	1
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience. 	1
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. 	1
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us? 	1
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group. 	1
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design. 	1
You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house, so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. 	1
The poem was very indignant, and mainly exaggerated, but the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant, so I thought that's what was expected of me. 	1
The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home, and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. 	1
It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you, but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions, you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers, or your community, who will listen. 	1
When my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old, but I took my mom by the hand and told her, "Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby." 	1
And me? Well, neither do I, but I see the impossible every day. 	1
What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends, without any real advanced analysis, to 2050, there are two things that can increase the energy use. 	1
They've created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot. 	1
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog. 	1
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. 	1
And, in fact, it took about 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form. 	1
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe. 	1
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls." 	1
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know. 	1
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. 	1
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately. 	1
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them, I'm now leading a force that's dispersed, and I've got to use other techniques. 	1
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing. 	1
And having that kind of relationship, for me, turned out to be critical at many points in my career. 	1
And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see, it's kind of difficult -- it really is. 	1
But can I just tell you, the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. 	1
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. 	1
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch going, "I know what I'm going to do. 	1
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers, it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations. 	1
And I'll give you some examples of what I mean. 	1
He decided to tell it to me and I made a book, from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later. 	1
All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge, and at night, when no one was looking, he'd put his experience to practice. 	1
Believe me, he didn't mean this as -- anyway, let me just read it. 	1
I mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. 	1
Man, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade. 	1
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air. 	1
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements? 	1
She uses smart boards, she blogs, she Tweets, she does Facebook, she does all this sort of high-tech stuff. 	1
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. 	1
The parents were looking in the window. 	1
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country, and he says, "Yes." 	1
And the line of black dots that you see in the background, that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. 	1
And it was very obvious that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth, we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards, because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. 	1
We can have both models in our head simultaneously, right, that kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together, right, the cognitive dissonance. 	1
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured. 	1
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. 	1
It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats. 	1
And this is the other one -- that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts. 	1
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape, nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner, so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here. 	1
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me. 	1
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside. 	1
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it. 	1
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium. 	1
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton -- they were absolute; they just stuck there forever. 	1
I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo." 	1
The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. 	1
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent. 	1
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them, and the numbers don't do it justice though. 	1
So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. 	1
The animal will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights. 	1
Now I want to close on one story, which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control, can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic. 	1
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras. 	1
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. 	1
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter, create one composition. 	1
So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral. 	1
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. 	1
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain. 	1
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing. 	1
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles. 	1
This looks like a plant, but it's actually an animal. 	1
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock, it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume, changing color as it goes, from green to blue. 	1
What you're looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a 24-hour period. 	1
As you know, an animation is a series of images. 	1
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days, but it's not true. 	1
And then they can track them, and at the end of the day, they look and see, did these guys get every single street, every single house. 	1
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down. 	1
So Europe is not just an example now to emulate; it's an enemy to fight and to resist. 	1
 Okay, last question -- harder question -- when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case, should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework, or should we use a Millian consequentialist one? 	1
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. 	1
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples. 	1
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park." 	1
 A friend of mine, a colleague of mine, Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms. 	1
But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing. 	1
And so what we're looking for is that gene. 	1
I know John's story very well because I'm John. 	1
But now that we're switching to merging medical data, making it available electronically, we can crowd source that information, and now as a physician, I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device. 	1
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game. 	1
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy. 	1
And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth, we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques. 	1
Jansky had made a historic discovery, that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves. 	1
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle; it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. 	1
And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke. 	1
So this is just like a crossword puzzle, except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it. 	1
You know, there's two ways you can make a product. 	1
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures. 	1
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like. 	1
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles. 	1
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing. 	1
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long. 	1
Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes. 	1
That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke. 	1
And I'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed. 	1
And we have his book outside in the bookshop. 	1
What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here. 	1
Well my personal story, my personal journey, what brings me to the TED stage here today, is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in Muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond. 	1
So as I said, we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it. 	1
Anecdotally, we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor, well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia. 	1
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here. 	1
PM: I don't think so.  NA: But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society. 	1
NA: As you know, the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered, veiled women. 	1
NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years, has been through so much. 	1
And I just wanted to share with you: there's one reporter that came. 	1
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information. 	1
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit. 	1
You just have to believe me, it is, it is. 	1
Well in most cases it never gets this far. 	1
at not having a self that fit, and the confusion that came from my self being rejected, created anxiety, shame and hopelessness, which kind of defined me for a long time. 	1
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth." 	1
But if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. 	1
And what you see here, or what you don't really see normally, is that these are the physics of culture. 	1
So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -- throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -- all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. 	1
And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration between nature and man. 	1
   So we can now look at the SmartBird. 	1
Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year, you drown everything. 	1
I must say, many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like, but let's talk about it. 	1
So is that just another version of this? 	1
This is just the weight versus the age. 	1
The bigger you are systematically, according to very well-defined rules, less energy per capita. 	1
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals. 	1
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon. 	1
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics, but underlying this is the social networks, because this is a universal phenomenon. 	1
How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk, but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk -- to think they taste better? 	1
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil, because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years, when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. 	1
And sound places us in time as well, because sound always has time embedded in it. 	1
These are just some of the listening positions, or scales of listening positions, that you can use. 	1
And you see, even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver. 	1
And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again. 	1
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift, picks them up, smiles and walks off. 	1
And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, they're not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air. 	1
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated. 	1
I won't show you very many graphs today, but if I can just focus on this one for a moment, it really tells us a lot of what we need to know -- which is, quite simply, that if you look, for example, at transportation, a major category of climate emissions, there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air. 	1
And this is a huge, huge energy savings, because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars. 	1
And we know from follow-up studies that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins, and bred nearly as successfully. 	1
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go." 	1
And then we went home. We'd sort of done it. 	1
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time. 	1
Center: It's just what I've always wanted. 	1
They are what we just said -- facial features, hair structure, skin color. 	1
So our work, in a certain way, is to address this imago, this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe. 	1
And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way. 	1
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours, once we've set up the right chemistry. 	1
Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff. 	1
I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. 	1
And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers. 	1
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. 	1
And perhaps because of its size, a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it. 	1
I mean, if they have the same mutation, and they get this genetic test and they understand it, then they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early, and potentially live a significantly longer life. 	1
OK, so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child. 	1
Now this time on TV you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke," you have "Andy Griffith," you have domestic shows all about comfort. 	1
So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. 	1
 Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this, synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process. 	1
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon, which has just accelerated this huge shift, which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. 	1
ELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. 	1
These authors have been striving to write books. 	1
What we're left with is a collection of five million books, 500 billion words, a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which, when written out, would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over -- a veritable shard of our cultural genome. 	1
He'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve, but some thrived." 	1
And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. 	1
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. 	1
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. 	1
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania, which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. 	1
What I've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes. 	1
 ♫ I don't understand myself, ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫ ♫ if they come near me, ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫ ♫ I don't understand myself, ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic, ♫ ♫ that no one withstands, ♫ ♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫ ♫ But if the red light is on ♫ 	1
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei -- 20 years old, beautiful. 	1
So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage. 	1
And he told me, "Biosignatures, we need to look for a biosignature." 	1
And if I look at French texts, it looks a little bit different, or Italian or German. 	1
and then look for large deviations from this -- this thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there." 	1
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics. 	1
And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting achievement. 	1
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person. 	1
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program. 	1
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature? 	1
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. 	1
I thought, well what the hell's that about? 	1
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things, just something that's exquisitely beautiful, that's universally beautiful. 	1
You all, I guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. 	1
So this is where the mouse came from as well. 	1
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990. 	1
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives. 	1
Well guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying. 	1
But when you see clusters of them, that's your signal. 	1
What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor. 	1
So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code. 	1
And in a traditional American funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive. 	1
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food. 	1
I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms, so I formed the Decompiculture Society, a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options, seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom. 	1
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years. 	1
Absolutely to the last inch, they can make that cooker. 	1
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran. 	1
Each of us, every day, need just eight glasses of this, because we're human. 	1
He's just a saint of a man -- 54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder. 	1
First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle, then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up. 	1
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society. 	1
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. 	1
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us. 	1
But look at the scale of the differences. 	1
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality. 	1
If you go to the Pentagon, they will say, "You know what, now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft." 	1
And on the animal on the right, you see that the cancer was responding. 	1
What we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent, motivated, enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide. 	1
I want to leave you with just two ideas. 	1
So artist books have a lot of definitions. 	1
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with? 	1
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. 	1
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? 	1
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. 	1
And you know, some of my friends have always said, "Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this? 	1
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done. 	1
But I countered, "Well men's brains make this too. 	1
And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows. 	1
Either no time delay, in which case light would just tickle your palm, or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second. 	1
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research? 	1
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so, science has kind of blurred this distinction between non-living and living systems, and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. 	1
Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a kind of synthetic biology: "The synthesis of life, should it ever occur, will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea." 	1
Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. 	1
And we just put these two together in the same system. 	1
So the way this works is, you have a simple system of five chemicals here, a simple system here. When they hybridize, you then form something that's different than before, it's more complex than before, and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication. 	1
But again, these are done in these primordial conditions, really messy conditions, not sort of sterile laboratory conditions. 	1
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement. 	1
But it doesn't really need it, because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up. 	1
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume. 	1
And here you're looking at a model that's extracted from the cloud of points for Stirling Castle. 	1
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves. 	1
BG: What kind of training do you do, you personally, for that? 	1
YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters, it's not such a big problem with oxygen. 	1
So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010. 	1
He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer, the window person, the painter, the floor person. 	1
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems. 	1
But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human. 	1
You may well have your own children and think, "Oh no, my child's best." 	1
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book. 	1
It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. 	1
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system. 	1
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked. 	1
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers. 	1
So the thought that I would like to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad, we can begin to look at them as blessings, magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go. 	1
Now the other issue comes with, not just the ability to tell pitches apart, but the ability to tell sounds apart. 	1
And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness, which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there. 	1
OK, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet, you look at the crystal ball. 	1
Well, the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. 	1
It was on Tahrir square, where the international community was constantly frightened that, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution. 	1
So, I mean, these are the things you can do. 	1
And though young people from the Arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators, shaking the region, kind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco to do substantial reforms, it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome. 	1
And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school. 	1
It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. 	1
And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors -- for example, the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make. 	1
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries, that provide fish for the poor, that answer is more like $11,000. 	1
So we take a carrot cake, put it in a blender, and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice, and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream, I guess, and it comes off looking like, you know, Jupiter's floating around your plate. 	1
Instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn't eat, we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know. 	1
And basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients. 	1
And then they had to figure out: "Well she needs furniture. 	1
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it." 	1
And even more -- and this is something that one can be really amazed about -- is what I'm going to show you next, which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections, real pathways. 	1
You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. 	1
And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps, can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around, which is the association cortex, where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making. 	1
This is so specific that, for example, if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem, if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example, what you get is coma or vegetative state, which is a state, of course, in which your mind disappears, your consciousness disappears. 	1
It's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem, there are, to make it simple, all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior, different aspects of our body. 	1
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe -- and I could be wrong, but I don't think I am -- that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings -- primordial feelings, by the way. 	1
And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior. 	1
It's not telling you which way to put the slider, it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self. 	1
to see how people might look if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun, if they gain weight and so on. 	1
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image. 	1
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion. 	1
You know, when you want to forget, you don't want to see things, so you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside and say, "That's enough." 	1
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times. 	1
I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading, surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words. 	1
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. 	1
The situation, to be honest, is very serious. 	1
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was, look, if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends, that is not a crime. That's okay. 	1
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. 	1
You can just make it physically on the spot. 	1
I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. 	1
Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. 	1
I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves. 	1
So deep in the middle of that picture, you see a classic pick-pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. 	1
If I need it, I'll call you, otherwise just stand there. 	1
And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online, you break it open and the goo is in there, you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. 	1
It takes good equipment and well-trained, dedicated soldiers. 	1
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. 	1
He took one part from here and another from there, and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing. 	1
One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. 	1
And so the suggestion is, well hey, if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this, maybe it would be a good idea, again, with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person, again, they haven't actually killed them. 	1
It's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray. 	1
So obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking a them and saying, "Hey, these things could be really useful." 	1
Now I remember a few years ago, a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here, president of Qatar University -- who, by the way, is a woman -- he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way. 	1
Well that's not true, but we'll get to the goose in a minute. 	1
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. 	1
It looks like it could still get bigger. 	1
So it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is. 	1
But for the men here, I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk. 	1
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because, women, we care a great deal about being thin and good looking, whereas men mostly care about sex ... 	1
But just in case, I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon. 	1
There was someone recently, wasn't there? Just a couple weeks ago. 	1
We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky. 	1
And we would use conventional methods -- I have a crossbow, you see the crossbow in my hand there, which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well. 	1
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like where people have access to mobile smart devices. 	1
SemCrude, just one of the licensees, in just one of their tailings ponds, dumps 250,000 tons of this toxic gunk every single day. 	1
Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire, I mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity. 	1
And just like that, you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses. 	1
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work, you should really Google him -- Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground, where finally the other kid says to him, "Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad," to which Hicks replies, "Really? How soon?" 	1
That software has to receive and decode the radio signal, and then figure out what to do with it, even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio, and that software that does that decoding, if it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car. 	1
These are ones where I went to a conference, and my mind was just blown, and I said, "I have to share this with other people." 	1
Now, we've all looked at smartphones upside down. 	1
Well, from that discussion grew this program that involved 2,700 scientists from more than 80 countries around the world who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions at a combined cost of 650 million dollars to study the distribution, diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean. 	1
So when I say full, I mean really full -- well past any margin for error, well past any dispute about methodology. 	1
We tend to look at the world, not as the integrated system that it is, but as a series of individual issues. 	1
You see, those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem, that technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good, are in fact right. 	1
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels, just switching channel after channel, and then suddenly you actually stop on one. 	1
It's not just that they're damn cute; it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are. 	1
In our earliest days at Pixar, before we truly understood the invisible workings of story, we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts. 	1
I could just tell there was a grand design under it -- in every shot, every scene, every line. 	1
I want to talk about those looking for great jobs, great careers, and why you're going to fail. 	1
And then, of course, another excuse: "Well, I would do this, I would do this, but, but -- well, after all, I'm not weird. 	1
 Okay, here's another question: Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand. 	1
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria. 	1
Okay, so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way. 	1
Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. 	1
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable think, "God, vulnerability is weakness." 	1
  And she looks back and does this, "I know." 	1
And she said, "We watched your TED talk in my book club. 	1
And to get out from underneath it -- to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other. 	1
Because the personal, as you know, is political. 	1
And one of the things that you see is that male line, the mortality is going down, down, down, down, down. 	1
She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had. 	1
Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative that went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, which is the cardiology part of the NIH. 	1
Some women have those heart attacks, but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack, where it erodes, doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle, EKG findings are different -- female-pattern. 	1
I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house, because the mice might get into them and start a fire. 	1
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice, and that this is how things should work. 	1
You see, the battery is the key enabling device here. 	1
Perhaps overlooked, Volta's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor. 	1
So let's abandon the paradigm of let's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product. 	1
I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me. 	1
Now, the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University, the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard, and wrote the word "Apple" underneath, and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up." 	1
And then I just threw some typography on it. 	1
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it. 	1
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of. 	1
  All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together. 	1
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence, sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers. 	1
Well, again and again, what we find as we look around the world in our little tour of the world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops. 	1
Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen? 	1
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me, "Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food, local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills -- and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here, but not any one of these is a silver bullet. 	1
And I think we need to look at it, though, from a different lens. 	1
And I thought it was just an amazing day. 	1
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine by the Zionist organization to look at areas for Jewish settlement and acquire land for Jewish settlement. 	1
And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right. 	1
Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality, and this peculiar number may be doing just that, as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes -- an idea that naturally emerges from string theory, which takes me to part two: string theory. 	1
It's a compelling picture, a kind of cosmic symphony, where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little, tiny strings can play. 	1
And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they're so cold that, again, our form of life would not take hold. 	1
Because today's astronomers, by turning powerful telescopes to the sky, have captured a handful of starkly informative photons -- a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. 	1
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game. 	1
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience. 	1
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side. 	1
You see, fire made us human; fossil fuels made us modern. 	1
So to solve the energy problem, we just needed to enlarge it. 	1
RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation -- like literally two raindrops falling, and just watching that pattern is so stunning. 	1
Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement. 	1
 In the 10th century, little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune. 	1
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype. 	1
It's from a family of errors actually -- a whole set of relationship errors, which, when I started digging into them, it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor. 	1
So my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just stink more than she does. 	1
Now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing, because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin, but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed. 	1
Why? Because they are just like the CIA. 	1
And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie. 	1
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay, but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so. 	1
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability. 	1
I think the logic goes something like this: If we don't expect greatness, if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful, well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen. 	1
But if you're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly, but then adjusts a parachute to your back just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned, you will soar like an eagle, even if you're just a penguin. 	1
Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular. 	1
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000. 	1
And at one point, one of the girls who was sitting at his table, seeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him, "That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse." 	1
So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have. 	1
And so I went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time, which I'm very interested in. 	1
He had developed this way, this kind of methodology, that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time. 	1
So I thought one of the things I'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like. 	1
And when they come, they say, "Okay, you're going to go into the pirate ship, but be very still because we don't want the pirates to find you." 	1
So I looked in the book for the most difficult move, and it was this. 	1
I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony. 	1
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book. 	1
This is called synchrotron radiation, and it's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing. 	1
And they know what she looks like because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere. 	1
If, however, the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed, the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for Egypt, but for the entire region. 	1
The signs don't look good, some have said. 	1
They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. 	1
We will know that we're not that miracle, right, that we're just another duck in a row, we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn. 	1
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc, okay? 	1
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science, obviously biology, obviously astronomy, but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of, "We're looking for E.T." 	1
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know, I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff. 	1
Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle looking up at me with big eyes, and I started, there was a white board behind me, and I started off by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said, "All right, now look, this is the number of stars in the visible universe, and this number is so big there's not even a name for it." 	1
And the reason was, because when I was asked to do this, I'd just read, in one of the papers, I can't remember, something from someone at Facebook saying, well, "we need to make everybody use their real names." 	1
So they're sitting on Facebook, and they're sending these messages and arranging things and they don't know who anybody is, right? 	1
And so when he says to me, "Oh, I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars" or something, I'm like, "oh, well, I don't want you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends, and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars." 	1
And so you get this sort of logjam around identity where you want full disclosure from everybody else, but not from yourself. 	1
The teacher can't log into Facebook, because the school has blocked access to Facebook. 	1
So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones, and deleted their profiles. 	1
But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute, Stanford, American Neurological Association took this really far. 	1
But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition, either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly, and it may be evolution in real time. 	1
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology, but up here in the meat end of the scale. 	1
After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems, there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found. 	1
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate. 	1
From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment. 	1
Well, this is a little 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism. 	1
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. 	1
We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. 	1
So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life, I mean totally changed my life. 	1
And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure. 	1
So on the one hand, this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. 	1
What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick, but where you go to get healthy. 	1
And I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool. 	1
And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated, that we've already agreed upon. 	1
I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer, where it was like, oh my gosh, it's just your foot. 	1
So that's the kind of thing that, here, check this out, here's another way, and I won't overdo this. 	1
And these sub-movements are just kind of floating around, and as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent, and that's when the cognitive mind, you think, "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that." 	1
It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience. 	1
There's one other thing we can be doing -- well, there are a bunch of other things -- there's one other thing that I'm going to mention, and this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today. 	1
He said, "Professor, I don't mean any disrespect by this, but when your mama picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger than you are, and chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you, and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there," he looked at me and he said, "that's something you don't forget." 	1
That for me is successful legacy.  You know, as for me, my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. 	1
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. 	1
Interestingly, what he finds is — and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations: How many times does a future patent reference the older patent? — he finds something very interesting. 	1
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. 	1
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller." 	1
It's also used, Arduino's used, in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider. 	1
CA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you've unlocked? 	1
It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator. 	1
You know, some of the best submissions didn't come from geologists. 	1
Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh, in the moors of England, come in something called a murmuration, and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds, and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20-mile radius sort of doing their starling thing. 	1
Well, the murmuration functions to record a number of principles, and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. 	1
Could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness on a global basis? 	1
In the hands of the TED community, these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world, but in the hands of suicide bombers, the future can look quite different. 	1
How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us. 	1
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front, would we have better control? 	1
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be --   CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen? 	1
Bonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone. 	1
Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look. 	1
And what's amazing, when you use this technology, for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us. 	1
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little, and 100 people who did not take antibiotics. 	1
It shows very well that eyes can hear, and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound, such as the removal of time. 	1
You see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park, and it's led by key influencers, and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks, or wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up. 	1
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform, we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. 	1
So, here you see John on the track, he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that -- and you can see, actually, his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches. 	1
So, as we move forward into this technological future, I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment. 	1
In fact, as I looked into her case, I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car. 	1
You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer. 	1
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool, pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation. 	1
These, to me, are like living sculptures, right, that you can go and look at, and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life. 	1
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind. 	1
I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them. 	1
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about, but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk. 	1
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid, I mean, they'd be going crazy for it. 	1
I mean, if the people here who've had experience using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward. 	1
So you relate people that you wouldn't relate, and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces. 	1
Let's shift to a different kind of sea, the cyber sea. 	1
This is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public, to take on this kind of security. 	1
You can decide, what is your mental state: OK, I choose the caffeinated tea, I choose the chamomile tea. 	1
And, over time, we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about, because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. 	1
He was building a machine to do mathematics, and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics on this machine." And just as you do, everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now, because they've got a phone. 	1
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying, "We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs," —  — and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look, this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically." 	1
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one. 	1
What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top. 	1
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting. 	1
But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing, and that is the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face. 	1
And I thought, well, what is that relationship? 	1
Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter. 	1
And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look, but it's not a look a daughter gives her father. 	1
These paintings took a long time to make. 	1
The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting, and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it, I was standing there going, "Look at me. Please look at me." 	1
So honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture. 	1
It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea, and that's why I want you today to try to think about this, think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. 	1
We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics, and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees, and this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it. 	1
The four countries have no access to Facebook. 	1
At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter. 	1
You can almost joke everything about these princelings, everything! It's almost like you're living in the United States. 	1
Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats. 	1
 So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can, and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you, what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to, is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that 	1
So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did didn't really suck that bad. 	1
And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed to really check and see what we were doing, and basically give us our A plus report card, and so I showed him some shots we were working on, and waiting for the reaction that you hope for, which is what I got.   So I showed him these two shots, 	1
And so I'll just show it one more time. 	1
It takes a long, long time to make these scores, and right now I'm working on a piece that's 180 pages in length, and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair. 	1
You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way. 	1
I work often with designers and visual artists, obviously dancers and other choreographers, but also, more and more, with economists, anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, people really who come from very different domains of expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process. 	1
It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do with it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it very simply. I can describe it in my arms, right? 	1
They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah? 	1
So what I'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them: If, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go. 	1
But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom, and this is what it looks like in my classroom. 	1
And when you can do stuff like this -- These are my kids putting in this technology, and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this, this is the new green graffiti. 	1
And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids, you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool, and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible. 	1
We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring. 	1
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures. 	1
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer, it's kind of hard to miss. 	1
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem. 	1
then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain, he just thought it was his song. 	1
 Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours. 	1
And he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations -- that had seemed quite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. 	1
And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. 	1
He said, "You know what? One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative. 	1
It's an open-source programming language, and all of the interconnections between the people -- this is now not a software graph, but a people graph, all of the interconnections among the people working on that project — and this doesn't look like an org chart. 	1
So, when I was a child, I don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s, but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest.  It's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know, you're six, and you want to go and climb a tree. 	1
And there I was, lying there in this tiny space, hot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes, but it was really weird, like, after this went on for days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger and darker and cooler until I really looked forward to that half an hour of enforced immobility and rest, and I really looked forward to going to that place of darkness. 	1
In fact, Chris was worried and said, "Look, don't show them that slide, because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much. 	1
But as the decades passed, these festivals, they really became the establishment, and as the culture and capital accelerated, the Internet brought us all together, high and low kind of disappeared, a new kind of festival emerged. 	1
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made, and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did. 	1
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. 	1
I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about. 	1
Instead, people will have to look at data and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago, the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation, and as Kasparov realized, that means minimizing friction at the interface. 	1
"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?" 	1
The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is, when you're short of specialized health care professionals, use whoever is available in the community, train them to provide a range of health care interventions, and in these books I read inspiring examples, for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies, diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect. 	1
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [developed] world, are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs. 	1
We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society, and not limited simply to our institutions. 	1
The same can be said for our social systems, for our systems of government, where, at the very least, flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is, what's really broken, and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today, to redesign the flow of our institutions. 	1
Today we have the opportunity, and we have the imperative, to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions, thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury, the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance. 	1
This is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway, a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists, where you can go from one end of the city to the other without crossing the street, and they also have bike-sharing, which I'll get into in a minute. 	1
That's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways. 	1
So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here. 	1
And then take photographs, and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers looking at the car going by and shooting. 	1
This is looking down to the east, where the shooting vehicle sped off, and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers. 	1
No one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting, and in fact, as nice as these pictures are, and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court, and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you're trying to communicate numbers, abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values. 	1
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment, and we set up a field site at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms. 	1
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system, and finally we looked at the economics, and what I mean by economics is, what is the energy required to run the system? 	1
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you the artist's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay somewhere in the world, and we have in the background in this image, the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the CO2, but when you do the economics of this system, you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work. 	1
So that is terrific, and we thought, all right, as we're trying to solve this problem, clearly we have to think about genetics, we have to think about human testing, but there's a fundamental problem, because right now, stem cell lines, as extraordinary as they are, and lines are just groups of cells, they are made by hand, one at a time, and it takes a couple of months. 	1
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach, a different cognitive strategy, to make social decisions, and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab. 	1
You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen. 	1
He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches, and —  — he looks at them, and then in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them, and he starts to say, "You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look, if you do this -- " and he takes the laces out of their hand, 	1
And I looked up, and he's like, "Good to see you," and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything, and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said, "You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson, and you're going to need all the strength you can get." 	1
Sending and receiving letters took months -- if you were lucky. 	1
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?" 	1
You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it. 	1
This is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes. 	1
She was like, "You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying. 	1
This high school dropout died at the age of 82, a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and founder of Schocken Books, an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House. 	1
Text first, then images, we waited, CD-quality sound over the Net, then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible. 	1
It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out. 	1
You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect, make things happen? So for instance, you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there, and know that you know someone in Eco, over here, and these people here are in Eco, the people you might engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy. 	1
I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important discovery, and we know a good bit about that now, and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease, and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse, and that makes sense. 	1
So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe? 	1
Control passes to blue, and blue says, "I accept it," in which case he'd get the money, or blue says, "I reject it," in which case no one gets anything. Okay? 	1
It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines at a time, but let's just focus on two. 	1
We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously. 	1
And as I look at the conversation, it strikes me that it's focused on exactly the right topic, and at the same time, it's missing the point entirely. 	1
There has been one story, one development in human history that bent the curve, bent it just about 90 degrees, and it is a technology story. 	1
And this is kind of how we used to do innovation. 	1
We'd find a bunch of fairly similar-looking people ... 	1
We need to publish all trials in humans, including the older trials, for all drugs in current use, and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed. 	1
And after two more years of studying music, I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic. 	1
When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight, you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay? 	1
You probably — No, you didn't. Okay.  My simple idea is that what's happened is, the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us, so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize, but which no longer exists. 	1
If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity," you get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million.  Are you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception. 	1
There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more, the whole of that green line disappears, and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle. 	1
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy, and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings. 	1
Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why?  Because — Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world, over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable. 	1
You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world. 	1
If you come and watch this a week from now, this will be completely different, dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web, everything is sourced, so click your link, and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. 	1
If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn, you'd realize your streets and the distances -- they'd be way off. 	1
Beyond these technical solutions, our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change. 	1
You. Yeah.  With the weird teeth. And you next to him.  You know who you are. 	1
Actually, that whole row isn't right.  That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me.  I am one of the one in four. Thank you. 	1
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane, so, you see what the problem is? What once made you safe now drives you insane. 	1
And as long as we've looked for explanations, we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science, which is hypotheses as to why we get sick, and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well. 	1
And so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that Facebook would never make a change to something with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial. 	1
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism, but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century. 	1
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand, say, Coca-Cola. 	1
One is reducing their market. What I mean is, it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete. 	1
It's not just the marketeers of terrorism, which is those who finance, those who facilitate it, but it's the consumers of terrorism. 	1
They are looking at what I've started off on, on these more asymmetrical approaches to it, more modernist views, cause and effect. 	1
It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want. 	1
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this? 	1
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees, and it was published. Okay?   It took four months to do the science, two years to get it published.  Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world. 	1
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project. 	1
XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well, those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo. 	1
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate. 	1
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book. 	1
And if we're thinking about a finance system, we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible for one person to take in the amount, the volume of information, and analyze it to make good decisions. 	1
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request, to ask your public body a question, so it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests, so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question, for example, how many police officers have a criminal record? 	1
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors. 	1
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road, feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts, feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. 	1
In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt, is to become again vigorous and vibrant, it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians, but for the politicians to learn to trust the public. 	1
In particular, when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices, just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong. 	1
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun, as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade, each of the tiles moves individually. 	1
So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials. 	1
You know, developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank. 	1
But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible. 	1
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond. 	1
and with no support, felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital; or the new parents, the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability, and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential, are told by the doctors, 	1
The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support, empowering communities to look after their own children. 	1
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist. 	1
Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got. 	1
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice. Now, some people will say, well, magic, that must be the work of some evil supernatural force.    Whoa. 	1
Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time, so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope, keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like, and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see, 	1
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that, and you'd never find that on Earth. 	1
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem. 	1
And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases, or does this variation just make you different? 	1
And so therefore, if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is, i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function, for its survival, it will be the same in all of those different lineages, species, taxa. 	1
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this? 	1
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem, they allow us to understand how our genome functions, and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth. 	1
And from that moment I realized that Movember is so much more than a mustache, having a joke. 	1
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready. 	1
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out. 	1
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid. 	1
And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race.  We have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism, a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves; a New York Times exposé on fake book reviews. 	1
What about résumés? We did a study in which we had people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn, which is a social networking site like Facebook, but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé. 	1
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities. 	1
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception, really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not. 	1
If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to? 	1
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something. 	1
My outbox for email is massive, and I never look at it. I write all the time, but I never look at my record, at my trace. 	1
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze, but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke, and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen, like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute. 	1
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas," and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror, and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture. 	1
But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that, you have to take a picture. 	1
We're three brothers from New Jersey, and the funny thing is that, believe it or not, we are hooked on bluegrass and we're excited to play it for you tonight. 	1
They picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord. 	1
They took out two of my broken ribs, and they rebuilt my back, L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib, they fused T12, L1 and L2 together. 	1
And I realized that this wasn't just my life. 	1
It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain. 	1
They said, "You know, when do you want to come out?" 	1
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.  It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV. 	1
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. 	1
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly. 	1
And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball? 	1
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun. 	1
So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system, and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball. 	1
So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around, and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it.  So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around, and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance, and we know that these species here actually 	1
"Abdul, are you okay?" "I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right." 	1
The next time you're on an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue. 	1
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook. 	1
As a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was looking from the outside, from Dublin, Twitter lists, and lists of good sources, people we could establish were credible, were really important. 	1
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer, and sure enough, there's the white lilo, there are the two trees, there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo. 	1
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter. 	1
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing, you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor, rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where the real meat of life is to be found, the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days. 	1
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers, trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom, and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history. 	1
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time, and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves. 	1
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning, and that's that the insula does a lot. 	1
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it, don't just take them at their word. 	1
And we were just at the beginning of the story. 	1
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands, and have a coffee and a nice discussion, and we talk about food and basketball. 	1
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like. 	1
We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis, and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis. 	1
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government, a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying and cheating and hurting each other, maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department and an army, but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery. 	1
When you look at how the federal government spends money, so this is the battle right here, 55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs, 20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary, and six percent interest. 	1
And so what this tells me is, when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems, we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue. 	1
Second doctor: And good, just take it nice and slow, Jake. 	1
And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito that's carrying that virus. Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms. 	1
That actually wouldn't be such a problem, because if we were really all going to die, we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took, and we'd find a way to deflect them. 	1
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis, so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is, you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues. 	1
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale. 	1
But when you look at cross-party ratings, you find, well, that it's lower, but actually, when I first saw this data, I was surprised. 	1
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this, where there's just so much stuff coming in, it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody, we've got to just work together, just start shooting." 	1
And I took the headmaster to task and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down that this wasn't about me, but all these years later it was totally me. 	1
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results, they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections. 	1
Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place. 	1
And this is ongoing work, but dermatologists -- I mean, I'm a dermatologist. 	1
I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight. 	1
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything? 	1
"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes." 	1
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents.  Sometimes they look like our spouses, but they are not your parents or spouses. 	1
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story. 	1
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. 	1
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. 	1
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this, it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. 	1
And it doesn't just stay on the screen. 	1
This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months, and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions. 	1
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now -- most people in this room, I bet -- and it's something that's -- I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived, and this is my way of doing that, if you could just type in on a website, "June 18, 2018," and you would just see a stream of people's lives on that particular day from all over the world. 	1
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act. 	1
And if you do not let us continue with our work, I will hold a press conference here, right now, right in this road, and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era." 	1
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered. 	1
"I'm convinced," I told a German official with the World Bank, if they worked in Germany, in a German administration, just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes, they would be bribed just the same." 	1
And then we can debate, you know, is it better to be there, where performance is strong at the price of large disparities? 	1
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries. 	1
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture. 	1
They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices. 	1
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. 	1
So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system. So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. 	1
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird, you just focus on the rules of interaction. 	1
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back. 	1
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is. 	1
And so, when I see my partner on his own or her own, doing something in which they are enveloped, I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception, and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me. 	1
And then the third group of answers usually would be: when I'm surprised, when we laugh together, as somebody said to me in the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots. 	1
And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message And if we can actually provide feedback, sensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator back to the brain, how the brain deals with that, of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery. 	1
But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse. 	1
And this is what one of these experiments looks like. 	1
Instead of turning to friends or relatives, they looked to David's workplace. 	1
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax. 	1
Do you know where your parents went to high school? 	1
And you can look far back into the past, but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is, it's quite easy to figure out where it came from. 	1
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident. 	1
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers. 	1
Well, I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments. 	1
There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say, "What are those twinkling lights?" 	1
And I've got to -- hang on, I've got to get this wording exactly right, because, you know, it's very important. 	1
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?" 	1
And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years, or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company, we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers, said they would offer unprecedented concessions, sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. 	1
Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig. 	1
And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, "Your music has helped my daughter so much. 	1
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them, you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae, leading to increased runoff and evaporation. 	1
Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry, what could we do to keep that healthy? 	1
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. 	1
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. 	1
 Narrator:  Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa! 	1
I'm not the only kid who grew up this way, surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones, as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called, and we got called them all. 	1
who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector, marching every year directly into the for-profit sector because they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice. 	1
So the next time you're looking at a charity, don't ask about the rate of their overhead. 	1
But that can't be the answer, because these drugs actually don't work all that well. 	1
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well. 	1
 It's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out, "How do I find out if they have emotions or not?" 	1
And what this quantification showed us is that, upon experiencing a train of these air puffs, the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent, long-lasting, and also appears to be graded. 	1
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation. 	1
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies, they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. 	1
But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades. 	1
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway. 	1
They're basically viable cells, so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the Javan banteng, put it in a cow, the cow went to term, and what was born was a live, healthy baby Javan banteng, who thrived and is still alive. 	1
Three thousand years ago, civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile, some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance, smelling of sheep shit, I guess, proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne, "We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you." 	1
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. 	1
We didn't all know each other, but we all kind of trusted each other, and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network, and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things. 	1
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. 	1
Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake, and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work, but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to, and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes. 	1
And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile. 	1
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time. 	1
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption, so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. 	1
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas. 	1
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet. 	1
Turned out, it didn't work very well for cancer, but it has exactly the right properties, the right shape, to work for progeria, and that's what's happened. 	1
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building. 	1
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of." 	1
It's something that I've worked on and a few other people, and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute. 	1
And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there. 	1
Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well. 	1
So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer. 	1
So in this case, if you look carefully, most of the arrows flow from right to left. 	1
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do? 	1
And if they said yes, we gave them the one that they built and we broke. 	1
In the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet, found all the pairs of letters, gave it to the experimenter, the experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom, say "Uh huh," and put it on the pile next to them. 	1
So how do we look at this question experimentally? 	1
Now when we looked at the easy origami, we saw the same thing -- builders loved it more, evaluators loved it less. 	1
If we look at construction and manufacturing, there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption and excessive labor techniques. 	1
You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know. 	1
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings, unpack the meaning of the clue. 	1
These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book. 	1
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. 	1
That young man went on to graduate from UMBC, to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. 	1
As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself, it's another thing to help someone else do well. 	1
And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center, you'll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses, having an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology, using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus, and not giving students the theories, but having them struggle with those theories. 	1
So what does this personal health system look like, and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail? 	1
So we're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby's doing. 	1
TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here, give me a lay of the land. 	1
The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours, and make this kind of tool available, not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world, but in the mainstream -- every patient, every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. 	1
We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know what the tools will be, nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different. 	1
I didn't have an exact address, but I knew his name, Abed, I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara, and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city, he broke my neck. 	1
I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones, and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic. 	1
You know, it was most often when speaking to people that I wondered where I ended and my disability began, for many people told me what they told no one else. 	1
It was this youth who on May 16, 1990, had broken two necks including mine, and bruised one brain and taken one life. 	1
It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level. 	1
Not much has changed, by the way.  But they thought that, if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease, it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit. 	1
And this is accomplished using this kind of device, and this is called deep brain stimulation. 	1
And in order to understand it, what we want to see is the way, in this new kind of language, there is new structure coming up. 	1
Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to, along the lines of, "We're going to have That's kind of like what we're at. 	1
Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income. 	1
And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900, only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years. 	1
If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress, because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. 	1
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling, but like too many others, they misunderstand its basic causes. 	1
You see, I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture, and as a result, we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. 	1
I know some of you in the crowd are thinking, well, carbon dioxide is horrible, it's a greenhouse gas. 	1
We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars, just sharing GPS. 	1
It seemed kind of odd to do, and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking, "I have to be the one to ask the next question," because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation. 	1
And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. 	1
to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. 	1
So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. 	1
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point, but before that I was obsessed with space, and I was really excited about, you know, being an astronaut and designing rockets, which was something that was always exciting to me. 	1
And I think, I think, that looking at the technology, this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas, and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years, which is an advantage for the developing world. 	1
And I want you to just see what I've become." 	1
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds, and we didn't know how to deal with these. 	1
And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us. 	1
Once you get that electronic tattoo, you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time, so as you go through this stuff, just be careful what you post. 	1
But I am angry.  And the last time I looked, I'm --  So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry. 	1
And you know something about a lousy school? 	1
For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School. 	1
I mean, I really believe they should be closed. 	1
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John, 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. 	1
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school, and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. 	1
They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood, a school that they can be proud to say they attend, and a school that the community can be proud of as well, and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances. 	1
You see, in the end, education is about learning. 	1
I mean, there's a bit, but it's not what gets people up in the morning, what keeps them at their desks. 	1
You see, there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education -- That's what happens in some systems. 	1
First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. 	1
At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. 	1
I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management, and just all of those different facets of the classroom. 	1
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. 	1
Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars, whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music, we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met. 	1
And --   And it worked really well there. 	1
So —  — I took this to those same teens, because those teens are really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try. 	1
So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit, and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you. 	1
And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up.  And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target? 	1
We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by Marsha, who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can't get out there, and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands. 	1
Man 4: You ready? You ready?  Woman 2: Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture. 	1
Though in all seriousness, this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass. 	1
This project has lasted now, been just over two years. 	1
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment. 	1
But before you give yourself too much credit, look at this. 	1
You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization, the Against Malaria Foundation, which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one, and we know reliably that if we provide nets, they're used, and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria, just one of the many preventable diseases 	1
So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving. 	1
Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents. 	1
Now, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job, but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful. 	1
So what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model. 	1
How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on, but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning, off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation -- low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions that anyone can very, very easily make, and to put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone? 	1
The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. 	1
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few. 	1
  You know, we have to go through that. 	1
You know, video games can be truly deep even when they're completely mindless. 	1
I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college. 	1
You see a hand counting money just in front of me. 	1
There were issues of bad food being served as I recall that some of the food I ate is just not good for a human being. 	1
AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort. 	1
So yes, when the backup systems are put in place, I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes, but it's a hazard of a profession. 	1
 And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting. 	1
They synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger. 	1
The reason it's different is that, just in the past few years, our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never, ever had before: understanding, speaking, hearing, seeing, answering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills. 	1
For example, mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive, but the research arm of the Defense Department just launched a competition to have them do things like this, and if the track record is any guide, this competition is going to be successful. 	1
He was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film, and to write, direct, and produce the film myself. 	1
Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks, it was a revelation, a discovery, that we had the potential, together, to be masters of our own fate, to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine, and then to design a better life. 	1
This is a measure of global overvaluation of all markets, expressing what I call an illusion of a perpetual money machine that suddenly broke in 2007. 	1
And all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes. 	1
Well, nine percent of what we spend is damage, misuse or abuse of any sort. 	1
Well, first thing we do, we get showers working. 	1
The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day -- clean, smokeless and free for the family. 	1
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets. 	1
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread, even though it usually didn't. 	1
So in America, it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school. 	1
I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am, just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah. 	1
They said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous, someone would have told us." 	1
And some people are blind because they think, well, seeing anything is just futile. 	1
And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say, "Well, you know, the people who do see, they're whistleblowers, and we all know what happens to them." 	1
She came up to me one night, and she just said, 'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'" Or I think of Cynthia Thomas, a really loyal army daughter and army wife, who, as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War, was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post-traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town 	1
"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit. 	1
In The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience, and when you actually look at that, and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at, and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting. 	1
Paul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel." 	1
Office worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No. 	1
It's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look, a theory about motivation and the mood we're in and how the mood we're in determines the things we like or dislike. 	1
OK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project. 	1
Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope. 	1
Now, I don't want to create the misimpression that China's hunky-dory, on the way to some kind of superpowerdom. 	1
So I know the largest public opinion survey company in China, okay? 	1
So there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people. 	1
And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here. 	1
We have paper forms to track drug supplies, blood supplies -- all these different paper forms for many different topics, they all have a single, common endpoint, and the common endpoint looks something like this. 	1
This looks like a series of breaking waves, and it's caused by shearing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly, and in the middle, in between, you get this undulating of the air, and if the difference in those speeds is just right, the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices. 	1
So it started when Jonny was little, and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping. 	1
Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. 	1
And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge. 	1
Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years. 	1
You see, shell companies, they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. 	1
These are big brains, highly social animals, and I thought, well, if we give them choice and control, if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard -- and by the way, it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett-Packard with an Apple II computer. 	1
This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle-aged white men, mostly middle-aged white men. 	1
 However, subjecting myself to that interrogation -- I answered all their questions, and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right -- and I finally landed the lab space I needed. 	1
So that ranges from heart disease, to malaria, HIV, AIDS, as well as other forms of cancer -- anything. 	1
They were just there, but they had no significance. 	1
The number of people living in countries not their own now comes to 220 million, and that's an almost unimaginable number, but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada and the whole population of Australia and then the whole population of Australia again and the whole population of Canada again and doubled that number, you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe. 	1
There's three particular things that I've done, and I'll just describe those first, and then talk about some of my work. 	1
And that's kind of been a big lesson to me, that you can't act on any object. 	1
So what we do is we take conventional printing presses, we make conductive inks, and run those through a press, and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive. 	1
Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions. 	1
No. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to. 	1
And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules, so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious, depending on the behavior of the molecules. 	1
Now that argument, I made that argument 30 -- oh my God, I don't want to think about it — more than 30 years ago, but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you, and I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is, consciousness creates an observer-independent reality. 	1
So that's a sort of Starbucks currency And what I find interesting is that Amazon has recently launched Amazon coins. 	1
I mean, at the end, will he be able to work? 	1
And you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself, but it was a failure that will impact his full life. 	1
I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum. 	1
She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare. 	1
He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books, two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and five Gobots. And this was his treasure. 	1
Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett, and she rolls through the grass, and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude. 	1
So sustainability is quite important for us, which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values. 	1
So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives, and they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in, they just stop everything and go and run and save a life. 	1
We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive. 	1
I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high, and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft. 	1
Well, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students." 	1
The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it, and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly, and as such, it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care. 	1
And as I sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree, in the dark, there was no electricity, just the full moon, down in this empty square, and I heard the most beautiful sounds, like a Charles Ives concert as I listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once-every-five-years ceremony. 	1
So in the theater, as much as the story is critical and the book and the language, the telling of the story, how it's told, the mechanics, the methods that you use, is equal to the story itself. 	1
PP: ♪ Rise above yourself and take control. ♪ George Tsypin: We're looking at New York from a Spider-Man point of view. 	1
It's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive. 	1
And we climbed up and we got to the very top, and we're on the edge, on this precipice, Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end, and I'm up there alone on this incredible precipice. 	1
And so we installed a real-time link between the ambulance and the hospital, just using normal 3G telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care. 	1
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. 	1
So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see. 	1
You know, presenting a sound, well-argued, tight argument in English before a francophone audience just isn't going to work. 	1
And I have a question: "Well, what do you mean? 	1
And so at the end of the day, I say, "You know what? I guess you're right: P." 	1
The argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. 	1
The creative spirit in Africa, the creative tradition, is as potent as it has always been, if only designers could look within. This Ethiopic cross illustrates what Dr. Ron Eglash has established: that Africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals. 	1
They've been looking outward for a long time, yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp, right within them. 	1
And so whenever you heard any note at all -- if I just play a random note --  -- you knew instantly what it was, and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano. 	1
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one. 	1
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all, because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know, you're invited to come and sing it first, and then he'll pick it up."  So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish. 	1
So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes, just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain. 	1
The first is sort of the restoration idea, and it's somewhat intuitive. 	1
And this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense. 	1
 Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam, you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend. 	1
But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime, he wasn't the only guy searching. 	1
It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no. 	1
Maybe we can take a look at some of those. 	1
["OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation... neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome"] SR: So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work. 	1
Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before, but at the same time, if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory, this will change the memory. 	1
SR: And for me personally, I see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we'd like. 	1
Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes, chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it, and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene and make it look like a two-dimensional painting. 	1
Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk, it would wash all the paint off of her arms, and it might seem a little bit clumsy, but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms. 	1
And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself bumping up against. 	1
One of the many post-rational excuses made by the Japanese government for killing whales is that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise and then there'll be more for people to eat." 	1
 But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --   Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. 	1
There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc., but they can't be transported to the 60 countries in our world where English is the first and the second language. 	1
For me, that would be the perfect superpower, actually kind of an evil way of approaching it. 	1
And even stranger, there were these people, these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family, and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself. 	1
So we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this, and the similar talks kind of smash together, and the different ones fly apart, and what we're left with is something quite beautiful. 	1
Remember, it's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics, and let's say we could take two of them, like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines. 	1
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system, and yet he got an idea. 	1
Would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event? 	1
We get misinformation not only if we're questioned in a leading way, but if we talk to other witnesses who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information, or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced, all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory. 	1
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind, we'd do well to, that memory, like liberty, is a fragile thing. 	1
So there's the scientific method, but what's really going on is this.  [The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around] And it's going on kind of like that. 	1
So what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course, and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot. 	1
So instead of how much you know about it, we could say, "What can you ask about it?" 	1
And the fellow said, "Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there." 	1
Now you see again, this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience, and it was important to that person what color bears were -- that is, they had to hunt bears. 	1
Compare the banker in 1900, who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage. 	1
And when we said to our parents and grandparents, "How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?" 	1
And I wouldn't be lying, but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either, because the truth is, that's just the life everyone else sees. 	1
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say, "I'm going through hell," and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay, and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people. 	1
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies, proximity to death, or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death, I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. 	1
But I know that my husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives, when they can ritually recount his life's narrative, weaving his story into the history of their community. 	1
So I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out. 	1
So in my case, I thought, well, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming? 	1
He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well, and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table, also lots and lots of bottles of wine. 	1
 So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system, because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me. 	1
It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online. 	1
What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side, so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week. 	1
You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually, yes, be responsible, but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. 	1
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know? 	1
It began with this tweet: "On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel." 	1
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text. 	1
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. 	1
Today, generations are looking at China and saying, "China can produce infrastructure, China can produce economic growth, and we like that." 	1
You know, we say, half the world is living in cities. 	1
And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today. 	1
So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable, but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. 	1
Do you know where it's three per 100,000? 	1
And actually, the structure of those tissues is quite different, and it's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease, other conditions, in terms of how and you're going to need to think about the materials you're going to use really carefully, their biochemistry, their mechanics, and many other properties as well. 	1
And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest, which is just here, and then transplant that somewhere else in the body. 	1
And I'm just going to tell you, sometimes those contacts are very strange, slightly unexpected, and the very most interesting, let me put it that way, contact that I had, was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head. 	1
And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system, but either way, we don't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes. 	1
Just over three years ago, I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela, and while flying over the city, I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city, a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums, draped literally all over the mountains. 	1
These dwellings are called the yaodongs. 	1
Today, you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. 	1
So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband. 	1
He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids. 	1
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead." 	1
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing." 	1
In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept. 	1
What will this future without secrets look like? 	1
Again, marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. 	1
And at the risk of playing the serpent, I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here, the awareness of what is going on, and in your hands, just a few clicks away. 	1
I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great, only it kind of sounds like a woman." 	1
It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. 	1
But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box. 	1
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him." 	1
If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward? 	1
Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet? 	1
I mean, one can take a position on that. 	1
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. 	1
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it. 	1
It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. 	1
Well, the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. 	1
It turned out that more than 100 years of research on spinal cord physiology, starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington, had shown that the spinal cord, below most injuries, contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion, but because input from the brain is interrupted, they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant. 	1
My idea: Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk. 	1
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. 	1
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. 	1
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this. 	1
Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. 	1
I just figured I'd made a mistake, and went back to the right, and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. 	1
Similarly, just through the grip of the cane, you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below, and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. 	1
And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities, and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. 	1
If you're blind, you don't drive.  They don't like it when you drive.  If you design a city with the blind in mind, you design a city with a robust, accessible, well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. 	1
How many of you have been to Oklahoma City? 	1
So I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there. 	1
Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back. 	1
Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people. 	1
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check. 	1
Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. 	1
This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. 	1
This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. 	1
I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. 	1
Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me. 	1
They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. 	1
I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them. 	1
Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight. 	1
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. 	1
In biology, we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general, so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us? 	1
So because of cooking, what once was a major liability, this large, dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons, could now become a major asset, now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. 	1
Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model, not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again, but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims? 	1
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. 	1
And again, in Peterborough, we started off with a program, but we also collected data, and over the period of time, we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements, so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term: greater engagement from the prisoners, longer-term engagement as well. 	1
Now I want to share this picture with you, not just because it's so beautiful, but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. 	1
I myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache, just couldn't shake it, thought, "Well, I'll try something different." 	1
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. 	1
And just as busways are, protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy, because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle to one in a $30,000 car. 	1
You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. 	1
And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe, not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. 	1
And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. 	1
Now by 2010, as well, popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit, and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city." 	1
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale, because I know that sounds like a big number, but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. 	1
So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013, we released Detroit Future City, which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence -- not what it was, but what it could be, looking at new ways of economic growth, new forms of land use, more sustainable and denser neighborhoods, a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system, and a heightened capacity for civic leaders 	1
But think about it: Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad, so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. 	1
So here we go, and I somehow, without a decision, went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe, I just went into thinking about this dream, and why, and how. 	1
 But the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation, it wasn't like that. 	1
Paul Piff: Okay, so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. 	1
In fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse, and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same, at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years. 	1
For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people. 	1
In one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them, and after watching that, we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. 	1
After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor, suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical, but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values, and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy. 	1
Let's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study. 	1
In the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective, and what you do there is you give it to people with cancer and you see if it actually makes them better. 	1
If you have a very good model of a language which is used, if you have a very good model of a document, how well they are structured. 	1
And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well. 	1
As one example, in the brown layer there's a certain type of cell called a Langerhans cell -- every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells, those immune cells, and there's others shown as well that we haven't stained in this image. 	1
So he could call evenly on men and women. And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better, and he was able to go back to them and tell them that. 	1
It's just that we judge them through a different lens, and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead, are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss, and in a woman, she's bossy. 	1
The foundation I started along with the book "Lean In" helps women, or men, start circles -- small groups, it can be 10, it can be however many you want, which meet once a month. 	1
Two years ago, I knew exactly what an icon looked like. 	1
 And I realize that this object was in my mind, born from the same mind, from the same womb, practically, as Barbie Ballerina.  And then there's the elephants.  Those extraordinary elephants with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with these golden tusks and so on. 	1
 So, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror. 	1
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war, having just finished the washing up.  He seems also to have forgotten his sword. 	1
One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions, it doesn't matter so much how something looks; it's all in the motion, in the timing of how the thing moves. 	1
And I thought, humans and robots don't look at all like this. 	1
For one half of the people, I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional, calculated robotic brain. 	1
And in a way, I thought, maybe it's time -- just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century, from going from the very calculated, planned way of behaving, to a more intuitive, risk-taking, embodied way of behaving -- maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution. 	1
And I thought, what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you, but would actually enjoy it, too? 	1
And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. 	1
I told my TAs, okay, 24/7, we're going to be up monitoring the forum, answering questions. 	1
Now this is all not just in the future. 	1
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. 	1
So let your haters hate, you know what, and make your change, because I know you can. 	1
I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change, and I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in, and you can trade it across all these social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, 	1
But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. 	1
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah! 	1
I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. 	1
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites, but fortunately we had help. 	1
So about three or four weeks later, we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed, and they told us that back in the 1970s, the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff -- that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution, being able to see objects one meter in size, they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images, 	1
Now people use these because they get a lot of light, which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image. 	1
What do I mean by the informal in this case? 	1
And after a while, if the viewer continues to remain in the space, the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again, until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement, when they will again snap to attention. 	1
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them. 	1
And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who I work with, a senior designer. 	1
I said, "How come you're not doing sustainability? I know you know this." 	1
I mean, let me clarify something right here. 	1
 I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue. 	1
Well, this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in. 	1
What would that look like that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system? 	1
We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant, as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books. 	1
If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage, you expect a party to happen at any moment, and you need to be ready. 	1
Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me, just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that way now, and I agree with that. 	1
But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like, I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. 	1
As most of you guys know, cities are being asked every day to do more with less, and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. 	1
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. 	1
So I was very excited by this, you know, hopping around all over the place, trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. 	1
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. 	1
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. 	1
As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get, investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money. 	1
I think there is no doubt that the sector not just a trimming at the margins. 	1
The video they've produced is very sexy, and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. 	1
 Narrator: You want to look through your target's eyes. 	1
Now, when I first looked into this, I'd never heard of this unit before. 	1
It turns out that "you don't care" is just as much a part of who we are as "that's not fair." 	1
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom, however, is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle, and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. 	1
But of course, that doesn't exactly happen, and that's because we can't just take form into account. 	1
I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male, or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough, then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things: avoiding predators, taking care of offspring, gathering and ingesting food. 	1
I remember my cousin Sasha, two years old at the time, looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand, licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand. 	1
Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala. 	1
But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm, they look beautiful. 	1
And she was offered contracts as a model, at which point she teased me, when she said, "You know, I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one." 	1
This is what Nicole would look like if we weren't doing what we were doing. 	1
Look, you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence. 	1
Books on empathy have become bestsellers, like "The Empathic Civilization" RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't? 	1
SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole. 	1
But maybe even more importantly, allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means, to be able to look down and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would -- the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic, constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. 	1
So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually, the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes "goosh" into your other eye, and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. 	1
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders and there's one -- one -- that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting. 	1
Instead you kind of look around and go, "Okay, I can't see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me. 	1
They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity, kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example. 	1
I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. 	1
CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage, I think, actually, to come and speak openly to this group. 	1
A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other. 	1
 We have a lot to get through. I only have 13 minutes.  Now, some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world, that they are outliers, and that point of view is understandable, because by their nature, parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. 	1
I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor. 	1
Five miracles, mostly delivered, and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. 	1
In conclusion, I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us, just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge, multidisciplinary skills, and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. 	1
We need to help them to find their own role models, and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible, and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus, and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums, we need to encourage them to find their own path, even if it's very different from our own. 	1
You could go online, you could look at pages, and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech-savvy for the time. 	1
And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things, like, she's buying a crib or baby clothes, but things like, she bought more vitamins than she normally had, or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers. 	1
It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale. 	1
We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. 	1
Looking deeply inside nature, through the magnifying glass of science, designers extract principles, processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology. 	1
 So when I was feeling bad about myself, insecure, I would jack my height up.  But when I was feeling confident and suave, I would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance. 	1
Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it? Number two. 	1
I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk, "Laws that choke creativity." 	1
And I said to him, "You know, Aaron, it's not my field, not my field." 	1
Well, we started with this march with 200 people, and next year, there will be 1,000 on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause, and then in 2016, before the primary, there will be 10,000 who march across that state, meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. 	1
Now, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me. 	1
Over here, it's a little hotter, and over there, it's a little cooler, and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room, because where it was a little hotter, there was a little more stuff, and where there was a little more stuff, we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. 	1
We're never going to see the stuff outside, but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky, we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. 	1
And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society, but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about, well, what might we do and how might we go about it? 	1
Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports, and this is what the team came to me with, which is, to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than 200 days a year explains why women were saying to me, "I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it, and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there." 	1
CA: Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big, sad face to get engaged. 	1
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't -- this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey, and we don't travel together as much for the foundation, actually, as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. 	1
I mean, Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in 2006, and it was really his decision, but again, it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. 	1
Well, turns out it took an injection every day for 10 days. 	1
They had six children, and as I talked to Anna in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day, and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children. 	1
The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about, okay, do you hire staff, what do you give to them? 	1
In this photo, everything looks very finished, but that granite edge, those lights, the back on that bench, the trees in planting, and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be. 	1
Well now, all over New York City, there are places where you can find your very own seat. 	1
 The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side, and when the train stopped running, it became a self-seeded landscape, a kind of a garden in the sky. 	1
Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see forever changes our understanding of the world, and by looking at unseen worlds, we recognize that we exist in the living universe, and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards. Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives. 	1
The reason, I would come to find out, was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. 	1
In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab, one of our patients, a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about 20 years and worn dozens of legs, said of one of our printed parts, "It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows, and it's effing sexy." 	1
 MK: That to say, when you look at the picture behind us, to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do. 	1
MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning. GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. 	1
So that's a scooter, but she had -- well, she still has a BMW motorcycle. 	1
There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids, and the answer often is, not so great. 	1
About three years ago, a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. 	1
The curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness that the Bézier formula imposes. 	1
So do you look at these and say, "Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem, and by God it shows in the results." 	1
So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions. 	1
It took two years, but I learned a lot. 	1
And look, as economical in data as a sans serif. 	1
You know, at times of technical innovation, designers want to be influenced by what's in the air. 	1
Microsoft were absolutely right, it took a good 10 years, but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution, and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti-aliasing and so on. 	1
The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance, it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm's length. 	1
and he said, "You learn how little you know." 	1
Now that exact same shark had engaged, or encountered this SAMS rig, which is the Elude SAMS rig, about eight minutes before, and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it, looking for what it could smell and sense but not see, and this was the final engagement. 	1
Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers, and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig, so a black neoprene wetsuit, and going straight to the bottom, coming up and engaging. 	1
You see, this will be an entirely new global data set. 	1
So if we want to tweak the color, we just enter the color mode, and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color, or if we want to adjust the audio, then we get two different dials for that, these physical objects. 	1
All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism, but yet we have a long way to go. 	1
There's some dispersal, but it's kind of grouped around that average body type. 	1
But the more we learn about how that limiter functions, the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit, in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. 	1
I was so nervous and I was thinking just, like, oh my God, oh my God, and reminding me, because I've had, like, some very, especially since the last time we were here at TED, it was, like, unbelievable, and then right after that, like, so many crazy things happened, like, we ended up going to the White House to perform. 	1
I don't know why. You know what I'm saying. 	1
But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism, and I do hope that we can continue to kind of 3D print, well, let us just say I like to think that even in the future we will have the publication, kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print. 	1
And, you know, she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether. 	1
If we can learn to deal with our discomfort, and just relax into it, we'll have a better life. 	1
I'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally. 	1
I just wonder, do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty? 	1
 Now, after 70 nanoseconds, the ball will reach home plate, or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball, and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop, which also starts to disintegrate. 	1
It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get. 	1
And in fact, you can just look at pizza delivery drivers. 	1
But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary, mortal intelligence that didn't finish university, and they'd kind of forgive you, and pet you like the dog. 	1
But the thing is, they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music. 	1
So when one ant meets another, it doesn't matter which ant it meets, and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message. 	1
And cost us over 10 million jobs as well. 	1
  George Costanza: Oh boy, I was up til four in the morning watching that Omen trilogy. 	1
I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards, not just from L.D., from my life, but for decades. 	1
We can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair. 	1
Well, the first thing, of course, is that we're mammals, and mammals are smelly. 	1
As you know, there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet. 	1
How many more? Right about now, we can feed about 450 million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch, which, of course, you know is going down, so that number will go down over time if we don't fix it, but if we put fishery management practices like the ones I've described in place in 10 to 25 countries, we could bring that number up 	1
What was the context? Well, America was urbanizing. 	1
Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company was up and running, brokering deals for these things nationwide, and the Los Angeles Times announced, very confidently, "The teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear, and for four years, possibly eight, the children of the United States will play with billy possum." 	1
Well, "Thank you for your service" means to me, it means acknowledging our stories, asking us who we are, understanding the strength that so many people, so many people who we serve with, have, and why that service means so much. 	1

Well, they say if you dream something hard enough, it will come to pass. 	1
I dreamt I would leave this town, and just like those ships, once they were launched, I'd never come back. 	1

You couldn't give an account of the natural world that didn't say something about its relationship, for example, to the creation story in the Abrahamic tradition, the creation story in the first book of the Torah. 	1
By the end of the 19th century, you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is. 	1
Religion has not being separated from any other areas of life, and in particular, what's crucial to understand about this world is that it's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what Rattray is going to call religion, because if they want an explanation of something, if they want to know why the crop just failed, if they want to know why it's raining 	1
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis, because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people, say, 18 years old, to the reports of people who were 28, and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan. 	1
Again, we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years, and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years, and what we found, well, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over, because once again the rate of change does slow as we age, but at every age, people underestimate in the next decade. 	1
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences? 	1
It's a poem about loneliness -- the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last — and it might look like a plea for help 'til you get to the word "help," where this "I" facing you, taking your hand, is more like a teacher or a genie, or at least that's what he wants to believe. 	1
Now, how do I know that I'm right Well in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it." 	1
If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out, it's about the size of a table napkin, and it's still a thin structure. 	1
So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott, a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy. It's known as Stonewall, in 1969, and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting. Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion, and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism, 	1
After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country, and the modern gay rights movement as we know it took off. 	1
They even included this nice little write-up of my book. 	1
And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down. 	1
Improvisation theater, just like science, goes into the unknown, because you have to make a scene onstage without a director, without a script, without having any idea what you'll portray or what the other characters will do. 	1
Part of me was like, okay, when's he going to ask me to wire 10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right? 	1
One set of people look frightened.  They often say something like, "Oh, I'd better be careful what I say. 	1
Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands: How many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using? 	1
Just think about the phrase "Look it up in the dictionary," which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same. 	1
But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries? 	1
We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about "impact" as a verb and "invite" as a noun. 	1
If alternatives are equally good, you should just flip a coin between them, and it seems a mistake to think, here's how you should decide between careers, places to live, people to marry: Flip a coin. 	1
Instead of looking for reasons out there, we should be looking for reasons in here: Who am I to be? 	1
Twenty-four years ago I took the most mind-bending trip across North Korea. 	1
And you know what? She's not standing still. 	1
Everybody's looking away all of a sudden. 	1
If you look at the first clue for 1-across, it starts with the letter C, for corrupt, and just below that we have an O, for outfielder, and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down, you get cobalt horse, amber owl, silver ox, red donkey, and emerald rooster. 	1
Well, if you keep reading starting with 25-down, it says, "Oh, by the way, the sheep can be left blank." 	1
So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable, like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi." 	1
We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. 	1
I don't know if you've noticed, but there's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs. 	1
And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius -- well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars, but imagine you're out in the country, imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in December, we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. 	1
And so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening, we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. 	1
But this leads us to one final problem: If science is what scientists say it is, then isn't that just an appeal to authority? 	1
You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. 	1
The A is authenticity, just being yourself. 	1
So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction. 	1
Because I know what one language looks like, I can recognize other languages even when I'm not familiar with them. 	1
So this is really nice and helpful, but all this tells me is what I'm looking at. 	1
But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days, I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise, and we've been slow to respond to it. 	1
This week, as any week you care to look at, you'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country, but even when that's not going on, there's competition between countries, each one trying to shaft the next. 	1
I think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species. 	1
Why did I do this? Well, because the governments that I advise are very, very keen on knowing how they are regarded. 	1
They've spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy, building their own society and their own polity, but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward-looking than the first phase has been so far. 	1
And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change. 	1
More recently, looking at America in the last several decades, there's some reason to believe that shows like "The Cosby Show" radically changed American attitudes towards African-Americans, while shows like "Will and Grace" and "Modern Family" changed American attitudes towards gay men and women. 	1
On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people like me trying to figure out what was going on, and together we sort of loosely formed a group and we called it Safecast, and we decided we were going to try to measure the radiation and get the data out to everybody else, because it was clear that the government wasn't going to be doing this for us. 	1
So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware. 	1
in that dark decade of the 1990s that the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world. 	1
Now I've been talking for the last five minutes about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know exactly what I mean. 	1
They thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it's random. 	1
In regard to ecological crisis, we think nothing needs to be done just now, or others need to act before us. 	1
I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens. 	1
Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period. 	1
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you were just naturally great at? 	1
Have you ever been tempted to, and then gave in to the temptation, of looking through someone else's phone? 	1
We just looked at what wasn't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it. 	1
But for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations. 	1
 And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby, and this is just routine, it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress. 	1
Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle, the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature. 	1
Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs. 	1
So if there was a fertility issue or some problem, I had data to show: Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted, we somehow lost this baby. 	1
Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates, and when our prisons are safe, we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling. 	1
Well, Xcel fought back, and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this municipalization. 	1
In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama, there's an organization on campus called, kind of menacingly, the Machine, and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus, and for decades, the Machine has dominated student government elections. 	1
Now, as I say, these are just two examples drawn almost at random from the headlines. 	1
But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent, because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web-enabled life, you don't remember things anymore, you just look them up, then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back. 	1
And we also have, if you've read the book about the filter bubble, the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like. 	1
But you know, he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture, so we had to zoom out a lot. 	1
I have a Ph.D. in history of science and had you asked me 10 years ago if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally, had emotions, I would have said yes, but I'm not sure that I would have told you that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder, a Prozac prescription and a therapist. 	1
He looks like he's on a stakeout but he does this for many, many, many hours a day. 	1
But it's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in. 	1
So as I said in my book, we'll have a bumpy ride through this century. 	1
And by the way, our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question, and it's this: Consider two scenarios. 	1
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue as an observer, as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief, and as an activist, I looked at it as a defender of rights, but as a citizen journalist, I suddenly felt very vulnerable. 	1
As I end this talk, I just want to say that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets, but let us speak up. 	1
So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes, to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible, telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, or the LSST, possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy, in fact proof, if you should need it, that you should never allow a scientist or an engineer 	1
Now, thousands of discoveries will come from this project, but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access In the last five years, NASA has discovered over 1,000 planetary systems around nearby stars, but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system, and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough 	1
Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide, we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system, to asteroids beyond the orbits of Neptune and Mars, to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun. 	1
Some people think about a dark energy that changes with time, or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky. 	1
You know, for a vain female like myself, it's very hard to age in this culture. 	1
By the way, even if we have this equation, God + nothing = the world, there's already a problem: Why does God exist? 	1
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario. 	1
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss, that it's pregnant with being. 	1
So what kind of reality do we want to live in? 	1
I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy. 	1
I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. 	1
Well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing, which meant he'd gone and would not come back. 	1
To that end, Bageye and his friends, mostly Jamaican, exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura: Turn your best side to the world, show your best face to the world. 	1
And I even began to feel that this book may be perceived by my father as an act of filial devotion. 	1
We're going to order some medications for your symptoms, but I also want to refer you to a specialist, if that's okay." 	1
Now, specialists are a little hard to find in South Central Los Angeles, so she gave me this look, like, "Really?" 	1
Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare, usually says, well, let's look at your genes, let's look at how you're behaving. 	1
Okay, let's try another one, starting from the bottom and going through the top. 	1
Patient: Nothing. Neurologist: Nothing? Okay. 	1
So we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way. 	1
That's a hugely important goal, and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it, but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing. 	1
What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon. 	1
We, scientists -- You see that I'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other. 	1
Let's then look at the morpho butterfly, an example of an invisible technological competence of life, which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet, and let's zoom in on it. Again, Hubble is there. 	1
Let's look at the next answer here: women in school. 	1
Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment, even though 221B is just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address. 	1
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions. 	1
His voice is completely different, but he put his babysitter on the phone, and she was very nice to Randolph as well. 	1
And then we decided to take New York as a test case, and we looked at Lower Manhattan. 	1
will remember it used to be called The Smoke. 	1
Not just California — the incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of 400 million people who don't have electricity in India. 	1
We can have better growth, better climate, a better world. We can make, by managing those two transformations well, the next 100 years the best of centuries. 	1
Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti-theft device in cars. 	1
He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes, I saw inner peace and acceptance. 	1
So you ask yourself, how can we solve this and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets for these two and a half billion? 	1
First, they just don't have enough doctors, and where they do, their distribution is skewed against the poor, because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources. 	1
Take a look: 748 Haitian graduates by 2012, when cholera struck, nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed, and 110 had left Haiti altogether. 	1
So if you look at this, these are the best estimates we have of world GDP growth and rate of return on capital, average rates of return on capital, so you can see that during most of the history of mankind, the growth rate was very small, much lower than the rate of return, and then during the 20th century, it is really the population growth, very high in the postwar period, 	1
Well, we are very far from this, and from now, what's going on in the real estate sector, the energy sector, is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share. 	1
Yet in the same animal, if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep, what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain, and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep, the brain cells themselves seem to shrink, opening up spaces in between them, allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out. 	1
They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they'll be willing to listen as well. 	1
Now, there's all kinds of things to say about that mentality, the first of which is that the people who say that, who say that privacy isn't really important, they don't actually believe it, and the way you know that they don't actually believe it is that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter, with their actions, they take all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy. 	1
The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault realized that that model could be used not just for prisons but for every institution that seeks to control human behavior: schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces. 	1
In fact, whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance, people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable, and what they say is, "Oh, well in '1984,' there were monitors in people's homes, they were being watched at every given moment, and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face." 	1
GG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist is very simple, which is to make sure that every single document that's newsworthy and that ought to be disclosed and that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place end up uncovered. 	1
So far, most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city: potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps. 	1
So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet?  They don't look so pretty anymore, right? 	1
I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films. 	1
I took this picture of this little girl. 	1
You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state. 	1
It made its way up his neck, cutting off his ability to breathe, and stopped just beneath the eyes. 	1
Just 72 hours after his stroke, he had already embraced the totality of his condition. 	1
My son Isaac, when he was two, was diagnosed with autism, and he was this happy, hilarious, loving, affectionate little guy, but the metrics on his developmental evaluations, which looked at things like the number of words — at that point, none — communicative gestures and minimal eye contact, put his developmental level at that of a nine-month-old baby. 	1
And he looked at me very seriously and said, "Typed in the box." 	1
One billion people will need jobs in Africa, so if we don't grow our economies fast enough, we're sitting on a ticking time bomb, not just for Africa but for the entire world. 	1
You're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year, 2013. 	1
For us, it's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone. 	1
Now, stories like Naghma's unfortunately are all too common, and from the comforts of our home, we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women's rights. 	1
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash. 	1
It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God, this is just taking over my life. 	1
I just want you all to know that I am really glad that we are on this bus together, and this is my stop. 	1
Well, the reason of course is that associated with making calls and sending texts. 	1
These were just like someone's garage idea a few years ago, and now they're disrupting entire industries. 	1
Finally, think about new power being more than just an entity that scales things that make us have slightly better consumer experiences. 	1
What I'm suggesting is, when you connect with people around a shared interest and action, you're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future, and I think that's what we're looking at. 	1
In a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York, we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market are criminal gangs and cartels. 	1
And it changed because it makes you think, "Well, if there's a peace process, this is probably going to be over. 	1
You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally. 	1
So you may look on Centella as being an insignificant, humble weed, which, if destroyed, won't be missed. 	1
There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question. 	1
So we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy, and then we thought we were finished, we were really happy, but still, it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us, and they said, "You know, there's a boy flying the kite, but where is his kite?" 	1
It's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U.S. 	1
But since today is Tuesday, let me just say that legally regulating and taxing most of the drugs that are now criminalized would radically reduce the crime, violence, corruption and black markets, and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs, and improve public safety, and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes. 	1
Conversely, think about cigarettes: Nothing can both hook you and kill you like cigarettes. 	1
So this is what I've dedicated my life to, to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights, where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well, where people who love our drugs, people who hate drugs, 	1
Well, I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually — incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya, which is absolutely unknown outside of the region. 	1
Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance, and I have a question for you, and the question is this: You show up in places like the ones you just have shown us, and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. 	1
Now, this is the game we're playing against the bacteria, except we're not the cheetahs, we're the gazelles, and the bacteria would, just in the course of this little talk, would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant just by selection and trial and error, trying it over and over again. 	1
I mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right? 	1
Well, times may be hard for everyone, but try telling your patient making 35,000 dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. 	1
And this is just the beginning, You can create a Social Progress Index for any state, region, city or municipality. 	1
When something very exciting happens in my inner world, I've just got to run. 	1
Then he put his hands on his knees, he looked right at my 27-year-old kid, and said, "I don't know how to tell a 27-year-old this: Pete, you have ALS." 	1
And those naysayers, let's just talk a couple of stats, shall we? 	1
Now, this problem is not only a huge problem for the military, but it's also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field, which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body? 	1
So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue. 	1
Now, I hope that mayors do one day rule the world, but, you know, the fact is, we don't hear any conversation, really, about what is happening in the South. 	1
And by South, I mean Latin America, Africa, Asia, where violence in some cases is accelerating, where infrastructure is overstretched, and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality. 	1
And those young people I just mentioned, they're more digitally savvy and tech-aware than ever before. 	1
Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis, a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts 12 million people around the world. 	1
Mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped to document human rights violations using cameras. 	1
I need people to understand what the reality in the West Bank looks like. 	1
We are checking maps, looking at maps, double-checking the information, and looking also at the metadata of the material. 	1
One of Shackleton's men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station. 	1
You can see the ice in the foreground and the sort of rubbly rock behind that. 	1
But I'm also standing here saying, you know what, that cliche about the journey being more important than the destination? 	1
And companies will look for talents somewhere else. 	1
This is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday, and if you look at NRK2 over here, look what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show: 1.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program. 	1
If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June 2011, they will look like this, and as a TV producer, it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it. 	1
It actually took three hours before we got the first fish, and that's quite slow. 	1
Today, I want to show you a new kind of map. 	1
In a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid, you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between 1 and 5. 	1
So the math says then that what you should do in the first 37 percent of your dating window, you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential. 	1
Okay, so this method doesn't give you a 100 percent success rate, but there's no other possible strategy that can do any better. 	1
I also think that subconsciously, humans, we do sort of do this anyway. 	1
Okay, so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them. 	1
Tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that I want to share with you this afternoon: that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game-changer in journalism, in activism, and as I see it, in the political discourse as well. 	1
So we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page, and soon we had a quarter of a million followers. 	1
Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. 	1
Those are more of the second kind of grammar, which linguists often call usage, as opposed to grammar. 	1
We just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world, and then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it. 	1
The only thing I want to leave you with is the moment in which those men, some of them just huge when standing next to me, or the young boys - so young, but with an enormous pride, held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated, and read their poems with their voices completely broken. 	1
Then, we doubled the bet and wrote another book. 	1
The heart cracks under sad gazes, rides on storms that spread fire, lifts chests lowered by shame, knows that it's not just reading and going on, it also wishes to see the infinite blue. 	1
So I grew up in New York, I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact, and I went to New Utrecht High School and I graduated from Brooklyn College. 	1
That took eight years, and I'm so proud of it because we recycled all of it back here in South America. 	1
Now, when you see this example, you might be thinking, "Well, frugal innovation is low tech." 	1
So in 1900, as you can see, we were well within the limits of safety. 	1
Look, attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years. 	1
This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab "graduate student with tweezers."  So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps. 	1
When John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface, meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices, no matter how far they are from their own bodies, just by imagining what they want to do, our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help, of the psychiatry variety. 	1
Human waste, in its rawest form, finds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water, irrigation water, whatever water you see. 	1
Well, it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband that I have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about. 	1
They just took out their phones and looked for actual news. 	1
Remember the Zapatistas, the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico led by the masked, pipe-smoking, charismatic Subcomandante Marcos? 	1
In embracing these technologies, are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained? 	1
No, they come to these protests, just like before, with their friends, existing networks, and sometimes they do make new friends for life. 	1
The reality is we don't know Ebola extremely well. 	1
Well, when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment, what we can do is do a twin study. 	1
And then there are some that are, well, not so good. 	1
Well, with cards, most people tend to draw clear, more detailed, and more logical nodes. 	1
This was a book of Raphael paintings, the Renaissance artist, and by taking his work and remixing it, carving into it, I'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary. 	1
I'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials, weights, in order to hold things in place before I varnish so that I can push the form before I begin, so that something like this can become a piece like this, which is just made from a single dictionary. 	1
What's the use of life itself? What kind of question is that? 	1
 Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems. 	1
In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons, just like bees do. 	1
And within one week, my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. 	1
We just work together, and even, for example, when architects visit what we're doing, sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan. 	1
So they took away the architecture, they kept the base of the artwork, and they built an entirely new, much more biomorphic architecture on top of that. 	1
She said, "You know what? I'm really sorry, but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them." 	1
And I got the same kind of rejection there that I received when I was looking for the apartment. 	1
I kept looking, and I looked at the far end of the town in Mountain Home, and there was a small trailer park. 	1
And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. 	1
People may think it's an overnight success, but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that, I took life and education seriously. 	1
But it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important. 	1
Well, it depends on what you think of as our bodies. 	1
Well, each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells, but we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells. 	1
Now, you might think, well, we're human because of our DNA, but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes, depending on what you count exactly, but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes. 	1
With a sample size of just one child, no matter how much we love her, you don't really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average, but at two years old, she hasn't had an ear infection yet, so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one. 	1
So I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions, and they've also now, just over the past few years, been connected to a whole range of different diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, colon cancer, and even obesity. 	1
They had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging, and one day, we went walking, again as tourists, out into the forest, and within five minutes' walk, we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down, five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters from the ranger station. 	1
So he fills in his information, and then after that, all he has to do is click "send," and just like that, without understanding cryptography, and without doing anything different from how he writes email today, Bob has just sent an encrypted message. 	1
Because that wasn't real love, that love was just a sample, When it came to real love, they were a prime example. 	1
As many of you know, they're the result, usually, of trial and error. 	1
Now, I'm an architect, and for the past year and a half I've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying. 	1
And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today, what amazes me is this building's ambition. 	1
Over 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS, and here are just a few of those. 	1
And when you look across the animal kingdom, you find lots of peripheral devices. 	1
So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera, you're feeling that in your back, and amazingly, blind people got pretty good just by feeling it in the small of their back. 	1
And while this has been going on, I have been feeling this, and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time, and that's a new kind of human experience, because now I can know how everyone's doing and how much you're loving this. 	1
I mean, isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue because the visual cortex is still there, ready to process, and that that is needed as part of it? 	1
DE: That's a great question. We actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in. 	1
And I get it: it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional, had a soul, and was once unbroken. 	1
My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family, and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand, and then eventually I realized she was reliving 1998, reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night, reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open, and reliving a time when both of my parents feared 	1
It served to recontextualize my experiences, and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different. 	1
And you know what shocked me, although it shouldn't have, was other research last year that determined humiliation than either happiness or even anger. 	1
It's also not just about saving myself. 	1
So instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms, my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality. 	1
So we were not only thinking about development, but we were thinking about the program, thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another, between one neighbor and another. 	1
The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans. 	1
Not the terrible twos; he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again. 	1
And I've just started a three-year think tank for autism. 	1
So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. 	1
Okay, anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own.  So we all face challenges, and we all face the dark unknown, which is endemic to most challenges, which is what most of us fear, okay? 	1
Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry. 	1
CA: Well, Daniel, you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way. 	1
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. 	1
1971, I had just turned 14 years of age, and she handed me this headline. 	1
On the question of is the U.S. containing China, they say, "No, look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment." 	1
So apart from all of that, it's just fine and dandy, the U.S.-China relationship. 	1
You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions. 	1
So we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality? So we started looking at inequality, and we did some large-scale surveys So we asked two questions: Do people know what kind of level of inequality we have? 	1
Imagine I took all the people in the U.S. 	1
It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. 	1
If you are a parent, you know that kids love to keep making circles. 	1
And if the roof is too high, you see only the ceiling. 	1
The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know. 	1
And when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here, they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth. 	1
Now, finally, if somebody tells you that looking for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them, let me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong. 	1
I wanted to be part of that, and I kind of sat around at the edge going, "Hoo hoo!"  Now, incidentally, what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing, which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and could not do in toilets on trains. 	1
I just cared about the laughter, and actually, as a neuroscientist, I've come to care about it again. 	1
There's a point in there where I'm just, like, you've got to get some air in there, mate, because he just sounds like he's breathing out. 	1
It's been well-described and well-observed in primates, but you also see it in rats, and wherever you find it -- humans, primates, rats -- you find it associated with things like tickling. 	1
they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes. 	1
We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones, and it turns out that they're very dense and compact. 	1
To be honest, by personality, I'm just not much of a crier. 	1
And not just to tears, but to actually stop the genocide. 	1
She sat down with me for hours, just ushered me in to the world of poverty. 	1
Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do is give you some advice, and call the sheriff's office tomorrow. 	1
And yet, for some reason, this is okay for poor people. 	1
Almost all criminal justice systems, they start out broken and corrupt, but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment. 	1
But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise. 	1
Looked me in the eye, fear consuming his face, and said, "Son, I'm sorry, but you can't act the same as your white friends. 	1
If we look under the hood, this is what we find: basically the same thing. 	1
GG: I need you to stick out your arm for science, roll up your sleeve a bit, So what I'm going to do, I'm putting electrodes on your arm, and you're probably wondering, I just said I'm going to record from your brain, what am I doing with your arm? 	1
So now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the -- It's going to feel a little bit weird at first, this is going to feel like a --  You know, when you lose your free will, and someone else becomes your agent, it does feel a bit strange. 	1
This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova, because it looks like an exploding star. 	1
The problem's actually a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending poor kids to prison, we're saddling poor kids with court fees, with probation and parole restrictions, with low-level warrants, we're asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest, and we're asking them to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color, not for the purposes of promoting public safety, but to make arrest counts, to line city coffers. 	1
When Tori returned home, she was feeling disheartened, she was broke. 	1
Because it's hollow, it's lightweight, light enough to be lifted by just a few men, or, apparently, one woman. 	1
And while you're there, you can also see Green School -- we keep building classrooms there each year -- as well as an updated fairy mushroom house. 	1
You know, yeah.  But instead, the flag of Amsterdam looks like this. 	1
As we move more and more into cities, the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place, but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself, especially today, as the populace is becoming more design-aware. 	1
I barely did it, because I found it boring and painful, and as a result, it took me another six weeks to get better. 	1
MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren't going to out-license the drug to a satellite communications expert, they weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all, and they thought I didn't have the expertise, finally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me and develop enough credibility. 	1
And then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn, it may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard, it's just that I don't know how to do it." 	1
That's because Kepler-186f orbits a red star, and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there, if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis, it has different pigments and looks red. 	1
Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me." 	1
And in this case, I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space. 	1
Well, in the best case, we will find an image of another exo-Earth. 	1
Well, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently, but there was the perception that they did. 	1
I remember, I was telling one of the guys, "Hey, mate, look, I really want to learn how to surf." 	1
And most of the minorities that are at that sort of level are non-executive board directors. 	1
If you enroll in private high school tutoring, go to your local state school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center. 	1
Take out that new grad who looks totally out of place -- 'cause that was me -- and open doors for them, not in a tokenistic way, because we're not victims, but show them the opportunities because opening up your world will make you realize that you have access to doors that they didn't even know existed and you didn't even know they didn't have. 	1
These include the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, as well as failed attacks, such as the time when a man named Faisal Shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square. 	1
To do this, agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide, all looking for anyone who might be dangerous. 	1
It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand. 	1
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola, and I'd been there a few times before, and I'd gone back to present this book I'd made, to show them the pictures, to get into a discussion with them, to say, "This is how I saw you. This is how I love you. 	1
So I wanted this debate. It was very, very, very emotional, and one night we were sitting around the campfire, and I have to be honest, I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink, and I was sort of sitting under the stars going, "This is great, you've seen my pictures, we love each other."  And I'm a little bit slow, and I looked around me, and I said, 	1
And when you look closely at this picture, there is a reflection of me in his eyes, so I think perhaps he has my soul, and I'm in his soul, and whilst these pictures look at you, I ask you to look at them. 	1
In each movie, you're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do, and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are. 	1
I've just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points, because the really critical point is that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species-specific cultural learning that we do. 	1
LS: You know, they look really impressive in our experiments, but think about what they look like in real life, right? 	1
I mean, you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology as a matter of practice, but it's not just a difference in quantity, it's a difference in kind. 	1
Well, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought, "No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger." 	1
GoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998, was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic. 	1
And --  -- and along the gender continuum, I will be living into males as well. 	1
Yeah, I was telling you, you know, I think I have in all my time I have had at least one client with that name, so this won't be the first time I had BERT all over me. 	1
But you see the sign? You get it? P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us. 	1
Well no, that older fella, he would still come to find me in the convent. 	1
So there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life, right? 	1
It's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first. 	1
Maybe I am finally fixed, maybe I just don't care, maybe God finally listened to my prayers. 	1
Pain just kept accumulating in his life. 	1
So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening. 	1
Similarly, the orange box on the side here, it's a school bus, and we have to treat that differently as well. 	1
We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time, the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like. 	1
 Now, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there, so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly. 	1
When we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one, though many had tried, but whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her and not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days right down to 72. 	1
 Well, I have had a great blessing as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe. 	1
Well, that's what goes on in our country. 	1
And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network into three different years, represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. 	1
And finally, we can really see this shift, again, when we look at ecosystems around our planet. 	1
As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes, the entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would. 	1
There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple. 	1
We spoke to 50,000 people directly, and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials, radio commercials and posters. 	1
Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know -- But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time. 	1
And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together, and basically said, look, we can't go on with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts. 	1
Which, given this, is probably just as well. 	1
 Okay, they would not be able to do that very often. 	1
For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. 	1
Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else -- the sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls. 	1
Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France, because, you know, France. 	1
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!" 	1
They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented. 	1
Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table. 	1
Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure. 	1
And the way this looks is shown in this graph. 	1
You can just say, "Well, these factors change with age," but you don't really know if they do something about aging. 	1
So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it. 	1
It's an object that behaves like a wave, so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other, but can follow multiple pathways at the same time. 	1
They were going to miss the fall fishing season, which was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod. 	1
So look at those four bright objects, and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. 	1
CA: It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook and stepped up your mathematical career. 	1
JS: I think in the last three or four years, hedge funds have not done especially well. 	1
JS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works. 	1
Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another? 	1
When we say of somebody that he's "in it for the money," we are not just being descriptive. 	1
And so you people -- pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe -- you people should be asking yourself a question, Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design? 	1
Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins -- she's done that. 	1
Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just getting out of the way, aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end. 	1
BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs -- he was the former number one player, he wasn't just some hacker, by the way. 	1
And we catch ourselves -- I mean, I catch myself to this day. 	1
They just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking, and get into the solution. 	1
What if we realized that the experts we are looking for, the experts we need to follow, are poor people themselves? 	1
So the black woman says to the white woman, "When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror, what do you see?" 	1
Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror," she said, "I see a black woman. 	1
I mean, if you were to say to my students, "There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States," they'd say, "Well of course you'd say that. 	1
They expect their partners, their spouses, their wives, to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are. 	1
So I decided I would pose this riddle to them, just to see, to gauge the level of change. 	1
And this was a reality that really struck me, because of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem. 	1
The first part of this three-step passionate work framework is becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself, because if you don't know what you're looking for, you're never going to find it. 	1
And the Strengths Finder 2.0 is a book and also an online tool. 	1
We have this little group. We go on physical adventures, and recently, I found myself in a kind of precarious spot. 	1
And I see this one kid, something didn't look right. 	1
We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailingly polite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food. 	1
I started sketching out these plans to make a photo, and I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee -- this is an endangered bird, so it takes special permission to do. 	1
And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century -- shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 -- just as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades. 	1
So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us." 	1
About 10 years ago -- I've been a runner most of my life -- I went for a run, a Saturday morning run, I came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move. 	1
And I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that. 	1
 In addition to building these small robots, we also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here. 	1
Well, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community. 	1
Well, according to the governments of the world, yes we can. 	1
And also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits. 	1
So let's get a little bit more optimistic and say, what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well-being? 	1
We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack, but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman, it's actually harmful? 	1
And I like to write bass lines, so they both ended up kind of as bass lines. 	1
 But I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward are terrorist code names. 	1
 During our visit, McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily, his wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them, to never be able to hold their hands. 	1
It's interesting that as I talk to people, my scientific colleagues as well as others, there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this. 	1
BG: Now, colleagues of yours, like George Church, for example, at Harvard, they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety. 	1
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned, and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter. 	1
And soon word went around about Doaa's survival, and a phone number was published on Facebook. 	1
But when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there, and yet they look incredibly well-exposed. 	1
So, they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers, who said -- well, they weren't going to talk in jargon. 	1
Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards. 	1
If we become aware of the constellation, the terms and conditions of communication, it not only broadens our horizon, it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview, our specific social, political or aesthetic conventions. 	1
BG: That's just to add the detail to your talk. 	1
There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light. 	1
If we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us. 	1
You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore, you're looking for knowledge, which is something way more complicated and delicate. 	1
It's just her in the picture, not even the President. 	1
Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much --  Now we have sneaker addictions. 	1
The sneaker market is just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using supply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit. 	1
For 15 years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO every single weekend. 	1
 But, uh oh, there's a dolphin, a bigger brain with more convolutions. 	1
Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened." 	1
I started to investigate by looking through books, reaching out to psychiatrists, going to museums, libraries, etc. 	1
And they experience horrible anxiety attacks -- panic attacks, not just minor fears. 	1
He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel. 	1
After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner -- I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide. 	1
Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different, and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today. 	1
So after this piece was made, the dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California, brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try "Hunger," and he took off the goggles, and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot. 	1
Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral. 	1
And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers, other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns, with some being limited to a single territory, like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs. 	1
But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription," with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representations of hands in the middle, and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right. 	1
I look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface. 	1
But free diving is more than just that. 	1
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care. 	1
And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people, "You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?" 	1
CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there. 	1
Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum. 	1
AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year. 	1
OK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time. 	1
And so here I was saying, OK, I hear you, I understand what you're saying, but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions, then our survival is on the line. 	1
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry, and you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused. 	1
There was so much pain and loneliness, there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes, because in the gaze with that total stranger, that you never even say one word -- everything happened. 	1
Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil, then it's going to be in Australia, then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere. 	1
And this is to experience a kind of simple method, how you go back to simplicity in your own life. 	1
Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know, and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now? 	1
Now, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book. 	1
 CA: Where are you going? You look so happy. 	1
Did you know, and this will ruin your day, that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours? 	1
When I took time off to meet my newborn son, I lost my job." 	1
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old. 	1
But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward. 	1
I remember thinking I was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream. 	1
This creature would have to be vegetarian, it would have to be fast growing, it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile, that EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for. 	1
And Brendan took some analyses across this coral -- you can see the marks -- and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands, so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean, corals can record seasonal changes, which is pretty spectacular. 	1
But now, you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now, and they want to humiliate their father, which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you, pay all your tuition,  especially when you have 50 million people that just go around and call you "the loser." 	1
So just to explain to you kind of how this works: If I want to build something in the UK, like a cemetery for example, then I have to apply for planning permission first. 	1
But I mean, like -- really, who does this? Right? 	1
So what I find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death. 	1
PM: Well, as we grow older, and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys, what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive? 	1
LT: I have to use a lot of social media -- You be quiet now. And so --  LT: And I look through my emails, I look through my texts to find my friends, so I can answer them as quickly as possible, because I know they need my counsel. 	1
LT: When we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships, and I was so surprised to see how many books, how much research has been done recently -- JF: And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful. 	1
JF: Oh -- LT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much, we found we had so much in common and we're so different. 	1
I mean, that's the general, conventional thought. 	1
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject. 	1
Gardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses. 	1
In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on, not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value, a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position. 	1
You have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya, for example, and yet Europe looked totally unprepared. 	1
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. 	1
And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager, took pity on her, and said, "Never forget ... only for you." 	1
It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth. 	1
Even though we in law enforcement say, "You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this." 	1
No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good! 	1
  You'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about: "Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long -- you can't do it! 	1
Because at the end of the day, if we took care of the needs of the people, if we got to the root cause, the crime would take care of itself. 	1
Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths. 	1
They can take rocks within the caves, and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks, much like the rings of a tree, and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times. 	1
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region, and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline, many hundreds of feet below current levels. 	1
In places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba, we're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves, and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions. 	1
 So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. 	1
You might think that these plants look dead, but they're not. 	1
Well, the current world population is around 7 billion. 	1
This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011, where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them -- amongst other things -- increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain. 	1
The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again. 	1
You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. 	1
This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance. 	1
But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well. 	1
And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy. 	1
He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures -- decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums. 	1
I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, but not this good. 	1
It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. 	1
And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion. 	1
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot. 	1
But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over. 	1
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. 	1
She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" 	1
Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. 	1
A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat. 	1
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race. 	1
Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says. 	1
I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs, and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals, for people taking two drugs, where each drug alone did not change glucose, but together I saw a strong signal." 	1
When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20. 	1
And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up. 	1
I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said, "We wanted to do this study, Google said no, it's kind of a bummer." 	1
I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting. 	1
Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. 	1
Last year -- if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States, almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar. 	1
Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep. 	1
Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars. 	1
And so when you go through that growth, you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time. 	1
Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. 	1
You see, we the people didn't want democracy. 	1
That's how it looked 10 years ago, and that's how it looked 20 years ago. 	1
My uncle started using a walker to walk, and to take a turn, he literally had to take one step at a time, like this, and it took forever. 	1
She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?" 	1
And what we discovered was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan. 	1
The idea is to have enough balloons so as one balloon floats out of your area, there's another balloon ready to float into place, handing off the internet connection, just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway. 	1
Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms just as clearly as I can see all of you. 	1
But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same. 	1
And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other. 	1
My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant, they don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country," and then give up. 	1
Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose, paint the background, and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone. 	1
You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green. 	1
When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which -- I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that's every two months, roughly two or three months. 	1
CA:  LT: And we were in this bad spot, where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways, I was the kind of break point, where I could not scale to the point where I could work with thousands of people. 	1
I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI, I'd die there. 	1
But the other reason is -- I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing, Linux would never have been what it is. 	1
I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day, code tends to be somewhat black and white. 	1
There's often a fairly good way to decide, this is done correctly and this is not done well. 	1
So to understand this, let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like. 	1
But we looked really, really, really hard, and the data were good. 	1
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five-year career break early in her career. 	1
She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results. 	1
Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department. 	1
 The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool, and as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word, just one word. 	1
So Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967, when this movie was released. 	1
So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination." 	1
But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. 	1
This continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka contains more than 80 million people and most of Japan's economy. 	1
If we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders, we see more trade, more investment and more stability. 	1
One region we know could especially use this kind of thinking is the Middle East. 	1
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have. 	1
Well, once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding, then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement. 	1
Well, what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps, perhaps here is hope, here is a possible chance. 	1
We've only just started our work on climate change. 	1
Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book, and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it. 	1
And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me. 	1
It could've just been another day -- a Thursday, perhaps -- among the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs. 	1
But go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri, and human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special. 	1
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors. 	1
She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses. 	1
Well, it turns out that the data shows among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts. 	1
These are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness. 	1
Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya And our repayment rates are above 90 percent -- which, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates. 	1
If you look at these things topographically, if you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word, you can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place. 	1
It's the ability to move from a statistical approach where you're a dot in the ocean, to a personalized approach, where we read all these books and we get an understanding of exactly how you are. 	1
Things like vaccination, timely screening and of course, stopping smoking. 	1
You take a common material like gold, and you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles, and it changes from looking gold to looking red. 	1
And death is just a problem we haven't discovered the solution to yet. 	1
Well, to a very last degree, it is these young students. 	1
But not just simple simulations -- with top universities like MIT, to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students. 	1
So now, let's take a closer look at the younger children. 	1
Looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children's lies. 	1
Rich, well-connected brothel owners can comply with the regulations, but more marginalized people find those hoops impossible to jump through. 	1
When France temporarily brought in the Swedish model two years ago, ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigilante attacks against people working on the street. 	1
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy? He had a stroke." 	1
So much so, the word "father" -- I have six kids by the way. 	1
One of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like if you could create a virtual curator's table where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?" 	1
But I just wanted to highlight one very quick example, which is very timely: "The Bedroom." 	1
Moving on from here very quickly, there is kind of a playful idea, actually, to illustrate the point of access, and I'm going to go quite quickly on this one. 	1
And we haven't really done anything special here, just fed the collection. 	1
So she said to us, "Look, I've been heading this department for the last two years. 	1
They're constantly on SMS, on Facebook and on WhatsApp. 	1
So today, when you go to a school in Haryana, things look different. 	1
The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. 	1
Each of these forests is just two years old. 	1
And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years. 	1
